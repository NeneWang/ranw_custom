Description of Business COMPANY OVERVIEW Green Hygienics Holdings Inc. (the "Company") was incorporated in the State of Nevada on June 12, 2008 as Silver Bay Resources Inc. On June 30, 2010, the Company changed its name to Takedown Entertainment Inc and on July 24, 2012, the Company changed its name to Green Hygienics Holdings Inc. The Company seeks to be an innovative, full-scope, science-driven, premium hemp cultivation and branding enterprise focused on the cultivation and processing of industrial hemp for the purpose of extracting cannabidiol CBD ). On June 1, 2017, the Company accepted the resignations of Rick Powell, Jim Loseth, and David Ashby as Directors and Officers of the Company and the Company accepted the appointment of Ronald Loudoun as President, Secretary, Treasurer, Interim Chief Financial Officer, and Director of the Company. On October 30, 2018, Rick Powell Powell transferred 13,500,000 common shares of the Company by way of a Gifting Agreement to Alita Capital Inc. Alita ), a company controlled by Ronald Loudoun, and on October 30th, 2018, Wilderness Custom Exteriors Ltd. transferred 9,000,000 common shares by way of a Gifting Agreement to Alita. Effective April 29, 2019, the Company entered into a definitive agreement with Coastal Labs, LLC Coastal ), a California limited liability company to acquire all of the assets of Coastal. The Company is no longer pursuing this acquisition. In June, 2019, the Company formed two wholly owned subsidiaries, Coastal Labs NC LLC Coastal NC and Green Hygienics NC LLC Green NC for the purpose of registering as an industrial hemp processor and cultivator in the State of North Carolina pursuant to the North Carolina Industrial Hemp Pilot Program. On June 14, 2019, the Company secured from the County of San Diego Department of Agriculture, Weights and Measures a registration for industrial hemp cultivation as a grower. On July 22, 2019, the Company secured licenses for the processing of hemp in the state of North Carolina. The licenses were granted to the Company s newly formed subsidiary, Coastal NC, by the North Carolina Industrial Hemp Commission. The Company s second subsidiary in the state is Green NC, which will be partnering for cultivation this year with the intention of meeting the earnings qualification to be licensed on its own for next year s cultivation. On August 26, 2019, the Company the completed the acquisition of 824 acres of land known as the Potrero Ranch Property, located near San Diego, California for a purchase price of 4 million. The Company is utilizing the land and buildings for industrial hemp for CBD cultivation. The property includes over 400,000 square feet of outbuildings that are currently being converted into greenhouses. The Company entered into an agreement payable with the seller of the property for 2,750,000 for a portion of the purchase price. The terms of the agreement are monthly payments of interest only at the rate of 6 per annum. This debt is secured by a promissory note secured by a deed of trust on the real property. The maturity date of the debt is August 23, 2024. The Company also entered into an agreement payable for 1,760,000 with monthly payments of interest only at the rate of 15 per annum. This debt is also secured by a promissory note secured by a second charge on the deed of trust on the real property. The maturity date of this debt is August 15, 2024. In October 2019, the Company entered into an agreement to purchase the real property located at 13795 Blaisdell Place, Poway, California 92064. The closing conditions were not met and the Company is no longer pursuing this facility. In April 2020, the Company received USDA Organic Certification for its 824-acre farm and 400,000 square feet of greenhouse space. The Company considers the USDA Organic Certification to be one of the most recognized certifications among US consumers and provides another level of assurance to shoppers who may be concerned about the safety of CBD products. In addition to assuring that no synthetic fertilizers, pesticides, or herbicides have been used in the cultivation of hemp, the USDA organic certification ensures that farmers are using tillage and cultivation practices that maintain or improve the condition of soil and minimize soil erosion through crop rotations, cover crops and the application of plant and animal materials. 3 Table of Contents We had 507,312 in cash as at July 31, 2021. We anticipate that we will incur approximately 240,000 for administrative expenses, including professional legal and accounting expenses associated with compliance with our periodic reporting requirements over the next twelve months. We will need additional funding for debt obligations and for the cultivation and processing of industrial hemp for the purpose of extracting CBD. We are contemplating raising additional capital to finance our business operations. It is anticipated that funding for the Company will come from one or more of the following means: engaging in an offering of our stock, engaging in borrowing, or locating a joint venture partner or partners. (See Liquidity and Capital Resources for more information). On March 2, 2021, the Company entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the Primordia APA with Primordia, LLC Primordia ), a Nevada limited liability company. Pursuant to the Primordia APA, the Company acquired from Primordia certain assets for the purchase price of 431,137. The Company paid Primordia 25,000 and issued a 406,137 Promissory Note (the Note ). The Note matures March 2, 2022, and carries a per annum interest rate of 4.75 . On March 15, 2021, the Company entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the Castillo APA with Castillo Seed L.L.C. Castillo ), a Puerto Rico limited liability company. Pursuant to the Castillo APA, the Company acquired from Castillo certain assets per the Castillo APA in exchange for 60,000 shares of restricted common stock. On April 14, 2021, the Company entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the Admay APA with Admay, Inc Admay ), a Wyoming company. Pursuant to the Admay APA, the Company can acquire from Admay certain assets per the APA in exchange for up to 2,822,000 (the Purchase Price ). The Purchase Price will be a combination of cash and restricted shares of common stock of the Company. On April 15, 2021, the APA was consummated and the Company agreed to pay 162,400 for the purchase of the brands American Hemp and Diablo related to hemp cigarettes only and part of the inventory (the Initial Purchase ). The Company is not obligated to buy any additional inventory. As of July 31, 2021, the Company had paid 10,000 of the Initial Purchase. On August 20, 2021, Green Hygienics Properties, LLC GHP executed a Purchase and Sale Agreement (the PSA to acquire 95,625+- acres, located in Lincoln County, North Carolina (the Lincoln Property ). The Company is the sole member of GHP, and Mr. Loudoun, the Company s CEO is the Manager of GHP. The property located just outside of Charlotte, North Carolina, includes approximately 170,000 square feet of industrial buildings. The Company plans to utilize the Lincoln Property to launch its industrial hemp manufacturing division, with a goal to produce hemp derived food grade products and fiber for textiles. Pursuant to the PSA, the closing for the purchase of the Lincoln Property is to occur on or before November 30, 2021, subject to due diligence, for a cash payment of 2,400,000, of which 25,000 has been put into an escrow account. BANKRUPTCY OR SIMILAR PROCEEDINGS We have not been the subject of a bankruptcy, receivership or similar proceedings. PRODUCTS AND SERVICES On August 24, 2019, the Company executed a Purchase and Sale Agreement to acquire the 824 Potrero ranch Property near San Diego, California. The Company utilizes the land and building for industrial hemp for CBD cultivation. The Company s business model includes generating revenues from the sale of hemp and premium-grade CBD products, creating trusted global consumer brands, developing valuable intellectual property and growing rapidly through strategic acquisitions and development. 4 Table of Contents The Company focuses on hemp cultivation and is an innovative, full-scope, science-based premium hemp cultivation and branding enterprise focused on the cultivation and processing of industrial hemp for the purpose of extracting cannabidiol CBD ). Utilizing the land and building for the production of industrial hemp for CBD cultivation, the Company s business model includes generating revenues from the sale of hemp and premium-grade CBD products, creating trusted global consumer brands, developing valuable intellectual property and growing rapidly through strategic acquisitions and development. MARKETS AND CUSTOMERS Industries as diverse as cosmetics, food and beverage, and pharmaceuticals are potential clients for the sale and purchase of CBD (cannabidiol) derived from industrial hemp. Licensed dispensaries, pharmacies, and general retail market which includes cafes, smoke shops, grocery stores are buyers for products containing CBD derived from industrial hemp. COMPETITION Competition in the hemp industry is increasing steadily. Some of the biggest names in the hemp industry expect to make their presence known in the global market. REGULATORY CONSIDERATIONS The Hemp Farming Act of 2018 removed hemp from the list of Schedule 1 controlled substances (defined as less than 0.3 THC), making it an ordinary agricultural commodity. There is the potential for the FDA to introduce new regulations for the industry. EMPLOYEES The Company currently has 20 plus part time and full-time employees at the Potrero Ranch property. The number of employees will fluctuate dependent of the needs at the ranch and the growth stages of the crop. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENDITURES We have not incurred any research or development expenditures since our incorporation. PATENTS AND TRADEMARKS On April 14, 2021, in conjunction with the Admay Asset Purchase Agreement, the Company acquired the brands American Hemp and Diablo related to hemp cigarettes only. Item 1A. Risk Factors THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH AN INVESTMENT IN OUR COMMON STOCK. BEFORE MAKING A DECISION CONCERNING THE PURCHASE OF OUR SECURITIES, YOU SHOULD CAREFULLY CONSIDER THE FOLLOWING FACTORS AND OTHER INFORMATION IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT WHEN YOU EVALUATE OUR BUSINESS. Business Risks: We are entering into a new business, the construction of hemp growing facilities, and we expect to incur operating losses for the foreseeable future. We were incorporated on June 12, 2008. We have no way to evaluate the likelihood that our business will be successful. We have had minimal revenues as of the date of this annual report. The Company s present business model is as an innovative, full-scope, science-driven, premium hemp cultivation and branding enterprise focused on the cultivation and processing of industrial hemp for cannabidiol CBD ). The Company s business model includes generating revenues from the sale of hemp and premium-grade CBD products, creating trusted global consumer brands, developing valuable intellectual property, and growing the Company through strategic acquisitions. Potential investors should be aware of the difficulties normally encountered by fledging construction companies and the high rate of failure of such enterprises. The likelihood of success must be considered in light of the problems, expenses, difficulties, complications, and delays encountered in connection with the regulatory hurdles surrounding this new industry. 5 Table of Contents We have yet to earn significant revenue to achieve profitability and our ability to sustain our operations is dependent on our ability to raise additional financing to complete our program if warranted. As a result, our independent auditors believe there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. We have an accumulated deficit of 58,885,730 as at July 31, 2021. Our future is dependent upon our ability to obtain financing and upon future profitable operations from the development of our business. These factors raise substantial doubt that we will be able to continue as a going concern. Our independent auditors have expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. This opinion could materially limit our ability to raise additional funds by issuing new debt or equity securities or otherwise. If we fail to raise sufficient capital when needed, we will not be able to complete our business plan. We may have to liquidate our business and you may lose your investment. You should consider our auditor s comments when determining if an investment in our company is suitable. Because of the unique difficulties and uncertainties inherent in hemp growing facility construction and management industry, we face a high risk of business failure. You should be aware that the hemp growing industry is a new industry. Consequently, the likelihood that there will be a high rate of failure of such enterprises. The likelihood of success must be considered in light of the problems, expenses, difficulties, complications and delays encountered in connection with the regulatory environment in which we must adhere to. These potential problems include, but are not limited to, unanticipated problems relating to obtaining building permits, licenses to grow hemp, and the ability to market the hemp grown. If the results of our program do not reveal viable commercialization options, we may decide to abandon our venture into the hemp growing industry. Our ability to continue in the hemp growing industry will be dependent upon our possessing adequate capital resources when needed. If no funding is available, we may be forced to abandon our operations. Because of the inherent dangers involved in the hemp growing construction industry and the management of the facilities, there is a risk that we may incur liability or damages as we conduct our business. The growing of hemp involves numerous hazards. As a result, we may become subject to liability for such hazards, which we cannot insure or against which we may elect not to insure. At the present time we have no insurance to cover against these hazards. The payment of such liabilities may result in our inability to complete our planned program and/or obtain additional financing to fund our program. As we undertake the construction of hemp growing facilities, we will be subject to compliance with government regulation that may increase the anticipated cost of our program. There are several governmental regulations that could materially increase the costs of managing the facilities. We will be subject to regulations and laws as we carry out our program. We will require licenses to grow and process hemp in the United States and Canada. There is a risk that new regulations could increase our costs of doing business and prevent us from carrying out our growing operations. Because we have no operating history in the hemp industry, we may not succeed. We have no specific operating history in procuring, building out or leasing real estate for agricultural purposes, specifically hemp grow facilities, or with respect to any other activity in the hemp industry. Moreover, we are subject to all risks inherent in a developing a new business enterprise. Our likelihood of success must be considered in light of the problems, expenses, difficulties, complications, and delays frequently encountered in connection with establishing a new business and the competitive and regulatory environment in which we operate. You should further consider, among other factors, our prospects for success in light of the risks and uncertainties encountered by companies that, like us, are in their early stages. For example, unanticipated expenses, delays and or complications with build outs, zoning issues, legal disputes with neighbors, local governments, communities and or tenants. We may not successfully address these risks and uncertainties or successfully implement our operating strategies. If we fail to do so, it could materially harm our business to the point of having to cease operations and could impair the value of our common stock to the point investors may lose their entire investment. 6 Table of Contents Because our business is dependent upon continued market acceptance by consumers, any negative trends will adversely affect our business operations. We are substantially dependent on continued market acceptance and proliferation of consumers of hemp. We believe that as hemp becomes more accepted consumer demand will continue to grow. And while we believe that the market and opportunity in the hemp space continues to grow, we cannot predict the future growth rate and size of the market. Any negative outlook on the hemp industry will adversely affect our business operations. Laws and regulations affecting the regulated hemp industry are constantly changing, which could detrimentally affect our proposed operations and we cannot predict the impact that future regulations may have on us. Local, state, and federal hemp laws and regulations are broad in scope and subject to evolving interpretations, which could require us to incur substantial costs associated with compliance or alter our business plan. In addition, violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could disrupt our business and result in a material adverse effect on its operations. In addition, it is possible that regulations may be enacted in the future that will be directly applicable to our proposed business. We cannot predict the nature of any future laws, regulations, interpretations or applications, nor can we determine what effect additional governmental regulations or administrative policies and procedures, when and if promulgated, could have on our business. FDA regulation of hemp and the possible registration of facilities where hemp is grown could negatively affect the industry which would directly affect our financial condition. The FDA may issue rules and regulations including CGMPs (certified good manufacturing practices) related to the growth, cultivation, harvesting and processing of hemp. Clinical trials may be needed to verify efficacy and safety. It is also possible that the FDA would require that facilities where hemp is grown be registered with the FDA and comply with certain federally prescribed regulations. In the event that some or all of these regulations are imposed, we do not know what the impact would be on the hemp industry, what costs, requirements and possible prohibitions may be enforced. If we or our tenants are unable to comply with the regulations and or registration as prescribed by the FDA, we and/or our tenants may be unable to continue to operate their and our business in its current form or at all. Because our business model depends upon the availability of private financing, any change in our ability to raise money will adversely affect our financial condition. Our ability to operate, engage in the business activities that we have planned, and achieve positive financial performance depends, in large measure, on our ability to obtain financing in amounts and on terms that are favorable. Because we are liable for hazardous substances on our properties, environmental liabilities are possible and can be costly. Federal, state, and local laws impose liability on a landowner for releases or the otherwise improper presence on the premises of hazardous substances. This liability is without regard to fault for, or knowledge of, the presence of such substances. A landowner may be held liable for hazardous materials brought onto a property before it acquired title and for hazardous materials that are not discovered until after it sells the property. Similar liability may occur under applicable state law. Sellers of properties may make only limited representations as to the absence of hazardous substances. If any hazardous materials are found within our properties in violation of law at any time, we may be liable for all cleanup costs, fines, penalties, and other costs. This potential liability will continue after we sell the properties and may apply to hazardous materials present within the properties before we acquire the properties. If losses arise from hazardous substance contamination which cannot be recovered from a responsible party, the financial viability of the properties may be adversely affected. It is possible that we will purchase properties with known or unknown environmental problems which may require material expenditures for remediation. If we are found non-compliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act, we will be subject to significant liabilities. 7 Table of Contents If any of our properties are not in compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, as amended (the ADA ), we may be required to pay for any required improvements. Under the ADA, public accommodations must meet certain federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons. The ADA requirements could require significant expenditures and could result in the imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants. We cannot assure that ADA violations do not or will not exist at any of our properties. The recent global COVID-19 outbreak has significantly affected our business and operations. The potential impact and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global economy and our business are difficult to assess or predict. Potential impacts include the following: Our customer prospects and our existing customers may experience slowdowns in their businesses, which in turn may result in reduced demand for our products, lengthening of sales cycles, loss of customers, and difficulties in collections. Certain of our employees are working from home significantly more frequently than they have historically, which may result in decreased employee productivity and morale with increased unwanted employee attrition. We continue to incur fixed costs and are deriving reduced or no benefit from those costs. We may continue to experience disruptions to our growth planning, such as for facilities and expansion. We anticipate incurring costs in returning to work, including changes to the workplace, such as space planning, food service, and amenities. We may be subject to legal liability for safe workplace claims. Our critical vendors could go out of business. Our in-person marketing events, including customer user conferences, have been canceled and we may continue to experience prolonged delays in our ability to reschedule or conduct in-person marketing events and other sales and marketing activities. Our marketing, sales, professional services, and support organizations are accustomed to extensive face-to-face customer and partner interactions, and conducting business virtually is unproven. Any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. More generally, the COVID-19 pandemic has and is expected to continue to adversely affect economies and financial markets globally, leading to a continued economic downturn, which is expected to decrease spending generally and could adversely affect demand for our products. It is not possible at this time to estimate the full impact that COVID-19 will have on our business, as the impact will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. Moreover, to the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects our business, financial condition, and results of operations, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this Risk Factors section, including but not limited to, those related to our ability to increase sales to existing and new customers, continue to perform on existing contracts, develop and deploy new technologies, expand our marketing capabilities and sales organization, and to generate sufficient cash flow to operate our business and meet our obligations. 8 Table of Contents Investment Risks : Our issuance of additional shares may have the effect of diluting the interest of shareholders; our common stock shareholders do not have pre-emptive rights . Any additional issuances of common stock by us from our authorized but unissued shares may have the effect of diluting the percentage interest of existing shareholders. The securities issued to raise funds may have rights, preferences, or privileges that are senior to those of the holders of our other securities, including our common stock. The board of directors has the power to issue such shares without shareholder approval. We fully intend to issue additional common shares in order to raise capital to fund our business operations and growth objectives. We do not anticipate paying dividends to our common stockholders in the foreseeable future, which makes investment in our stock speculative and risky . We have not paid dividends on our common stock and do not anticipate paying dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. The board of directors has sole authority to declare dividends payable to our stockholders. The fact that we have not paid and do not plan to pay dividends indicates that we must use all of our funds we generate for reinvestment in our business activities. Investors also must evaluate an investment in the Company solely on the basis of anticipated capital gains. Limited liability of our executive officers and directors may discourage shareholders from bringing a lawsuit against them . Our Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws contain provisions that limit the liability of our directors for monetary damages and provide for indemnification of officers and directors. These provisions may discourage shareholders from bringing a lawsuit against officers and directors for breaches of fiduciary duty and may reduce the likelihood of derivative litigation against officers and directors even though such action, if successful, might otherwise have benefited the shareholders. In addition, a shareholder s investment in the Company may be adversely affected to the extent that we pay costs of settlement and damage awards against officers or directors pursuant to the indemnification provisions of the bylaw. The impact on a shareholder s investment in terms of the cost of defending a lawsuit may deter the shareholder from bringing suit against any of our officers or directors. We have been advised that the SEC takes the position that these article and bylaw provisions do not affect the liability of any director under applicable federal and state securities laws. We are a development stage company and we expect to incur operating losses for the foreseeable future. We were incorporated on June 12, 2008 and our business to date has been principally organizational activities. We have no way to evaluate the likelihood that our business will be successful. Potential investors should be aware of the difficulties normally encountered by start-up companies and the high rate of failure of such enterprises. The likelihood of success must be considered in light of the problems, expenses, difficulties, complications and delays encountered in connection with the business that we plan to undertake. These potential problems include, but are not limited to, additional costs and expenses that may exceed current estimates. We anticipate that we will incur increased operating expenses without realizing any revenues. We recognize that if business revenues are not forthcoming, we will not be able to continue business operations. There is no history upon which to base any assumption as to the likelihood that we will prove successful, and if we are unsuccessful in addressing these risks, our business will most likely fail. We have yet to earn continuous or sufficient revenue and our ability to sustain our operations is dependent on our ability to raise additional financing. There is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. We have accumulated net losses of 58,885,730 to July 31, 2021 and have not generated any material revenues to date. Our future is dependent upon our ability to obtain financing and upon future profitable operations from the development of our business. These factors raise substantial doubt that we will be able to continue as a going concern. Our independent auditor has expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. This opinion could materially limit our ability to raise additional funds by issuing new debt or equity securities or otherwise. If we fail to raise sufficient capital when needed, we will not be able to complete our business plan. We may have to liquidate our business and you may lose your investment. You should consider our auditor s comments when determining if an investment in our company is suitable. 9 Table of Contents We may be unable to obtain additional capital that we may require to implement our business plan. This would restrict our ability to grow. The proceeds from our financing efforts to date have provided us with a limited amount of working capital not sufficient to fund our proposed operations. We will require additional capital to continue to operate our business and our proposed operations. We may be unable to obtain additional capital as and when required. Future acquisitions and future development, production and marketing activities, as well as our administrative requirements (such as salaries, insurance expenses and general overhead expenses, as well as legal compliance costs and accounting expenses) will require a substantial amount of additional capital and cash flow. We may not be successful in locating suitable financing transactions in the time period required or at all, and we may not obtain the capital we require by other means. If we do not succeed in raising additional capital, the capital we have received to date is not sufficient to fund our operations going forward without obtaining additional capital financing. Any additional capital raised through the sale of equity may dilute your ownership percentage. This could result in a decrease in the fair market value of our equity securities because our assets would be owned by a larger pool of outstanding equity. The terms of securities we issue in future may be more favorable to our new investors, and may include preferences, superior voting rights and the issuance of warrants or other derivative securities, and issuances of incentive awards under equity employee incentive plans, which may have a further dilutive effect. Our ability to obtain needed financing may be impaired by such factors as the capital markets generally, our status as a new enterprise without a demonstrated operating history or the retention or loss of key management. If the amount of capital we are able to raise from financing activities is not sufficient to satisfy our capital needs, we may be required to cease our operations. We may incur substantial costs in pursuing future capital financing, including investment banking fees, legal fees, accounting fees, securities law compliance fees, printing and distribution expenses and other costs. We may also be required to recognize non-cash expenses in connection with certain securities we may issue, such as convertible notes and warrants, which may adversely impact our financial condition. The limited trading of our common stock may impair your ability to sell your shares. There has been a limited trading market for our common stock since our inception. The lack of trading of our common stock and the low volume of any future trading may impair your ability to sell your shares at the time you wish to sell them or at a price that you consider reasonable. Such factors may also impair our ability to raise capital by selling shares of capital stock and may impair our ability to acquire other companies or technologies by using common stock as consideration. The market price of our common stock is likely to be highly volatile and subject to wide fluctuations. Assuming we are able to establish an active trading market for our common stock, the market price of our common stock is likely to be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to a number of factors that are beyond our control, including: dilution caused by our issuance of additional shares of common stock and other forms of equity securities, which we expect to make in connection with future capital financings to fund our operations and growth, to attract and retain valuable personnel and in connection with future strategic partnerships with other companies; announcements of acquisitions or other business initiatives by our competitors; market changes in the demand for products and services; quarterly variations in our revenues and operating expenses; changes in the valuation of similarly situated companies, both in our industry and in other industries; changes in analysts estimates affecting us, our competitors or our industry; additions and departures of key personnel; fluctuations in interest rates and the availability of capital in the capital markets; 10 Table of Contents These and other factors are largely beyond our control, and the impact of these risks, singly or in the aggregate, may result in material adverse changes to the market price of our common stock and our results of operations and financial condition. Our operating results may fluctuate significantly, and these fluctuations may cause our stock price to decline. Our operating results will likely vary in the future primarily as the result of fluctuations in our revenues and operating expenses, costs that we incur, and other factors. If our results of operations do not meet the expectations of current or potential investors, the price of our common stock may decline. Applicable SEC rules governing the trading of penny stocks will limit the trading and liquidity of our common stock, which may affect the trading price of our common stock. Our common stock is presently considered to be a penny stock and is subject to SEC rules and regulations which impose limitations upon the manner in which such shares may be publicly traded and which regulate broker-dealer practices in connection with transactions in penny stocks. Penny stocks generally are equity securities with a price of less than 5.00 (other than securities registered on certain national securities exchanges or quoted on the FINRA system, provided that current price and volume information with respect to transactions in such securities is provided by the exchange or system). The penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from the rules, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document that provides information about penny stocks and the risks in the penny stock market. The broker-dealer must also provide the customer with current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock, the compensation of the broker-dealer and its salesperson in the transaction, and monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer s account. In addition, the penny stock rules generally require that prior to a transaction in a penny stock, the broker-dealer make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser s written agreement to the transaction. These disclosure requirements may have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity in the secondary market for a stock that becomes subject to the penny stock rules which may increase the difficulty investors may experience in attempting to liquidate such securities.

You should not place too much reliance on these forward-looking statements.

Net Loss We incurred net losses of 8,391,343 and 7,728,245 for the years ended July 31, 2021 and 20, respectively. These losses were the result of the revenues and expenses described above. Our auditors have issued a going concern opinion as at July 31, 2021. This means that there is substantial doubt that we can continue as an on-going business for the next twelve months unless we obtain additional capital to pay our bills. This is because we have generated minimal revenue. There is no assurance we will ever generate significant revenue.

If we fail to raise sufficient capital when needed, we will not be able to complete our business plan. The future of our Company is dependent upon its ability to obtain financing and upon future profitable operations from the development of acquisitions. We estimate that our expenses over the next 12 months will be approximately 2,600,000, comprised of 2,400,000 in operating expenses and 200,000 in investing activities. These estimates may change significantly depending on the performance of our products in the marketplace and our ability to raise capital from shareholders or other sources. We intend to meet our cash requirements for the next 12 months through a combination of debt financing and equity financing by way of private placements. We currently do not have any arrangements in place to complete any private placement financings and there is no assurance that we will be successful in completing any private placement financings on terms that will be acceptable to us. We may not raise sufficient funds to fully carry out our business plan. Effective December 19, 2019, we entered into a securities purchase agreement dated as of December 19, 2019 (the SPA with Triton Funds, LP, an accredited investor (the Buyer ), pursuant to which the Company issued and sold to the Buyer (i) a convertible promissory note (the Note in the aggregate principal amount of up to 750,000, due June 30, 2020, bearing interest at a rate of ten percent (10 per annum and convertible into shares of the Company s common stock at a conversion price of 2.50 per share and (ii) a common stock purchase warrant (the Warrant ), exercisable for two (2) years, to purchase up to 250,000 shares of the Company s common stock at an exercise price of 3.00 per share, for an aggregate purchase price of 600,000. The Note can be prepaid at any time by paying 110 of the then outstanding principal, interest, default interest (if any), and any other amounts then due under the Note. The Note is initially convertible at a price per share equal to 2.50 (the Fixed Conversion Price provided, however, that during the continuance of an event of default under the Note, the conversion price shall be equal to 75 of the lowest trading price of the Company s common stock during the 30 trading days prior to conversion. 22 Table of Contents On December 31, 2019, Triton paid an initial purchase price of 100,000 at the initial closing. The Company received net proceeds of 85,000 after paying fees of 15,000. On February 20, 2020, Triton paid the purchase price balance of 500,000. During the year ended July 31, 2020, the Company made a cash payment of 250,000 on the debt and Triton converted 328,786 of the debt into 1,234,946 shares of common stock pursuant to the terms of the agreement. Concurrently therewith, we entered into a registration rights agreement with the Buyer, pursuant to which we agreed to file a registration statement with the SEC for the registration of the secondary offering and resale of the shares issuable upon conversion of the Note and exercise of the Warrant and to have the registration statement declared effective by the SEC at the earliest possible date. The registration was declared effective by the SEC on February 11, 2020. The Buyer paid the purchase balance, and the Note and Warrant fully vested, on February 20, 2020. On March 31, 2020, we and Triton entered into a Modification Agreement, pursuant to which (i) we paid 250,000 of the principal amount of the Note, bringing the principal balance of the Note to 500,000, (ii) the maturity date of the Note was extended to August 20, 2020, (iii) the conversion price of the Note was established as 75 of the lowest trading price of our common stock during the 30 trading days prior to conversion, and (iv) the minimum volume weighted price requirement of the Note was deleted. On August 19, 2020, the Company paid the remaining principal and accrued and unpaid interest in the aggregate of 200,000 and as of that date the note balance is -0-. On April 30, 2020, we received loan proceeds in the amount of 444,850 under the Paycheck Protection Program PPP ). The PPP, established as part of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act CARES Act ), provides for loans to qualifying businesses for amounts up to 2.5 times of the average monthly payroll expenses of the qualifying business. The loans and accrued interest are forgivable after eight weeks as long as the borrower uses the loan proceeds for eligible purposes, including payroll, benefits, rent and utilities, and maintains its payroll levels. The amount of loan forgiveness will be reduced if the borrower terminates employees or reduces salaries during the eight-week period. The unforgiven portion of the PPP loan is payable over two years at an interest rate of 1 , with a deferral of payments for the first six months. We intend to use the proceeds for purposes consistent with the PPP. While we currently believe that our use of the loan proceeds will meet the conditions for forgiveness of the loan, we cannot assure you that we will not take actions that could cause us to be ineligible for forgiveness of the loan, in whole or in part. We may rely on equity sales of our common stock in order to fund our business operations. Issuances of additional shares will result in dilution to our existing stockholders. There is no assurance that we will achieve any additional sales of our equity securities or arrange for debt or other financing to fund our planned business activities. The Company entered into an Equity Financing Agreement (the Financing Agreement dated as of September 13, 2020 with GHS Investments, LLC GHS for an equity line. Although we are not required to sell shares under the Financing Agreement, the Financing Agreement gives us the option to sell to GHS up to 25,000,000 worth of our common stock, in increments, over the period ending on the earlier of (i) the date GHS has purchased an aggregate of 25,000,000 of our common stock pursuant to the Financing Agreement, or (ii) the date that the registration statement for the registration of the secondary offering and resale of the shares to be acquired by GHS pursuant to the Financing Agreement is no longer in effect (the Open Period ). Concurrently with the execution of the Financing Agreement, the Company issued to GHS 150,857 restricted shares of its Common stock Commitment Shares to offset transaction costs.

After the Initial Term, the term of the Placement Agreement will automatically be extended for additional successive one (1) year periods unless either party provides written notice to the other party of its intent not to so extend the term at least thirty (30) days before the expiration of the then current term. Under the terms of the Placement Agreement, the Company has agreed to issue to BSL an advisory fee of two hundred fifty thousand (250,000) common stock shares with an issuance date of the Effective Date. Critical Accounting Policies Use of Estimates The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Our Company regularly evaluates estimates and assumptions related to deferred income tax asset valuation allowances. Our Company bases its estimates and assumptions on current facts, historical experience and various other factors that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the accrual of costs and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. The actual results experienced by our Company may differ materially and adversely from our Company s estimates. To the extent there are material differences between the estimates and the actual results, future results of operations will be affected. Cash and Cash Equivalents The Company considers all highly liquid instruments with maturity of three months or less at the time of issuance and trust funds to be cash equivalents. Inventory Inventory is carried at the lower of cost or net realizable value, with the cost being determined on a first-in, first-out (FIFO) basis. The Company periodically reviews physical inventory and will record a reserve for excess and/or obsolete inventory if necessary. During the years ended July 31, 2021, and 2020, inventory of 953,402 and 306,450, respectively, was fully impaired due to the research and development nature of the current inventory for the year ended July 31, 2021, and unfavorable weather conditions for the year ended July 31, 2020. In the early growing stages, the plants were severely damaged by a sand storm and could not be salvaged. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets The Company evaluates the recoverability of its fixed assets and other assets in accordance with ASC 360-10- 15, Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets . Impairment of long-lived assets is recognized when the net book value of such assets exceeds their expected cash flows, in which case the assets are written down to fair value, which is determined based on discounted future cash flows or appraised values. Related Party Transactions The Company follows ASC 850, Related Party Disclosures , for the identification of related parties and disclosure of related party transactions. In accordance with ASC 850, the Company s financial statements include disclosures of material related party transactions, other than compensation arrangements, expense allowances, and other similar items in the ordinary course of business, as well as transactions that are eliminated in the preparation of financial statements. 24 Table of Contents Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method in accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes . The asset and liability method provides that deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized. Foreign Currency Translation The Company s functional and reporting currency is the U.S. dollar. Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into the currency of measurement at the exchange rates in effect on the transaction date. Monetary balance sheet items expressed in foreign currencies are translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date. The resulting exchange gains and losses are recognized in the statement of operations. Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measures ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures , requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. ASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy based on the level of independent, objective evidence surrounding the inputs used to measure fair value. A financial instrument s categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. ASC 820 prioritizes the inputs into three levels that may be used to measure fair value: Level 1 Level 1 applies to assets or liabilities for which there are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 Level 2 applies to assets or liabilities for which there are inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets with insufficient volume or infrequent transactions (less active markets); or model-derived valuations in which significant inputs are observable or can be derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data. Level 3 Level 3 applies to assets or liabilities for which there are unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of the fair value of the assets or liabilities. The Company s financial instruments consist principally of cash, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, loans payable, and amounts due to related parties. Pursuant to ASC 820, the fair value of cash is determined based on Level 1 inputs, which consist of quoted prices in active markets for identical assets. The recorded values of all other financial instruments approximate their current fair values because of their nature and respective maturity dates or durations. Stock-based Compensation The Company records stock-based compensation in accordance with ASC 718, Compensation Stock Compensation and ASC 505, Equity Based Payments to Non-Employees , using the fair value method. All transactions in which goods or services are the consideration received for the issuance of equity instruments are accounted for based on the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instrument issued, whichever is more reliably measurable. 25 Table of Contents Loss Per Share The Company computes earnings (loss) per share in accordance with ASC 260, Earnings per Share . ASC 260 requires presentation of both basic and diluted earnings per share EPS on the face of the income statement. Basic EPS is computed by dividing earnings (loss) available to common shareholders (numerator) by the weighted average number of shares outstanding (denominator) during the period. Diluted EPS gives effect to all dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method and convertible preferred stock using the if-converted method. In computing diluted EPS, the average stock price for the period is used in determining the number of shares assumed to be purchased from the exercise of stock options or warrants. Diluted EPS excludes all dilutive potential shares if their effect is anti-dilutive. As of July 31, 2021, and 2020, the Company does not have any potentially dilutive shares. Comprehensive Loss ASC 220, Comprehensive Income , establishes standards for the reporting and display of comprehensive loss and its components in the financial statements. Recent Accounting Pronouncements The Company has implemented all new accounting pronouncements that are in effect. These pronouncements did not have any material impact on the financial statements unless otherwise disclosed, and the Company does not believe that there are any other new accounting pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors. 26 Table of Contents Item 8.

As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit Matters The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. As discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, the Company had a going concern due to a continual net loss, stockholders deficiency and cash used in operations. Auditing management s evaluation of a going concern can be a significant judgment given the fact that the Company uses management estimates on future revenues and expenses which are not able to be substantiated. To evaluate the appropriateness of the going concern, we examined and evaluate the financial information that was the initial cause along with management s plans to mitigate the going concern and management s disclosure on going concern. /s/ M K CPAS, PLLC We have served as the Company s auditor since 2012.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements July 31, 2021 (Expressed in U.S. dollars) (Unaudited) 1. Nature of Operations and Continuance of Business Green Hygienics Holdings Inc. (the Company was incorporated in the State of Nevada on June 12, 2008 as Silver Bay Resources, Inc. On June 30, 2010, the name was changed to Takedown Entertainment Inc. On July 24, 2012, the Company changed its name to Green Hygienics Holdings Inc. The Company is an innovative, full-scope, science-driven, premium hemp cultivation and branding enterprise focused on the cultivation and processing of industrial hemp for cannabidiol CBD ). The Hemp Farming Act of 2018 removed hemp from Schedule I controlled substances (defined as cannabis with less than 0.3 THC), making it an ordinary agricultural commodity. The Company s business model includes generating revenues from the sale of hemp and premium-grade CBD products, creating trusted global consumer brands, developing valuable Intellectual Property, and growing the Company rapidly through strategic acquisitions. With direct regard to acquisitions, the Company acts as a business accelerator and a vertical integrator focusing to support rapid growth and development of companies with extraordinary potential. A novel strain of coronavirus COVID-19 continues to spread and severely impact the economy of the United States and other countries around the world. Federal, state, and local governmental policies and initiatives designed to reduce the transmission of COVID-19 have resulted in, among other things, matters related to our ability to increase sales to existing and new customers, continue to perform on existing contracts, develop and deploy new technologies, expand our marketing capabilities and sales organization, the adoption of work-from-home or shelter-in-place policies. and to generate sufficient cash flow to operate our business and meet our obligations. The COVID-19 impact on the Company s operations is consistent with the overall industry and publicly issued statements from competitors, partners, and vendors. More generally, the COVID-19 pandemic has and is expected to continue to adversely affect economies and financial markets globally, leading to a continued economic downturn, which is expected to decrease spending generally and could adversely affect demand for our products. It is not possible at this time to estimate the full impact that COVID-19 will have on our business, as the impact will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. The extent to which our businesses may be affected by the COVID-19 pandemic will largely depend on both current and future developments, including its duration, spread, and treatment, including vaccines in various stages of development and federal approval, and related work and travel advisories and restrictions, all of which are highly uncertain and cannot be reasonably predicted at this time. 2. Going Concern and Management s Plans Going Concern These consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which implies the Company will continue to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business. The continuation of the Company as a going concern is dependent upon the continued financial support from its shareholders, the ability of the Company to obtain necessary equity financing to continue operations, and the attainment of profitable operations. As of July 31, 2021, the Company has a working capital deficiency of 7,825,264, and has incurred losses of 8,391,343 and 7,728,245 for the years ended July 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and has an accumulated deficit of 58,885,730 since inception. These factors raise substantial doubt regarding the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. These financial statements do not include any adjustments to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. F-7 Table of Contents Management s Plans As discussed in Note 1, the Company business model includes generating revenues from the sale of hemp and premium-grade CBD products, creating trusted global consumer brands, developing valuable Intellectual Property, and growing the Company rapidly through strategic acquisitions. Recent events in the execution of this plan include: On February 24, 2021, TruLife Labs LLC TLL and TruLife Biotech LLC TLB were formed and Articles of Organization with the State of California were filed. The Company is the sole member of TLL and TLB and Mr. Loudoun is the Manager of both. On March 2, 2021, the Company entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the Primordia APA with Primordia, LLC Primordia ), a Nevada limited liability company (see Note 12). On March 15, 2021, the Company entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the Castillo APA with Castillo Seed L.L.C. Castillo ), a Puerto Rico limited liability company (see Note 12). On April 14, 2021, the Company entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the Admay APA with Admay, Inc Admay ), a Wyoming company. On February 15, 2021, the Company engaged (the Engagement Agreement ), Trimark Capital Partners Trimark ), a Grand Cayman company to provide agent services for the sale and issuance of up to 100 million in a series of bonds. Any proceeds will be used to acquire real estate assets and advance the company s business development plans. 3. Significant Accounting Policies (a) Basis of Presentation These financial statements and related notes are presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and are expressed in U.S. dollars. Certain amounts from the July 31, 2020 annual report have been reclassified to conform to the presentation used in the current period. (b) Principles of Consolidation These financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries. Subsidiaries are all entities (including structured entities) which the Company controls. For accounting purposes, control is established by an investor when it is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. All inter-company balances and transactions are eliminated. (c) Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses in the reporting period. The Company regularly evaluates estimates and assumptions related to deferred income tax asset valuation allowances. The Company bases its estimates and assumptions on current facts, historical experience and various other factors that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the accrual of costs and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. The actual results experienced by the Company may differ materially and adversely from the Company s estimates. To the extent there are material differences between the estimates and the actual results, future results of operations will be affected. F-8 Table of Contents (d) Cash and Cash Equivalents The Company considers all highly liquid instruments with maturity of three months or less at the time of issuance and trust funds to be cash equivalents. (e) Inventory Inventory is carried at the lower of cost or net realizable value, with the cost being determined on a first-in, first-out (FIFO) basis. The Company periodically reviews physical inventory and will record a reserve for excess and/or obsolete inventory if necessary. In July 2020, the Company planted its first large scale hemp crops for cultivation. The planting covers approximately 120 acres of land. During the year ended July 31, 2021, the Company purchased additional seeds and nutrients to plant and to be later transferred into the fields. These costs included approximately 79,000 for seeds and nutrients and 654,000 on labor to prepare the fields, plant seeds, and to begin harvesting. The Company has determined to record these costs as expenses due to the research and development nature of the current inventory for the year ended July 31, 2021. Additionally, included in research and developments was the inventory of 69,600 acquired from Castillo and the Company recorded inventory impairment of 172,400 related to the hemp cigarettes acquired in the Admay transaction. (f) Intangible Assets During the year ended July 31, 2021, the Company acquired trademarks of 25,000 for the American Hemp and Diablo trademarks (see Note 2). In accordance with ASC 350, Intangibles Goodwill and Other, goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are no longer subject to amortization but are tested for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. (g) Related Party Transactions The Company follows ASC 850, Related Party Disclosures , for the identification of related parties and disclosure of related party transactions. In accordance with ASC 850, the Company s financial statements include disclosures of material related party transactions, other than compensation arrangements, expense allowances, and other similar items in the ordinary course of business, as well as transactions that are eliminated in the preparation of financial statements. (h) Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method in accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes . The asset and liability method provides that deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized. (i) Foreign Currency Translation The Company s functional and reporting currency is the U.S. dollar. Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into the currency of measurement at the exchange rates in effect on the transaction date. Monetary balance sheet items expressed in foreign currencies are translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date. The resulting exchange gains and losses are recognized in the statement of operations. (j) Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measures F-9 Table of Contents Level 1 Level 1 applies to assets or liabilities for which there are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 Level 2 applies to assets or liabilities for which there are inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets with insufficient volume or infrequent transactions (less active markets), or model-derived valuations in which significant inputs are observable or can be derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data. Level 3 Level 3 applies to assets or liabilities for which there are unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of the fair value of the assets or liabilities. The Company s financial instruments consist principally of cash, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, loans payable, and amounts due to related parties. Pursuant to ASC 820, the fair value of cash is determined based on Level 1 inputs, which consist of quoted prices in active markets for identical assets. The recorded values of all other financial instruments approximate their current fair values because of their nature and respective maturity dates or durations. (k) Stock-based Compensation The Company records stock-based compensation in accordance with ASC 718, Compensation Stock Compensation and ASC 505, Equity Based Payments to Non-Employees , using the fair value method. All transactions in which goods or services are the consideration received for the issuance of equity instruments are accounted for based on the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instrument issued, whichever is more reliably measurable. (l) Revenue and Deferred Revenue In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) which amended the existing accounting standards for revenue recognition. ASU 2014-09 establishes principles for recognizing revenue upon the transfer of promised goods or services to customers, in an amount that reflects the expected consideration received in exchange for those goods or services. As of the date of this report, the Company has not recognized any revenue related to the hemp production business. For the year ended July 31, 2021, revenue recognized of 40,954 is related to the land use rental income from San Diego Gas and Electric Company SDGE ). SDGE vacated the property in October 2020. As of July 31, 2020, the Company recorded deferred revenue of 15,973, representing a portion of the payment received in July 2020, that pertains to August 2020 rental income and accordingly has been recognized and is included in the revenue for the year ended July 31, 2021. (m) Leases The Company evaluates lease assets and lease liabilities, (if any), pursuant to ASC 842, by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing transactions. As of the date of this report, the Company has no material transactions to report. (n) Loss Per Share The Company computes earnings (loss) per share in accordance with ASC 260, Earnings per Share . ASC 260 requires presentation of both basic and diluted earnings per share EPS on the face of the income statement. Basic EPS is computed by dividing earnings (loss) available to common shareholders (numerator) by the weighted average number of shares outstanding (denominator) during the period. Diluted EPS gives effect to all dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method and convertible preferred stock using the if-converted method. In computing diluted EPS, the average stock price for the period is used in determining the number of shares assumed to be purchased from the exercise of stock options or warrants. Diluted EPS excludes all dilutive potential shares if their effect is anti-dilutive. As of July 31, 2021, the Company does not have any potentially dilutive shares. F-10 Table of Contents (o) Comprehensive Loss ASC 220, Comprehensive Income , establishes standards for the reporting and display of comprehensive loss and its components in the financial statements. (p) Recent Accounting Pronouncements In July 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-10, Codification Improvements to Topic 842, Leases. The amendments in ASU 2018-10 provide additional clarification and implementation guidance on certain aspects of the previously issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) ASU 2016-02 and have the same effective and transition requirements as ASU 2016-02. Upon the effective date, ASU 2018-10 will supersede the current lease guidance in ASC Topic 840, Leases. Under the new guidance, lessees will be required to recognize for all leases, with the exception of short-term leases, a lease liability, which is a lessee s obligation to make lease payments arising from a lease, measured on a discounted basis. Concurrently, lessees will be required to recognize a right-of-use asset, which is an asset that represents the lessee s right to use, or control the use of, a specified asset for the lease term. ASU 2018-10 is effective for private companies and emerging growth public companies for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted. The guidance is required to be applied using a modified retrospective transition approach for leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative periods presented in the financial statements. During the year ended July 31, 2021, the Company assessed the impact this guidance had on its financial statements and concluded that at present ASU No. 2018-10 has no impact on its financial statements. 4. Fixed Assets Fixed assets are recorded at cost reduced by accumulated depreciation. Depreciation expense is recognized over the assets estimated useful lives using the straight-line method. Estimated useful lives are periodically reviewed and, when appropriate, changes are made prospectively. When certain events or changes in operating conditions occur, asset lives may be adjusted and an impairment assessment may be performed on the recoverability of the carrying amounts. The Company has determined to record all of the assets acquired in the Primordia APA as an asset cluster and has classified 431,137 as fixed assets. Fixed assets consist of the following: Useful Life Balance at July 31, 2020 Additions Accumulated Depreciation Balance at July 31, 2021 Production equipment 5 years 359,909 708,265 (213,275 854,899 Furniture and office equipment 5 years 8,102 - (3,243 4,859 Buildings and improvements 15 years 225,167 261,802 (36,763 450,206 Land 4,212,362 - - 4,212,362 4,805,540 970,067 (253,281 5,522,326 The balance as of July 31, 2020 in the above table is the costs of the fixed assets. As of July 31, 2020, accumulated depreciation was 78,076 and the net fixed asset balance as of July 31, 2020 was 4,727,464. Fixed asset costs are being depreciated using the straight-line method based on the useful life of the asset. Depreciation expenses was 175,204 and 78,076 for the years ended July 31, 2021, and 2020, respectively. F-11 Table of Contents 5.

On April 30, 2020 the Company received loan proceeds in the amount of 444,850 under the Paycheck Protection Program PPP ). The PPP, established as part of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (the CARES Act ), provides for loans to qualifying businesses for amounts up to 2.5 times of the average monthly payroll expenses of the qualifying business.

F-25 Table of Contents Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Financial Disclosure None. Item 9A. Controls and Procedures Management s Report on Disclosure Controls and Procedures Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f)). The Company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Under the supervision and with the participation of management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the Company conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of July 31, 2020 using the criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO ). A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. In its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of July 31, 2021, the Company determined that there were control deficiencies that constituted material weaknesses, as described below. 1. We do not have an Audit Committee While not being legally obligated to have an audit committee, it is the management s view that such a committee, including a financial expert member, is an utmost important entity level control over the Company s financial statement. Currently, the Board of Directors acts in the capacity of the Audit Committee and does not include a member that is considered to be independent of management to provide the necessary oversight over management s activities. 2. We did not maintain appropriate cash controls As of July 31, 2021, the Company has not maintained sufficient internal controls over financial reporting for the cash process, including failure to segregate cash handling and accounting functions, and did not require dual signature on the Company s bank accounts. 3. We did not implement appropriate information technology controls As at July 31, 2021, the Company retains copies of all financial data and material agreements; however, there is no formal procedure or evidence of normal backup of the Company s data or off-site storage of data in the event of theft, misplacement, or loss due to unmitigated factors. 4. The Company has no formal control process related to the identification and approval of related party transactions. Accordingly, the Company concluded that these control deficiencies resulted in a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by the Company s internal controls. As a result of the material weaknesses described above, management has concluded that the Company did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of July 31, 2021 based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by COSO. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with our evaluation we conducted of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of July 31, 2021, that occurred during our fourth fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. This annual report does not include an attestation report of the Company s registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management s report was not subject to attestation by the Company s registered public accounting firm pursuant to temporary rules of the SEC that permit the Company to provide only management s report in this annual report. 27 Table of Contents PART III Item 10.

Halamuda brings a wealth of industry and management experience; his knowledge and expertise at scaling businesses will be a key component as he leads the growth of GRYN s Agriculture Division. John Gildea Senior Vice President, Corporate Development Mr. Gildea has served as our Senior Vice President, Corporate Development, since November 15, 2019. Mr. Gildea has more than 20 years of experience in the public and private markets. His expertise includes structuring, negotiating and effecting private and public financings and mergers and acquisitions, as well as marketing, public and investor relations. Through the course of his career, Gildea established a trusted and extensive network of equity and capital partners, with whom he has maintained successful and proven relationships over the years, resulting in multiple uplistings to higher exchanges and capital raises. Director Qualifications We considered Mr. Loudoun s prior experience as a successful business strategist and in real estate, including his prior experience with Archer Cleantech, Inc., other renewable project opportunities, as well as experience with other start-up businesses and real estate development as important factors in concluding that he was qualified to serve as one of our directors. 29 Table of Contents Term of Office Our directors are appointed to hold office until the next annual meeting of our stockholders or until a successor is qualified and elected, or until he resigns or is removed in accordance with the provisions of the State of Nevada Statutes. Our officers are appointed by our Board of Directors and hold office until removed by the Board. Family Relationships None Involvement in Certain Legal Proceedings No director, executive officer, significant employee or control person of the Company has been involved in any legal proceeding listed in Item 401(f) of Regulation S-K in the past 10 years. Advisory Boards The Company has established scientific, financial and general advisory boards, each comprised of experienced industry specific individuals. They are posted on the corporate website: https://www.greenhygienics.com/about-us/leadership/ Significant Employees We have no significant employees other than our officers and/or directors. Our officers and directors have not been the subject of any order, judgment, or decree of any court of competent jurisdiction, or any regulatory agency permanently or temporarily enjoining, barring, suspending or otherwise limiting them from acting as an investment advisor, underwriter, broker or dealer in the securities industry, or as an affiliated person, director or employee of an investment company, bank, savings and loan association, or insurance company or from engaging in or continuing any conduct or practice in connection with any such activity or in connection with the purchase or sale of any securities. Our officers and directors have not been convicted in any criminal proceeding (excluding traffic violations) nor are they subject of any currently pending criminal proceeding. We conduct our business through agreements with consultants and arms-length third parties. We pay our consultants usual and customary rates received by other third parties for performing similar consulting services. Code of Ethics Our board of directors adopted our code of ethical conduct that applies to all of our employees and directors, including our principal executive officer, principal financial officer, principal accounting officer or controller, and persons performing similar functions. We believe the adoption of our Code of Ethical Conduct is consistent with the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Our Code of Ethical Conduct is designed to deter wrongdoing and to promote: Honest and ethical conduct, including the ethical handling of actual or apparent conflicts of interest between personal and professional relationships; Full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in reports and documents that we file or submit to the Securities Exchange Commission and in other public communications made by us; Compliance with applicable governmental laws, rules and regulations; The prompt internal reporting to an appropriate person or persons identified in the code of violations of our Code of Ethical Conduct; and Accountability for adherence to the Code. 30 Table of Contents Director Independence None of the members of our Board of Directors qualifies as an independent director in accordance with the published listing requirements of the NASDAQ Global Market. The NASDAQ independence definition includes a series of objective tests, such as that the director is not, and has not been for at least three years, one of our employees and that neither the director, nor any of his family members has engaged in various types of business dealings with us. In addition, our Board has not made a subjective determination as to each director that no relationships exist which, in the opinion of our Board, would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director, though such subjective determination is required by the NASDAQ rules. Had our Board of Directors made these determinations, our Board would have reviewed and discussed information provided by the directors and us with regard to each director s business and personal activities and relationships as they may relate to us and our management. In performing the functions of the audit committee, our board oversees our accounting and financial reporting process. In this function, our board performs several functions. Our board, among other duties, evaluates and assesses the qualifications of the Company s independent auditors; determines whether to retain or terminate the existing independent auditors; meets with the independent auditors and financial management of the Company to review the scope of the proposed audit and audit procedures on an annual basis; reviews and approves the retention of independent auditors for any non-audit services; reviews the independence of the independent auditors; reviews with the independent auditors and with the Company s financial accounting personnel the adequacy and effectiveness of accounting and financial controls and considers recommendations for improvement of such controls; reviews the financial statements to be included in our annual and quarterly reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission; and discusses with the Company s management and the independent auditors the results of the annual audit and the results of our quarterly financial statements. Our board as a whole will consider executive officer compensation, and our entire board participates in the consideration of director compensation. Our board as a whole oversees our compensation policies, plans and programs, reviews and approves corporate performance goals and objectives relevant to the compensation of our executive officers, if any, and administers our equity incentive and stock option plans, if any. Each of our directors participates in the consideration of director nominees. In addition to nominees recommended by directors, our board will consider nominees recommended by shareholders if submitted in writing to our secretary. Our board believes that any candidate for director, whether recommended by shareholders or by the board, should be considered on the basis of all factors relevant to our needs and the credentials of the candidate at the time the candidate is proposed. Such factors include relevant business and industry experience and demonstrated character and judgment. Compliance with Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 requires the Company s directors and executive officers, persons who beneficially own more than 10 of a registered class of the Company s equity securities, and certain other persons to file reports of ownership and changes in ownership on Forms 3, 4 and 5 with the SEC, and to furnish the Company with copies of the forms. Based solely on its review of the forms it received, or written representations from reporting persons, the Company believes that all of its directors, executive officers and greater than 10 beneficial owners complied with all such filing requirements during the fiscal year ended July 31, 2021. Item 11.

Except in cases where community property laws apply or as indicated in the footnotes to this table, we believe that each stockholder identified in the table possesses sole voting and investment power over all shares of common stock shown as beneficially owned by the stockholder. Shares of common stock subject to options or warrants that are currently exercisable or exercisable within 60 days of the date of this prospectus are considered outstanding and beneficially owned by the person holding the options for the purpose of computing the percentage ownership of that person but are not treated as outstanding for the purpose of computing the percentage ownership of any other person.

If a specific business opportunity becomes available, such persons may face a conflict in selecting between our business and their other business interests. In the event that a conflict of interest arises at a meeting of our directors, a director who has such a conflict will disclose his interest in a proposed transaction and will abstain from voting for or against the approval of such transaction. Item 14. Principal Accounting Fees and Services The aggregate fees billed for the most recently completed fiscal years ended July 31, 2021, and 2020, for professional services rendered by the principal accountant for the audit of our annual financial statements and review of the financial statements included in our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and services that are normally provided by the accountant in connection with statutory and regulatory filings or engagements for these fiscal periods were as follows: Year Ended July 31, 2021 July 31, 2020 Audit Fees M K 31,000 19,350 Audit Related Fees - - Tax Fees - - All Other Fees - - Total 31,000 19,350 Our board of directors pre-approves all services provided by our independent auditors. All of the above services and fees were reviewed and approved by the board of directors either before or after the respective services were rendered.
