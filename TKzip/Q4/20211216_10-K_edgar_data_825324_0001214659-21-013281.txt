ITEM 1. 
 BUSINESS 

Our Company 

Good Times Restaurants Inc., a Nevada corporation formed on
October 6, 1996, operates and franchises Bad Daddy s Burger Bar restaurants BDBB or Bad Daddy s and Good Times Burgers Frozen Custard GTBFC or Good Times restaurants. Bad Daddy s and Good
Times are two distinctly different, yet complementary, restaurant concepts. Each is positioned as a premium brand within its respective
segment of the industry. Bad Daddy s operates in the full-service dining segment as a premium burger bar concept and Good Times
operates in the quick-service restaurant segment as a high-quality drive-thru focused concept. 

Through our subsidiaries, as of December 15, 2021, we own, operate,
franchise, or license a total of forty-two Bad Daddy s restaurants in seven states. We own and operate fourteen Bad Daddy s
restaurants in North Carolina, twelve traditional Bad Daddy s restaurants in Colorado and one non-traditional unit in Colorado where
Bad Daddy s operates the kitchen for a local brewery under our brand, five in Georgia, three in South Carolina, two in Alabama,
two in Tennessee and one in Oklahoma. Of these restaurants, five restaurants are operated through joint-venture arrangements where we
are the operating partner and own between 23 and 75 interest in the joint-venture entities. We license the Bad Daddy s brand for
the Bad Daddy s restaurant located in the Charlotte Douglas International Airport which is owned and operated by a third-party licensee.
One additional Bad Daddy s restaurant in Greenville, South Carolina is operated by a third-party franchisee. 

We currently own and operate or franchise thirty-two total Good
Times restaurants. Of these restaurants, thirty are in Colorado. Two of the restaurants are in Wyoming and are dual brand 
concept restaurants operated by a franchisee of both Good Times and Taco John s. 

The terms we, us, our, 
the Company, Good Times and similar terms refer to Good Times Restaurants Inc., a Nevada corporation, and
its wholly-owned consolidated subsidiaries, including Bad Daddy s Franchise Development, LLC; Bad Daddy s International, LLC;
Good Times Drive-Thru Inc. Drive Thru and BD of Colorado, LLC. Unless otherwise indicated or the context otherwise requires,
financial and operating data in this 10-K report reflect the consolidated business and operations of Good Times Restaurants Inc. and its
subsidiaries. 

The Company s fiscal year is a 52/53-week year ending
on the last Tuesday of September. In a 52-week fiscal year, each of the Company s quarterly periods comprise 13 weeks. The additional
week in a 53-week fiscal year is added to the first quarter, making such quarter consist of 14 weeks. Fiscal year 2020 had a quarter with
14 weeks. Our discussion for fiscal years 2021 and 2020, which ended on September 28, 2021 fiscal 2021 and September 29,
2020 fiscal 2020 ), respectively, cover periods of 52 full calendar weeks in fiscal 2021 and 53 full calendar weeks in fiscal
2020. 

Fiscal 2021 Financial Brand Highlights 

Our net revenues for fiscal 2021 increased by 14,095,000 (12.8 to 123,953,000 from 109,858,000 in fiscal 2020, primarily due to the impact of our Bad Daddy s dining room closures due to the
 COVID-19 pandemic in fiscal 2020, continued strength of the Good Times brand as customers maintain a preference for drive-thru, and the
 opening of two new Bad Daddy s restaurants during fiscal 2021. 

The Bad Daddy s brand had a 18.2 increase in same store
 sales for fiscal 2021. 

The Good Times brand had a 10.5 increase in same store sales for
 fiscal 2021. 

One company-owned Good Times restaurant closed during fiscal 2021. 

We ended fiscal 2021 with 8.9 million in cash and no long-term
 debt. 

(same store sales for each brand represents the comparison
of restaurant sales in the current year, to the same comparable weeks in the immediately preceding fiscal year for those stores open for
at least 18 months). 

Recent Developments 

COVID-19 Pandemic: The global crisis resulting from the
spread of COVID-19 had a substantial impact on our restaurant operations for the fiscal years ended September 28, 2021 and September 29,
2020.

 Table of Contents 

During portions of the month of March 2020 through late May
2020, all of the Company s Bad Daddy s Burger Bar restaurants were open only for delivery and carry-out service, with dining
rooms closed by government orders. Although our dining rooms were re-opened in early June 2020, all restaurants continued to operate at
some reduction of capacity, whether driven by explicit capacity reductions under government orders, or due to social distancing protocols
that were either mandated by the same government orders or our internal protocols designed to maintain a safe foodservice environment,
both for our employees and for our customers, until May 2021. 

During portions of the month of November 2020 through early
January 2021, all of the Company s Bad Daddy s Burger Bar restaurants in Colorado were open only for limited outdoor dining,
delivery and carry-out service, with indoor dining rooms once again closed by government orders. In early January 2021, we re-opened these
dining rooms, with limited occupancy, as local regulations allowed. Our dining rooms in all other states in which Bad Daddy s has
operations were open, at reduced capacity, during this time. Presently, all of our Bad Daddy s restaurants are allowed to operate
at full capacity although staffing constraints throughout the year, primarily in the third and fourth fiscal quarters, and presently,
have caused some restaurants to operate at less than full capacity. 

Our operating results substantially depend upon our ability
to drive traffic to our restaurants, and for our Bad Daddy s Burger Bar restaurants, to serve guests in our dining rooms. We cannot
currently estimate the duration of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, including the recent acceleration of the spread
of the Delta and Omicron variants of COVID-19; neither are we able to predict how the pandemic will evolve nor how various government
entities will respond to its evolution. Should additional dining room closures occur, our business would be adversely affected. Even without
government orders, customers may choose to reduce or eliminate in-restaurant dining because of increasing numbers of COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations,
or deaths. Furthermore, although certain available vaccines may reduce the risk of further government restrictions, there is no guarantee
that the vaccine will be effective in eradicating the virus, additional mutations or variants of the virus may be resistant to any vaccine,
and the length of the ongoing pandemic may change consumer behavior such that potential customers may still choose to reduce or eliminate
in-restaurant dining. Customer and employee attitudes towards the vaccine, particularly in light of OSHA s recently released Emergency
Temporary Standard related to vaccination and testing, may impact our business, including reducing the pool of employees willing to work
and, should vaccination be required by regulation for customers to visit our restaurants, customer traffic may be negatively affected. 

Additionally, in connection with spread of COVID-19, there have
been disruptions in various food supply chains in the United States. Our operating results substantially depend upon our ability to obtain
sufficient quantities of products such as beef, bacon, and other products used in the production of items served and sold to our guests.
Ongoing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic have resulted in product shortages and could result in future product shortages and in-turn could
require us to serve a limited menu, restrict the number of items purchased per guest, or close some or all of our restaurants for an indeterminate
period of time. Ongoing material adverse impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic, including recent industry-wide labor shortages, the impact
and duration of which are uncertain, could result in reduced revenue and cash flow and could affect our assessments of impairment of intangible
assets, long-lived assets, or goodwill. 

We took extraordinary actions to increase our liquidity in response
to COVID-19 during fiscal 2020, including temporarily reducing employee pay, reductions in workforce, and obtaining Paycheck Protection
Program (the PPP loans. The PPP is sponsored by the Small Business Administration (the SBA ). The PPP is part
of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (the CARES Act ). We have since significantly increased employment
levels and restored pay to employees. We applied for full forgiveness of our PPP loans, including those of our subsidiaries, on April
30, 2020 and received confirmation of full forgiveness of all such loans during June 2021. 

We currently have a meaningful cash balance and generated significant
cash flow from operations during fiscal 2021. We used a portion of this cash balance to repurchase Company stock by means of the Tender
Offer as described below and paid down approximately 5.5 million of debt during the year. While we believe that we will continue to have
adequate working capital to meet our current needs, should business decline significantly, we would not likely choose to, and we may not
be able to, take some of the same actions as we took during fiscal 2020 to increase our liquidity as they would negatively impact the
long-term performance of the business. Furthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic is adversely affecting the availability of liquidity generally
in the credit markets, and there can be no guarantee that additional liquidity will be available on favorable terms, or at all, especially
the longer various tangential impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic last. 

Tender Offer: On August 13, 2021, the Company commenced
a tender offer (the Tender Offer to purchase up to 1,413,000 shares of its common stock at a price per share of 4.60.

Bank Cadence pursuant to which, as amended, Cadence agreed to loan the Company up to 8,000,000 with a maturity date of
January 31, 2023 (the Cadence Credit Facility ). As amended by the various amendments, the Cadence Credit Facility accrues
commitment fees on the daily unused balance of the facility at a rate of 0.25 . As of September 28, 2021, any borrowings under the Cadence
Credit Facility, as amended, bear interest at a variable rate based upon the Company s election of (i) 2.5 plus the base rate,
which is the highest of the (a) Federal Funds Rate plus 0.5 , (b) the Cadence bank publicly-announced prime rate, and (c) LIBOR plus 1.0 ,
or (ii) LIBOR, with a 0.250 floor, plus 3.5 . Interest is due at the end of each calendar quarter if the Company selects to pay interest
based on the base rate and at the end of each LIBOR period if it selects to pay interest based on LIBOR. During the fiscal year ended

The Cadence Credit Facility, as amended, contains certain affirmative
and negative covenants and events of default that the Company considers customary for an agreement of this type, including covenants setting
a maximum leverage ratio of 5.15:1, a minimum pre-distribution fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.25:1, a minimum post-distribution fixed
charge coverage ratio of 1.10:1 and minimum liquidity of 2.0 million. As of September 28, 2021, the Company was in compliance with all
financial covenants under the Cadence Credit Facility. 

As a result of entering into the Cadence Credit Facility and
the various amendments, the Company paid loan origination costs including professional fees of approximately 308,500 and is amortizing
these costs over the term of the credit agreement. 

The obligations under the Cadence Credit Facility are collateralized
by a first-priority lien on substantially all of the Company s assets. 

As of September 28, 2021, there were no outstanding borrowings
against the facility. Availability of the Cadence Credit Facility for borrowings is reduced by the outstanding face value of any letters
of credit issued under the facility. As of September 28, 2021, the outstanding face value of such letters of credit was 157,500. 

On May 7, 2020, Good Times and three of its wholly-owned subsidiaries,
BDI, Drive Thru, and BDC (each a Borrower ), entered into unsecured loans in the aggregate principal amount of 11,645,000
(the Loans with Cadence Bank, N.A. (the Lender pursuant to the PPP. 

In June 2021, the SBA approved forgiveness in full of the Loans,
including accrued interest, in the aggregate amount of 11,778,226, which was recognized as gain on debt extinguishment in the fiscal
year ended September 28, 2021. The principal and accrued interest balance on each of these Loans is now zero, as of the forgiveness date
specific to each of the Company s and its subsidiaries Loans. 

Total interest expense on notes payable and capital leases was
 269,000 and 755,000 for fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020, respectively. 

Concepts 

Bad Daddy s Burger Bar 

Bad Daddy s Burger Bar is a full-service, casual dining
small box better burger concept. Bad Daddy s currently operates all of its company-owned restaurants under a table
service / full-bar service model. 

There are three primary elements of the concept that we try
and differentiate from our competition: 

1. 
 Scratch Cooking. The menu consists of chef-inspired burgers, sandwiches, main-course salads, and appetizers
 carefully crafted in-house with high-quality ingredients to deliver bold flavor profiles along with portion sizes and presentations that
 are unrivaled in the casual dining segment of the industry. Beyond simply assembling finished ingredients on a plate, many of our sauces,
 dressings, and even our housemade American cheese are prepared from scratch in our restaurant kitchens. We offer our guests an unparalleled
 ability to customize their burgers and salads, including Create Your Own Burgers and Salads, restricted only by the ingredients available
 in the kitchen, which include a variety of different protein options including bison, turkey, chicken, salmon, and plant-based protein. 

2. 
 A Bad Ass Bar. The food menu is complemented by a full bar that focuses on local and craft beers and proprietary,
 handcrafted cocktails. Two specialties are our Bad Daddy s Amber Ale, available only at Bad Daddy s, and our Bad Ass Margarita.
 System-wide, total alcoholic beverages have historically accounted for approximately 15 of sales in our Bad Daddy s restaurants.
 As off-premises sales have increased resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, beverage sales have declined to approximately 12 of restaurant
 sales. We focus on making our bar a place where both newcomers and regular guests can comfortably relax and enjoy a beverage at happy
 hour, with their meal, or at any other time of day. 

3. 
 Genuine Hospitality. The restaurants have a high-energy yet family friendly environment with iconic pop culture
 design elements and a personal, ultra-friendly and informal service platform with a legacy of southern hospitality. Bad Daddy s
 menu, service and environment are designed around an irreverent brand personality, including unique menu items, iconic Farrah Fawcett
 and Paul Newman Cool Hand Luke posters in the men s and women s restrooms and our own playlist of classic rock and modern
 rock music that adds to the high energy atmosphere. 

While clearly available for on-premises customers, all three
of these elements are available for our off-premises guests as well, as we (1) offer the same customization on our off-premises ordering
platforms as we offer in-restaurant, (2) where allowable by state or local regulation, we also provide our alcoholic beverages in an off-premises
format for those customers who are ordering their meal for carryout or delivery, and (3) we offer the same level of hospitality to our
carry-out guests and tightly manage our delivery service providers to a similar expectation of over-the-top service. 

This brand positioning results in transactions that generate
an average per person check of approximately 32. The lunch daypart (open until 2pm) represents approximately 33 and the happy hour and
dinner dayparts (2pm until close) represent approximately 67 of restaurant sales. Off-premise sales, including take-out, delivery and
curbside pickup, accounted for approximately 33 of all system-wide sales in Fiscal 2021, an increase of 3 over Fiscal 2020 and 22 over
Fiscal 2019. This change in on-premise to off-premise sales was initially a result of COVID-19 closures and capacity reductions but we
have seen demand for off-premise sales remain strong even as customers have become more comfortable with indoor dining. Off-premise sales
average 29 per transaction while on-premise sales average 33 per transaction.

 Table of Contents 

A typical Bad Daddy s restaurant is approximately 3,500-4,000
square feet with an enclosed patio, smaller than most other chain casual dining restaurants. Fiscal 2021 average restaurant sales were
originally projected to be approximately 2.1 million per restaurant based upon historical performance with no planned new restaurant
openings, which would have resulted in average sales per square foot of approximately 552. We believe this is a key metric indicating
the strength and expansion potential of the concept. Despite COVID-19 related closures and capacity restrictions, we achieved average
annual restaurants sales of 2.4 million in Fiscal 2021, generating average sales per square foot of approximately 619 and we opened
two restaurants in the second half of fiscal 2021. 

While sharing common design elements, each restaurant has unique
features intended to represent the local trade area of each Bad Daddy s and serves as a further point of differentiation from the
larger casual dining chains. We believe Bad Daddy s innovative menu and personalized service combined with a unique, fun
restaurant design enhance our customers experience and differentiate Bad Daddy s from its competitors. 

In November 2020 the Company launched an all-new virtual brand,
Bad Mama s Chicken. This concept currently utilizes twenty-four existing Bad Daddy s Burger Bar kitchens and staff and is
available only on major third-party delivery platforms. The limited menu includes fresh jumbo chicken wings and hand-battered fresh chicken
tenders with multiple unique dipping sauces and sides including crispy tater tots, housemade potato chips and creamy, scratch-made mac
and cheese. The Company is assessing expanding the virtual concept beyond the select locations in Alabama, Colorado, Georgia, Oklahoma,
North Carolina, South Carolina and Tennessee. 

Good Times Burgers Frozen Custard 

Good Times is a drive-thru, quick-service hamburger-focused
restaurant concept offering fresh, 100 all-natural beef and chicken. We own and operate 24 Good Times restaurants, and franchise an additional
eight, located primarily in the Denver market and along the front range of Colorado. We believe Good Times was the first quick-service
chain in our region, and one of the first in the country, to offer a menu of fresh all-natural Angus beef and all-natural chicken from
animals that are humanely raised and vegetarian fed without the use of added hormones, steroids, or antibiotics. 

We compete primarily on the quality of our products, consistently
prompt service, and order accuracy. We support our quality position by using only all-natural beef and chicken. Our All Natural Frozen
Custard is made fresh throughout the day. These quality commitments help Good Times challenge quick-serve restaurant norms and match quality
found at fast casual restaurants. Our focus on speed of service keeps our customers happy as most of our sales come from the drive thru.
With menu innovation, we strive to create flavor profiles unique to Good Times. We have rotating limited time menu items and custard flavors.
Our customers appreciate that we support local causes and do not take ourselves too seriously. Good Times makes use of various media but
primarily communicate these advantages and promotions through the use of terrestrial radio and digital audio streaming. 

Our average per person check is approximately 10.50, which
we believe is lower than the average check at fast casual hamburger concepts such as Habit Burger, Five Guys, and Smashburger, but higher
than the typical quick-service restaurant average check such as McDonalds, Wendy s and Burger King. We do not offer a low-priced
value menu like most national quick-service chains, choosing to define our value proposition based on quality ingredients with a specific
focus on all-natural beef and chicken and products spanning a range of price choices within each of our menu categories. We have shifted
our focus to a blend of quality and speed while slightly reducing the number of items on the menu. 

Good Times is primarily a drive-thru concept,
as all our restaurants have at least one drive-thru lane and generally have a walk-up window where customers may additionally place orders.
Many of our restaurants have no indoor seating and consist of one or two drive-thru lanes and outdoor patio seating. Speed of service
in this segment is critical for success and we average less than three-minute transaction times, as measured from the time the customer
places their order until they leave the drive-thru lane. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, even in our restaurants that feature dine-in
seating, a majority of our sales were conducted through the drive-thru lane. All of our company-owned Good Times restaurants dining rooms
are closed currently and have been since late March 2020. Customers may enter restaurants with dining rooms to place orders and at the
walk-up windows in those locations without dining rooms. Our patios are currently open for outdoor dining. 

The success of our strategy is evident in our long-term same-store
sales growth (sales growth over the prior year period at restaurants open more than 18 months, also referred to as comparable sales).
Same store sales increased 10.5 in fiscal 2021 and 7.9 in fiscal 2020.

Our Business Strengths 

Our Brands Are Complementary. 

While operating in different segments of the restaurant industry,
our two brands complement each other in both their similarities and differences: 

Each has a value proposition enhanced by superior quality ingredients
and a focus on the specific elements of service relevant to the concept that deliver an exceptional experience to each guest. Bad Daddy s
resonates with consumers by consistently executing high-quality, scratch-made menu items with bold flavors delivered in a high-energy
environment with a slightly irreverent brand personality. The appeal of Bad Daddy s supersedes a purely on-premise customer experience
however, as the focus we place on bold, unique flavors; superior ingredients; and scratch cooking in each kitchen translates into significant
off-premise adoption, both through traditional customer carry-out and delivery by third party delivery service providers. 

We believe Good Times is the only drive-thru quick-service chain
in our region with an all-natural platform. We do not offer a low-priced value menu as many national quick-service chains do, choosing
to compete on a market position emphasizing quality with a specific focus on all-natural beef and chicken, and with a variety of price
points across the menu with quick-service restaurant speed of service. The quick-service, and in particular, drive-thru format of our
Good Times concept offers a balancing effect to business cycles that are common in the full-service segment of the restaurant industry. 

Our Brands Have a Common Culture and Operating Philosophy . 

While each of our brands is led by separate operating teams,
each shares a commitment to four core values and four dimensions of our business: 

Core Values. Each brand focuses on developing behaviors
 and expectations around our core values, which we have recently revisited and updated. Our updated values are: 1) Hospitality, 2) Integrity,
 3) Respect, and 4) Entrepreneurship. 

Dimensions of the Business: 

o 
 Individual Fulfillment. Our first value speaks directly to people, whether that is fellow team members
 or our customers. Specific to our team members, we seek to hire people with aligned values and the appropriate knowledge and skills throughout
 the organization, provide them with comprehensive training programs, and provide a framework for self-directed, company-supported continuous
 development, as we believe that the individual fulfillment achieved from self-actualized team members with aligned values will deliver
 consistently superior products and service. We maintain incentive programs at all levels of management based on balanced metrics addressing
 performance related to people development and retention, consistent, strong operations, and superior economic value creation. 

o 
 Our Guests Emotional Connection. Rather than merely being a feeding trough for the masses, we
 strive to differentiate our concepts in a way that creates an emotional connection by the guest to each brand. This emotional connection
 drives loyalty and long-term strength in same-store-sales. 

o 
 Operational Excellence. We are content with neither mediocrity nor the status quo, even if it is good
 enough. Rather we strive for excellence in execution, whether that is within the operations of our restaurants, or the operations
 of our shared services capabilities. We: (1) do things the right way, (2) take pride in our work, (3) take pride in our facilities,
 and (4) take pride in our brand. The pride that is shared by all of us drives us towards excellence in all of our activities. 

o 
 Financial Discipline and Strength . While growth is important, it needs to be sensible and bounded by
 financial strength. We want to achieve both growth in unit volumes and growth in number of units, but at the same time maintain a low
 debt load. 

Our Brands Have Growth Potential. 

We believe both of our brands are well positioned to take advantage
of consumers changing demands for restaurants, whether regarding the quality of the ingredients, the ability to customize their
order exactly to their liking, or the ability to eat their food in a restaurant dining room, on a patio, in their car, or to either
pick it up or have it delivered so they can eat it at their home or office. We believe Good Times and Bad Daddy s are both well
positioned to capitalize on those macro-trends. 

Both of our brands currently operate with relatively small market
penetration and overall development footprints, providing significant expansion potential. It is our goal to primarily grow our Bad Daddy s
brand and to do so relatively contiguously from our existing restaurants in order to maximize brand awareness and operating and distribution
efficiencies. 

Good Times and Bad Daddy s operate with a common point-of-purchase
system and we have implemented a common back office system for both brands. We are also continuing to invest in sophisticated digital
training tools, making each brand s restaurant level processes, systems, recipes and management tools available in one commonly
accessible database.

 Table of Contents 

We Have Assembled a Dedicated Senior Leadership Team with
Significant Experience . 

Each of the members of our senior leadership team have more
than fifteen years of relevant experience in their field of expertise, and nearly all have more than fifteen years of industry experience,
with many members having worked together for more than 20 years developing the Good Times concept. Upon adding the Bad Daddy s concept
to the business, we made strategic hires to complement our management team with individuals with depth of experience in operating and
growing full-service concepts. 

Each brand is operated with distinct operations teams led by
its own operations leader, while utilizing shared support capabilities in administration, finance, accounting, human resources, development,
marketing and information technology, each capability led by its own qualified leader with many years of functional and leadership experience.
We believe we have people with the right expertise as well as capable processes and systems in place to support both concepts and targeted
future growth of the Bad Daddy s concept. 

We Have Maintained Operating Momentum . 

Same-store sales at Good Times have increased nine of the past
ten years. Same-store sales increased for fiscal 2021 primarily due to increased foot traffic throughout the COVID-19 dining room closures
at full-service and fast casual restaurants and price increases of approximately 8.0 . Our compound annual same-store sales growth rate
was approximately 4.7 from fiscal 2015 to fiscal 2021. We believe this performance is largely the result of the evolution in our brand
positioning, the re-imaging of several of our older restaurants, effective management of media mix, and consistent execution of the customer
experience. We plan to continue to periodically re-image and remodel our restaurants, maintain a relevant menu with a laser focus on speed
and accuracy in execution, in keeping with our brand strategy, and communicate our brand story to maintain our same-store sales growth. 

The Bad Daddy s concept was started in 2007 in Charlotte,
North Carolina by a qualified chef and was initially expanded in partnership with a serial restaurant entrepreneur who remains a non-controlling
partner in a five of our Bad Daddy s restaurants. Sales of the Bad Daddy s restaurants which were open for at least 18 months
averaged 2.4 million for fiscal 2021. We opened two traditional restaurants each in fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020 and an additional non-traditional
restaurant in the tap room of the Tivoli brewery in Denver, Colorado. The magnitude of our sales returns in the third and fourth fiscal
quarters upon reopening of dining rooms gives us confidence in the strength of the Bad Daddy s concept and the ability for us to
deliver upon our pre-pandemic model in a post-pandemic world, such that we expect significant long-term expansion potential, both in our
existing markets and in new markets, though we expect such expansion to be disciplined and financed primarily from operating cash flow
from the Bad Daddy s business. 

Business Strategies 

We are focused on continuing to grow same store sales and improve
the profitability of the Good Times concept while continuing targeted unit growth of the Bad Daddy s Burger Bar concept in domestic
markets. We believe that there are significant opportunities to develop new units, grow customer traffic and increase awareness of our
brands. The following sets forth the key elements of our growth strategy: 

1. 
 Increase same-store sales in both brands . We intend to continue to focus on increasing our same-store
 sales. We plan to further strengthen our fresh, all-natural brand positioning at Good Times with targeted merchandising around each
 of our menu categories and a targeted focus on speed and accuracy in execution instead of deep discounts or exotic, limited-reach menu
 items. We also expect to continue various advertising programs, shifting the media mix periodically as we determine appropriate to maximize
 advertising effectiveness and efficiency. At Bad Daddy s, as we emerge from the restrictions and limitations posed on us,
 we intend to continue to highlight our ease of access to our concept whether the dining occasion is an on-premise or off-premise format,
 through continued partnerships with delivery service providers, and identifying innovative ways to better reach all potential customers.
 We further intend to increase Bad Daddy s same store sales through ongoing menu engineering around bold flavors and unique, concept-appropriate
 menu items that we believe drive increased customer visits as well as elevated per person average check. Bad Daddy s advertising
 has traditionally targeted individual trade areas, community involvement and in-store, four-wall marketing activities that
 focus on optimizing the guests food, bar and service experience. We have enhanced those efforts by leveraging third parties who
 specialize in social and digital media advertising design. 

2. 
 Improve operational capabilities. We continue to focus on managing our expenses in the operation of
 our restaurants, with a particular focus on cost of sales, labor and operating expense controls and efficiencies while not adversely impacting
 our overall quality and service proposition. Macroeconomic, state legislative increases to wages and other external factors have resulted
 in upward trends in certain of these operating costs. We continue to implement programs to mitigate the impact of these external factors
 and continue to explore other opportunities to improve efficiency of general and administrative costs. We placed an elevated level of
 focus in managing overhead costs and gaining further efficiencies in supervision and support services costs and believe that those costs
 will be relatively stable, though we expect to invest in modern human resource and financial planning systems that will provide improved
 abilities for our restaurant leaders and support capability leaders to best create value for the business.

 Table of Contents 

3. 
 Pursue disciplined unit growth of Company-operated Bad Daddy s Burger Bar restaurants . We own
 the Bad Daddy s Burger Bar brand, including all associated intellectual property. We have identified potential new restaurant locations
 in the southeast U.S. market which are in various stages of negotiation. We continue to assess our development strategies and intend to
 follow a disciplined strategy of unit growth that may include both company-owned and franchisee-owned units. Consistent with our business
 dimension of Financial Discipline and Strength , we expect that growth in company-owned restaurants will remain more modest than
 it has been in the past and will stem from operating cash flow rather than through the use of significant debt financing to drive more
 rapid growth. 

Expansion strategy and site
selection 

Bad Daddy s Burger Bar 

Our development of the Bad Daddy s Burger Bar concept
in company-owned restaurants has focused on urban and suburban upper income demographic areas with median household incomes over 70,000,
with a high concentration of daytime employment, specialty retail and entertainment venues. We use specialized software to
create a sales forecast for each site and have continued to update the data in that site forecasting software even as we have reduced
growth during 2020. We expect to utilize this software as one component of decision making in the selection of site for future Bad Daddy s
restaurant locations. 

Bad Daddy s Burger Bar locations are primarily end-cap
locations in new and existing shopping center developments using approximately 3,500 to 4,000 square feet. While our Good Times
restaurants are free standing and require extensive site development and entitlement processes, Bad Daddy s Burger Bar restaurants
can be developed much more quickly due to the requirement for only a building permit, signage approvals and liquor license without the
need for extensive on- and off-site development or land and zoning submittals and modifications. We estimate that it will take approximately
120 to 150 days to develop a Bad Daddy s Burger Bar from the time a building permit is issued. We expect that the majority of the
Company s unit growth will be through the development of additional Bad Daddy s Burger Bar locations. 

Good Times Burgers Frozen Custard 

We do not have explicit plans to develop additional Good Times
restaurants, as we continue to refine the economic model of our primarily drive-thru business. However, we expect that any opportunistic
development in Good Times locations would be through a lens of growth in Colorado and potentially surrounding states, which would preserve
operating and marketing efficiencies created by the geographic concentration of our existing base of restaurants. Any development of new
Good Times restaurants would involve a new prototype restaurant design focused primarily on drive-thru with an outside patio but without
any enclosed dining room. 

We currently lease either the land or the land and building
for all of our Good Times restaurants. If we were to develop additional sites, a lease/buy decision would be based upon the
economics of the property and our long-term point of view on the underlying real estate and do not have an explicit preference for leasing
in the case of future Good Times restaurants. Our primary site objective is to secure a suitable site, with the decision to buy or lease
as a secondary objective. Our site selection process includes evaluating several criteria, including a mix of substantial daily
traffic, density of at least 30,000 people within a three-mile radius, strong daytime population and employment base, retail and entertainment
traffic generators, good visibility and easy access. 

Restaurant locations 

As of December 15, 2021, we operate, franchise or license a
total of forty-two Bad Daddy s Burger Bar locations. The location in the Charlotte Douglas International Airport is operated pursuant
to a License Agreement. 

Additionally, we operate or franchise a total of thirty-two
Good Times restaurants.

The non-traditional Bad Daddy s Burger Bar location
is a location where we operate the kitchen under our Bad Daddy s brand for a local brewery s taproom. 

Menu 

Bad Daddy s Burger Bar 

The Bad Daddy's Burger Bar menu offers our guests a culinary-driven
menu consisting of our own unique blend of high quality and handcrafted Angus beef burgers with creative, scratch-made toppings including
buttermilk-fried bacon, housemade American cheese, creamy ale queso made in-house with our Bad Daddy s Amber Ale, and our specialty
signature Bad Daddy s sauce. The customizable menu options also include a variety of proteins including black bean, salmon,
turkey, bison and chicken. Additionally, we offer giant chopped salads, a full gluten-friendly menu, appetizers including hand-cut
fries and housemade potato chips, hand-spun ice cream milk shakes and our scratch-made southern-style banana pudding. 
We feature a variety of craft beers from local breweries and a full bar serving spirits, innovative cocktails, and wines including our
signature Red and White pours. 

Our signature recipes
include the Bad Ass Burger; Sam I Am Burger and Emilio s Chicken Sandwich. Signature Chopped Salads include the Texican Chicken
Salad and the Stella s Greek Salad. The Bad Daddy s Create Your Own menu allows full customization of burgers and salads offering
over sixty topping options. We ve partnered with Full Sail Brewing, Breckenridge Brewing, and Stone Brewery to make our Bad Daddy's
draft brews including Bad Daddy s Amber Ale, IPA, and Blonde. Our creative cocktail menu uses fresh-squeezed housemade sours and
fresh garnishes in our signature Bad Ass Margaritas and features creative and timeless options including the Daddy s Dragonberry
and a Peanut Butter Old Fashioned. 

Bad Daddy s Burger
Bar strives to provide proprietary flavors and recipes available nowhere else with fresh, handcrafted quality throughout the menu paired
with genuine and warm hospitality. We also commit to making occasional changes to keep our menu fresh for our guests while still maintaining
the spirited flavor profiles that distinguish us from others. In addition, we have rotating chef specials with flavor profiles unique
to Bad Daddy's. At times we also feature a burger with local ingredients with a giveback to a local charity.

 Table of Contents 

Good Times Burgers Frozen Custard 

The menu of each Good Times restaurant is focused primarily
on hamburgers, cheeseburgers, chicken sandwiches and chicken tenders that are fresh, never frozen, and using only all-natural beef and
chicken. This menu is supplemented by side selections including two types of french fries, jalapeno potato poppers, and onion rings. Beverages
include typical soft drinks and fresh lemonades, with a selection of frozen custard products. We have a limited breakfast menu consisting
of breakfast burritos, orange juice and coffee and a kid s meal menu featuring a choice of main item, side, drink, and a wooden
nickel that can be redeemed for a free kid s cup or cone of custard. 

Our hamburger patties are made with Meyer all-natural, all-Angus
beef. Our chicken products are sourced from Springer Mountain Farms, which provides all-natural, antibiotic free, humanely-raised chicken.
All-natural Angus beef and chicken are raised without the use of any hormones, antibiotics or animal byproducts that are normally used
in the open market. We believe that all-natural beef and chicken deliver a better tasting product and, because of the rigorous protocols
and testing that are a part of the Meyer all-natural, all-Angus Beef and Springer Mountain Farms Chicken processes, may also minimize
the risk of any food-borne bacteria-related illnesses. We also believe that the use of premium, all-natural beef and chicken products
help us to differentiate our concept in a crowded quick-service segment of the restaurant industry. 

Our fresh frozen custard is a premium ice cream with a proprietary
vanilla blend that is prepared from highly specialized equipment that minimizes the amount of air that is added to the mix and that creates
smaller ice crystals than other frozen dairy desserts. The resulting product is smoother, creamier and thicker than typical
soft serve or hard-packed ice cream products. We serve the frozen custard as vanilla and a flavor of the month in cups and
cones and Spoonbenders, a mix of custard and toppings. 

The breakfast menu is centered around Hatch Valley Green Chile
Burritos made with our own proprietary green chile recipe using roasted green chiles sourced exclusively from Hatch Valley, New Mexico,
eggs, potatoes, and cheese offered with the choice of bacon, sausage or chorizo. We also offer a premium coffee made by Daz Bog, a Colorado-based
coffee roaster, and pure 100 orange juice. 

Marketing Advertising 

Bad Daddy s Burger Bar 

Our marketing strategy for Bad Daddy s Burger Bar focuses
on iconic, in-store merchandising materials and local store marketing to the surrounding trade area around each restaurant, including
public relations and community-based events. We generally do not focus on large media buys or traditional advertising,
but on the in-store customer experience, building word-of-mouth reputation and recommendations and local public relations based on prior
and recent awards and recognitions received by Bad Daddy s. We have recently supplemented this with additional investments in social
and digital media using third party resources who specialize in highly targeted advertisements on social media and digital platforms.
We additionally use public relations, and trade area specific direct mail materials, particularly in support of new restaurant openings,
to drive trial and initial awareness. 

Good Times Burgers Frozen Custard 

Our marketing strategy for Good Times focuses on: 1) driving
same store restaurant sales through attracting new customers and increasing the frequency of visits by current customers; 2) communicating
specific product news and attributes to build strong points of difference from competitors; and 3) communicating a unique, strong and
consistent brand personality. 

Media is an important component of building our brand awareness
and distinctiveness. We spent most of our broadcast advertising dollars on radio advertising during fiscal 2021 and fiscal
2020. We augment our broadcast advertising with a social media presence that affords us a higher level of engagement with
current customers and an increased level of product giveaways to support high sales opportunity products. As with Bad Daddy s, we
have recently supplemented our legacy advertising approach with additional investments in social and digital media using third party resources
who specialize in highly targeted advertisements on social media and digital platforms. 

Operations 

We maintain separate operating teams for each of our concepts
and have extensive operating, training and quality control systems in place.

Restaurant Management 

Bad Daddy s Burger Bar was developed as a chef-driven
concept and utilizes a team of three or four managers in our operations at most restaurants. Managers are cross-trained in back
of the house skills (prep, kitchen positions and line management), front of the house service positions (host, server and bar) and all
management functions, however each manager is assigned one or more specific areas of responsibility over which they have ownership 
and direct accountability for results. Our managers at each restaurant participate in a bonus pool for each restaurant based on a combination
of restaurant sales, income, and specific financial and operational objectives. As a full-service concept, our operating leadership structure
for Bad Daddy s Burger Bar operations is distinct and separate, including a separate operations leader, from our Good Times operations
team as the experience, qualifications and compensation of team members are significantly different between the quick service and full-service
segments of the industry. Although this is the case, we have combined recruiting into a single shared services capability and believe
that long-term our training capabilities for the brands will similarly be combined into single shared services capability. 

Each Good Times restaurant employs a general manager, generally
between one and three hourly assistant managers, up to four hourly shift managers and approximately 10 to 20 non-management team members,
most of whom work part-time during three shifts. Most of our shift managers, assistant managers, and general managers are internally promoted
from team member positions, and in order to become a shift manager, an eight- to ten-week program over which the team member becomes fully
capable on all phases of the operation, is used to train a new shift manager. Ongoing training and development is provided as necessary.
We believe that incentive compensation of our restaurant managers is essential to the success of our business. Accordingly, our general
managers and assistant managers in each restaurant participate in a bonus program based upon meeting financial, customer service and quality
performance objectives tied to a monthly scorecard of measures. 

Operational and Management Systems and Processes 

We have implemented highly-effective operating systems and processes
relative to those in the industry for both of our concepts. Detailed processes have been developed for all responsibilities
that drive consistency across our system of restaurants and performance against our standards within different day parts. We
utilize a combination of industry-leading labor programs and proprietary algorithms to determine optimal staffing needs of each restaurant
based on its actual customer flow and demand. We also employ several additional operational tools to continuously monitor and
improve speed of service, food waste, food quality, sanitation, financial performance and employee development. The order system
at each Good Times restaurant is equipped with an internal timing device that displays and records the time each order takes to prepare
and deliver. 

We use several sources of customer feedback to evaluate each
restaurant s service and quality performance, including an extensive secret shopper program, telephone surveys, website comments
and a customer feedback tool that aggregates all social media comments as well as store by store surveys each week for each restaurant.
We believe that information will assist us in evaluating opportunities for improved execution of the customer experience. 

Training 

We strive to maintain quality and consistency in each of our
restaurants for both Good Times and Bad Daddy s through the careful training and supervision of our restaurant leadership team members
and the establishment of, and adherence to, high standards relating to personnel performance, food and beverage preparation and maintenance
of our restaurants. Each manager must complete an eight- to ten-week training program, be certified on several core processes
and is then closely supervised to show both comprehension and capability before they are allowed to manage autonomously. We
have a defined weekly and monthly goal-setting process around service, employee development, financial management and store maintenance
goals for every restaurant. Additionally, we have a library of video training tools to drive training efficiencies and consistency
at both brands. 

Prior to opening a new restaurant, a training and opening team
travels to the new restaurant location to prepare for an intensive training program for all team members hired for the new restaurant
opening. Part of the training team remains on-site for a period after the opening of the restaurant while an additional team provides
several weeks of support following opening. 

Recruiting and Retention 

At Bad Daddy s we seek to hire experienced restaurant
managers and operating partners. We support employees by offering competitive wages and benefits, including a 401(k) plan,
medical insurance, and incentive plans at every level of management that are tied to performance against key goals and objectives. We
motivate and prepare our employees by providing them with opportunities for increased responsibilities and advancement. We
also provide various other incentives, including paid time off, car allowances, monthly performance bonuses and referral bonuses. We
have implemented an online screening and hiring tool that has proven to reduce hourly employee turnover.

Franchising 

For Bad Daddy s Burger Bar, we have prepared forms of
area rights and franchise agreements, and presently have one existing franchise agreement in force. We anticipate that a franchisee will
typically pay a royalty of 4 to 5 of net sales and will participate in an advertising fund and local advertising by contributing up
to 2 of net sales. Initial development and franchise fees are projected to be 35,000 per restaurant. We
estimate that it will cost a Bad Daddy s Burger Bar franchisee 590,000 to 1,382,000 to open a 3,500 to 4,000 square foot restaurant
in an in-line or end-cap retail center, based on our knowledge of the development costs of the existing Bad Daddy s Burger Bar restaurants.
We are not currently actively soliciting new franchisees but are assessing potential future growth through the development of franchised
Bad Daddy s restaurants. 

For Good Times, we have previously prepared forms of area rights
and franchise agreements and advertising material to be utilized in soliciting prospective franchisees. We have historically sought to
attract franchisees that are experienced restaurant operators, are well capitalized and have demonstrated the ability to develop one to
five restaurants. We review sites selected for franchises and monitor performance of franchise units. Currently, we are not
actively soliciting new franchisees but are assessing potential future growth through the development of franchised Good Times restaurants. 

We currently have one Bad Daddy s franchise agreement
for one restaurant in South Carolina and a license agreement for a Bad Daddy s location in the Charlotte Douglas International Airport.
We currently have six Good Times franchise agreements in the greater Denver metropolitan area and two dual-branded franchised restaurants
operate in Wyoming. In addition, seven joint-venture restaurants are operating in the Denver metropolitan area media market. 

We actively work with and monitor our franchisees to ensure
successful franchise operations as well as compliance with our systems and procedures. We advise the franchisee on menu, management
training and marketing. On an ongoing basis we conduct standards reviews of all franchise restaurants in key areas including
product quality, service standards, restaurant cleanliness and sanitation and food safety. 

Management Information Systems 

The systems in our restaurants are designed in a manner to minimize
the amount of time our managers spend on administrative tasks. We utilize up-to-date versions of a leading point-of-sale system in each
of our company-owned restaurants that captures transaction-level data required to support information about sales, product mix, and average
check. Configuration of restaurant point-of-sales systems is performed by our technology share service capability. 

We use a cloud-based back-office solution across both brands
that collects sales, labor and cash data from the restaurant point-of-sale system in near real-time and is the primary source of capture
for inventory and supply chain management information. This back-office solution interfaces with our primary financial accounting
systems and provides all levels of management with relevant daily, weekly and monthly reports across substantially all store-level income
and expense categories. 

Food Preparation, Quality Control Purchasing 

We believe that we have excellent food quality standards relative
to the industry. Our systems are designed to protect our food supply throughout the preparation process. We inspect
specific qualified manufacturers and work together with those manufacturers to provide specifications and quality controls. Our
operations management teams are trained in a nationally recognized comprehensive safety and sanitation course specific to food service. Minimum
cook temperature requirements, periodic line checks throughout the day, and daily facilities checklists ensure the safety and quality
of both burgers and other items we use in our restaurants. 

We currently purchase 100 of the food and paper supplies for
our Good Times restaurants and the majority of the food and paper supplies for our Bad Daddy s restaurants from US Foods. In addition,
we maintain multiple approved suppliers for all key components of our menu to mitigate risk and ensure supply. Suppliers are
chosen based upon their ability to provide (i) a continuous supply of product that meets all safety and quality specifications, (ii) logistics
expertise and freight management, (iii) product innovation and differentiation, (iv) customer service, (v) transparency of business relationships
and (vi) competitive pricing. Specified products are distributed to all restaurants through US Foods under negotiated contracts
directly to our restaurants two to four times per week depending on restaurant requirements. We do not believe that the current
reliance on these distributors will have any long-term material adverse effect since we believe that there are a sufficient number of
other suppliers from which food and paper supplies could be purchased with little or no interruption in service. We do not
anticipate any difficulty in continuing to obtain an adequate quantity of food and paper supplies of acceptable quality and at acceptable
prices. We monitor the primary commodities we purchase and extend contract positions when applicable in order to minimize the impact of
fluctuations in price and availability. However, certain commodities, primarily ground beef, remain subject to market price fluctuations.

Employees 

At September 28, 2021, we had approximately 2,230 employees
of which 2,011 are hourly team members and 219 are salaried managers working full time. Our set of values includes Respect and Care 
for people, including all of our employees, and one of the dimensions of our business is Individual Fulfillment . We strive to provide
competitive salary and benefits, strong development opportunities, and a meaningful job or career for all of our employees and believe
that this has translated into good employee relations. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement. 

COVID-19 Response 

We took early action regarding employee well-being in response
to the COVID-19 pandemic, implementing comprehensive protocols to protect the health and safety of our employees and guests. Remote work
for corporate management and staff was adopted ahead of state and county requirements. We limited reductions in scheduled hours for employees
in our company-operated restaurants. For employees of our company-operated restaurants, we also enhanced our benefits programs to offer
expanded supplemental paid sick leave ahead of mandates in the majority of the state and county mandates and in counties where sick leave
is not mandated, waived employee cost-sharing for COVID-19 testing and moved our tele-med offerings from telephone only to include virtual
visits at the same copay cost. We believe that employee sentiment regarding our response to the pandemic is very favorable. 

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, staffing levels for each concept
were adjusted to meet guest traffic determined by the then current state orders closing on-premise dining and/or limiting occupancy. All
of our dining rooms at Bad Daddy s are currently open, and we are currently operating our restaurants to their full capacity, with
some constraints due to the availability of qualified staff. We continue to monitor consumer, employer, and regulatory behaviors related
to the ongoing impacts of COVID-19 and adjust our operations accordingly to provide a safe environment for our customers and employees,
and to be compliant with appropriate regulatory requirements. 

Competition 

The restaurant industry, including both limited service and
full-service segments, is highly competitive. Bad Daddy s Burger Bar competes with both local, regional, and national gourmet, better
burger concepts as well as more legacy grill and bar concepts. As such, Bad Daddy s competes with both full-service
and limited service better burger restaurants. There are other burger-centric fast casual concepts that operate at a lower
average customer check than Bad Daddy s Burger Bar and others in both fast casual and full-service formats that operate with a higher
average customer check. We believe that we offer sufficient price choice to be able to compete effectively in the full range of such concepts. We
believe that Bad Daddy s Burger Bar has an advantage in the premium quality of our ingredients, unparalleled ability for guests
to customize their order, distinctiveness of its atmosphere and the bold, unique flavors of our scratch-made, chef-inspired menu offerings. Nevertheless,
Bad Daddy s Burger Bar may be at a competitive disadvantage to other restaurant chains with greater name recognition and operating
mass. 

Good Times competes with many other hamburger-oriented
quick-service restaurants in the areas in which it operates. Many of these restaurants are owned and operated by regional and national
restaurant chains, many of which have greater financial resources and experience than we do. In-N-Out, a California-based, burger-focused
quick-service restaurant concept, has expanded into the Colorado market and Whataburger, a Texas-based burger-focused quick-service restaurant
concept has announced its intent to expand into the Colorado market. Double drive-thru restaurant chains such as Rally s Hamburgers
and Checker s Drive-In Restaurants, which currently operate double drive-thru restaurants in various markets in the United States,
are not currently operating in Colorado. We are aware of only two significant quick-service competitors offering frozen custard as a primary
menu item operating in the Colorado market and both have a significant presence in Midwestern markets that may be targeted for expansion.
Additional fast casual hamburger restaurants are being developed in the Colorado market; however, these generally do not
have drive-thru service and generate an average per person check that is meaningfully higher than the average check at a Good Times restaurant. 

We believe that Good Times may have a competitive
advantage in terms of quality of product compared to traditional quick-service hamburger chains. Early development of our double
drive-thru concept in Colorado has given us an advantage over other drive-thru chains that may seek to expand into Colorado because of
our brand awareness and present restaurant locations. Nevertheless, we may be at a competitive disadvantage to other restaurant
chains with greater name recognition and marketing capability. Furthermore, most of our competitors in the fast-food business
operate more restaurants, have been established longer, and have greater financial resources and name recognition than we do. There
is also active competition for management personnel, as well as for attractive commercial real estate sites suitable for restaurants. 

Intellectual Property 

We have registered our marks Bad Daddy s Burger
Bar and Good Times with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. We received approval of our federal
registration of Bad Daddy s Burger Bar in 2011 and Good Times in 2003. Additionally, we own
trademarks or service marks that have been registered with the United States Patent and Trademark Office including, but not limited to,
 Bad Daddy s Burger Bar EST. 2007 , Big Daddy Bacon Cheeseburger, Chicken Dunkers, and Happiness
Made To Order . The registration for our Bad Daddy s Burger Bar mark will be renewed prior to September
2031. The registration for our Good Times marks will be renewed prior to December 2023 and February 2028 respectively. We
intend to maintain our marks and renew registrations on a timely basis.

Government Regulation 

Each of our restaurants is subject to the regulations of various
health, sanitation, safety and fire agencies in the jurisdiction in which the restaurant is located. Difficulties or failures
in obtaining the required licenses or approvals could delay or prevent the opening of a new restaurant. Federal and state environmental
regulations have not had a material effect on our operations. More stringent and varied requirements of local governmental bodies with
respect to zoning, land use and environmental factors could delay or prevent development of new restaurants in particular locations. We
are subject to the Fair Labor Standards Act, which governs such matters as minimum wages, overtime, and other working conditions. In
addition, we are subject to the Americans with Disabilities Act, which requires restaurants and other facilities open to the public to
provide for access and use of facilities by the handicapped. Management believes that we are in compliance with the Americans
with Disabilities Act. Beginning in 2015, we became subject to the Affordable Care Act which requires us to have the required health insurance
benefits for eligible employees. 

We are also subject to federal and state laws regulating franchise
operations, which vary from registration and disclosure requirements in the offer and sale of franchises to the application of statutory
standards regulating franchise relationships. Many state franchise laws impose restrictions on the franchise agreements, including limitations
on non-competition provisions and the termination or non-renewal of a franchise. Some states require that franchise materials be registered
before franchises can be offered or sold in that state. 

In addition, each Bad Daddy s Burger Bar restaurant requires
a liquor license and adherence to the attendant laws and requirements regulating the serving and consumption of alcohol. Alcoholic
beverage control regulations govern various aspects of these restaurants daily operations, including the minimum age of patrons
and employees, hours of operation, advertising, wholesale purchasing and inventory control, handling and storage. Typically,
licenses to sell alcoholic beverages will require annual renewal and may be suspended or revoked at any time for cause, the definition
of which varies by locality.

ITEM 1A. 
 RISK FACTORS 

You should consider carefully the following risk factors before
making an investment decision with respect to our securities. You are cautioned that the risk factors discussed below are not exhaustive. 

Risks Related to Our Business 

The outbreak of, and local, state and federal governmental
responses to, the COVID-19 pandemic have significantly disrupted and will continue to disrupt our business, which has and could continue
to materially affect our financial condition and operating results for an extended period of time. 

The global crisis resulting from the spread of COVID-19 had
a substantial impact on our restaurant operations for the fiscal years ended September 28, 2021 and September 29, 2020. 

16 

 Table of Contents 

During portions of the month of March 2020 through
late May 2020, all of the Company s Bad Daddy s Burger Bar restaurants were open only for delivery and carry-out service,
with dining rooms closed by government orders. Although our dining rooms were re-opened in early June 2020, all continued to operate at
some reduction of capacity, whether driven by explicit capacity reductions under government orders, or due to social distancing protocols
that were either mandated by the same government orders or followed our own internal protocols designed to maintain a safe foodservice
environment, both for our employees and for our customers, until May 2021. 

During portions of the month of November 2020 through early
January 2021, all of the Company s Bad Daddy s Burger Bar restaurants in Colorado were open only for limited outdoor dining,
delivery and carry-out service, with indoor dining rooms once again closed by government orders. In early January 2021, we re-opened these
dining rooms, with limited occupancy, as local regulations allowed. Our dining rooms in all other states in which Bad Daddy s has
operations were open, at reduced capacity, during this time. Presently, all of our Bad Daddy s restaurants are allowed to operate
at full capacity. 

Our operating results substantially depend upon our ability
to drive traffic to our restaurants, and for our Bad Daddy s Burger Bar restaurants, to serve guests in our dining rooms. We cannot
currently estimate the duration of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, including the recent acceleration of the spread
of the Delta variant of COVID-19; neither are we able to predict how the pandemic will evolve nor how various government entities will
respond to its evolution. Should additional dining room closures occur, our business would be adversely affected. Even without government
orders, customers may choose to reduce or eliminate in-restaurant dining because of increasing numbers of COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations,
or deaths. Furthermore, although certain available vaccines may reduce the risk of further government restrictions, there is no guarantee
that the vaccine will be effective in eradicating the virus, additional mutations or variants of the virus may be resistant to any vaccine,
and the length of the ongoing pandemic may change consumer behavior such that potential customers may still choose to reduce or eliminate
in-restaurant dining. 

Additionally, in connection with spread of COVID-19, there have
been disruptions in various food supply chains in the United States. Our operating results substantially depend upon our ability to obtain
sufficient quantities of products such as beef, bacon, and other products used in the production of items served and sold to our guests.
Ongoing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic could result in product shortages and in-turn could require us to serve a limited menu, restrict
the number of items purchased per guest, or close some or all of our restaurants for an indeterminate period of time. Ongoing material
adverse impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic, including recent industry-wide labor shortages, the impact and duration of which are uncertain,
could result in reduced revenue and cash flow and could affect our assessments of impairment of intangible assets, long-lived assets,
or goodwill. 

We took extraordinary actions to increase our liquidity in response
to COVID-19 during fiscal 2020, including temporarily reducing employee pay, reductions in workforce, and obtaining Paycheck Protection
Program (the PPP loans. The PPP is sponsored by the Small Business Administration (the SBA ). The PPP is part
of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (the CARES Act ). We have since significantly increased employment
levels and restored pay to employees. 

We currently have a meaningful cash balance and generated significant
cash flow from operations during fiscal 2021. We used a portion of this cash balance to repurchase Company stock pursuant to the Tender
Offer. While we believe that we will continue to have adequate working capital to meet our current needs, should business decline significantly,
we would not likely choose to, and we may not be able to, take some of the same actions as we took during fiscal 2020 to increase our
liquidity as they would negatively impact the long-term performance of the business. Furthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic is adversely affecting
the availability of liquidity generally in the credit markets, and there can be no guarantee that additional liquidity will be available
on favorable terms, or at all, especially the longer various tangential impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic last. 

The equity markets in the United States have been extremely
volatile due to the COVID-19 outbreak and our stock price has fluctuated. 

We have accumulated losses and cannot guarantee future
profits. 

We have incurred losses in 29 of our 34 years since inception. As
of September 28, 2021, we had an accumulated deficit of 27,680,000. Although we generated net income in the current year,
in light of the uncertainty of the COVID-19 pandemic and the lingering impacts on our supply chain and employee markets, we cannot provide
assurance that we will produce income again or generate a loss for the fiscal year ending September 27, 2022. 

If we are unable to continue to increase same store sales
at existing restaurants, our ability to attain profitability may be adversely affected. 

We have increased same-store sales for nine of the past ten
years at Good Times. We have operated Bad Daddy s for a shorter period of time and have had negative same store sales
for that concept in two of the past three fiscal years. Same-store sales increases will depend in part on the success of our advertising
and promotion of new and existing menu items and consumer acceptance and could be greatly impacted by future effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. We
cannot assure that our advertising and promotional efforts will in fact be successful, nor that sales volumes will be fully restored after
COVID-19 subsides. If our same-store sales decrease, and our operating costs increase, our ability to attain profitability
will be adversely affected.

 Table of Contents 

New restaurants, when and if opened, may not be profitable,
if at all, for several months. 

We anticipate that our new restaurants, when and if opened,
will generally take several months to reach normalized operating levels due to inefficiencies typically associated with new restaurants,
including lack of market awareness, the need to hire and train a sufficient number of employees, operating costs which are often materially
greater during the first several months of operation than thereafter, preopening costs and other factors. In addition, restaurants
opened in new markets may open at lower average weekly sales volumes than restaurants opened in existing markets and may have higher restaurant
level operating expense ratios than in existing markets. Sales at restaurants opened in new markets may take longer to reach
average annual company-owned restaurant sales, if at all, thereby affecting the profitability of these restaurants. 

Our operations are susceptible to the cost of and changes
in food availability which could adversely affect our operating results. 

Our profitability depends in part on our ability to anticipate
and react to changes in food costs. Various factors beyond our control, including adverse weather conditions, governmental
regulation, production, availability, recalls of food products, seasonality and COVID-19-related factors may affect our food costs or
cause a disruption in our supply chain. We enter into annual contracts with our chicken and other miscellaneous suppliers. Our
Good Times contracts for chicken are fixed price contracts. Our Bad Daddy s contracts for chicken and all contracts for
beef are generally based on current market prices plus a processing fee. Changes in the price or availability of our all-natural
chicken or beef supply or other commodities could materially adversely affect our profitability. We cannot predict whether
we will be able to anticipate and react to changing food costs by adjusting our purchasing practices and menu prices, and a failure to
do so could adversely affect our operating results. In addition, we may not be able to pass along higher costs through price
increases to our customers. 

Macroeconomic conditions could affect our operating results. 

General economic conditions, including economic downturns related
to the COVID-19 pandemic, have adversely affected our results of operations and may continue to do so. If the economy experiences a more
significant economic downturn or there are uncertainties regarding economic recovery, consumer spending and the unemployment rate may
be affected, which may adversely affect our sales in the future. A proliferation of heavy discounting by our major competitors
may also negatively affect our sales and operating results. 

Price increases may impact customer visits. 

We may make price increases on selected menu items in order
to offset increased operating expenses we believe will be recurring. Although we have not experienced significant consumer
resistance to our past price increases, future price increases may deter customers from visiting our restaurants or affect their purchasing
decisions. 

The hamburger restaurant market is highly competitive. 

The hamburger restaurant market is highly competitive. Our
competitors in the quick-service restaurant segment include many recognized national and regional fast-food hamburger restaurant chains,
such as McDonald s, Burger King, Wendy s, Carl s Jr., Sonic, Jack in the Box, Freddy s and Culver s. In-N-Out
has expanded into the state of Colorado, the primary state in which we operate, and is continuing to expand in the market, and Whataburger
has announced its intention to expand into the state of Colorado. We also compete with small regional and local hamburger and other fast-food
restaurants, many of which feature drive-thru service. Most of our competitors have greater financial resources, marketing programs and
name recognition than we do. Discounting by our quick-service restaurant competitors may adversely affect the revenues and profitability
of our restaurants. 

While Bad Daddy s Burger Bar operates in the better
burger restaurant segment, it offers a relatively broad menu and also competes with other full-service restaurants in the bar and
grill segment. Additionally, customers of both our Good Times restaurants and Bad Daddy s Burger Bar restaurants are
also customers of fast casual hamburger restaurants. Further, changes in customer taste preferences, dietary trends, and preference for
delivery and/or carry-out options often affect the restaurant business. If we are unable to continue to compete effectively with other
restaurant concepts, our traffic, sales, and restaurant-level profitability could be negatively affected. 

Sites for new restaurants may be difficult to acquire. 

Locating our restaurants in high-traffic and readily accessible
areas is an important factor for our success. We intend to continue to locate Bad Daddy s Burger Bar restaurants in
leased in-line and end-cap retail locations. Since suitable locations are in great demand, in the future we may not be able
to obtain optimal sites for either of our restaurant concepts at a reasonable cost or at all. In addition, we cannot assure
you that the sites we do obtain will be successful.

Our franchisees could take actions that could harm our
business. 

Franchisees are independent contractors and are not our employees. We
provide training and support to franchisees; however, franchisees operate their restaurants as independent businesses. Consequently,
the quality of franchised restaurant operations may be diminished by any number of factors beyond our control. Moreover, franchisees
may not successfully operate restaurants in a manner consistent with our standards and requirements or may not hire and train qualified
managers and other restaurant personnel. Our image and reputation, and the image and reputation of other franchisees, may suffer
materially, and system-wide sales could significantly decline, if our franchisees do not operate successfully. 

We depend on key management employees. 

We believe our current operations and future success depend
largely on the continued services of our management employees, in particular Ryan Zink, our President and Chief Executive Officer, Scott
LeFever, our Vice President of Operations for Good Times, and James Abbott, our Vice President of Operations for Bad Daddy s. Although
we have entered into employment agreements with Messrs. Zink and LeFever, they may voluntarily terminate their employment with us at any
time. In addition, we do not currently maintain key-person insurance on the lives of Messrs. Zink or LeFever. We have not entered into
an employment agreement with Messr. Abbott. The loss of Messrs. Zink s, LeFever s, or Abbott s services, or those of
other key management personnel, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. 

Labor shortages could slow our growth or harm our business. 

Our success depends in part upon our ability to attract, motivate
and retain a sufficient number of qualified, high-energy employees. Qualified individuals needed to fill these positions are
in short supply in some areas, and in 2021 we have seen an extreme shortage of qualified workers by historical standards as has been reported
in various news outlets. The inability to recruit and retain these individuals may delay the planned openings of new restaurants
or result in high employee turnover in existing restaurants, which could harm our business. Additionally, competition for qualified
employees has required us to pay meaningfully higher wages to attract enough employees than has historically been the case, and continued
tightness in labor markets could result in continued escalation of labor costs. Most of our employees are paid market wages
on an hourly basis that are influenced by applicable minimum wage regulations. Accordingly, any increase in the minimum wage,
whether state or federal, could have a material adverse impact on our business. 

Increasingly competitive labor markets and our need to
provide additional incentives to remain competitive in our hiring and retention efforts may continue to negatively impact our margins
and, if we are unable to staff and retain qualified restaurant management and operating personnel, we may be unable to effectively operate
and grow our business and revenues, which could materially adversely affect our financial performance. 

Our ongoing success requires us to attract, motivate and retain
a sufficient number of qualified, high-energy employees, including both restaurant managers and crew. However, qualified individuals needed
to fill these positions are in short supply in many areas, and we and other companies in our industry have experienced high turnover.
Many individuals have left the restaurant industry altogether due to difficult pandemic-related operating demands and, in some cases,
current unemployment subsidies. These conditions have resulted in aggressive competition for talent, wage inflation and pressure to improve
benefits and workplace conditions to remain competitive and attract talent, which in turn has led to higher labor costs and margin compression.
If this trend continues, it will negatively impact our ability to effectively operate and grow our business and revenues and materially
adversely affect our financial performance. 

If we fail to appropriately plan and sustain our workforce and
proactively respond to employee dissatisfaction, it could adversely impact guest satisfaction and operational efficiency, lead to increased
litigation and unionization efforts and negatively impact restaurant profitability. Our restaurants could be short staffed, we may be
forced to incur overtime expenses, and our ability to operate and expand our concepts effectively and meet customer demand could be limited.
Difficulties recruiting and retaining new restaurant crew members in a timely manner also negatively impacts our ability to grow sales
at existing restaurants and open new restaurants. Any or all of these factors any could materially adversely affect our financial performance. 

Security breaches of confidential customer information
in connection with our electronic processing of credit and debit card transactions may adversely affect our business. 

The majority of our restaurant sales are by credit or debit
cards. Other restaurants and retailers have experienced security breaches in which credit and debit card information of their customers
has been stolen. We may in the future become subject to lawsuits or other proceedings for purportedly fraudulent transactions arising
out of the actual or alleged theft of our customers credit or debit card information. In addition, most states have enacted legislation
requiring notification of security breaches involving personal information, including credit and debit card information. Any such claim,
proceeding, or mandatory notification could cause us to incur significant unplanned expenses, which could have an adverse impact on our
financial condition and results of operations. Further, adverse publicity resulting from these allegations may have a material adverse
effect on us and our restaurants.

 Table of Contents 

We are subject to extensive government regulation that
may adversely hinder or impact our ability to govern various aspects of our business including our ability to expand and develop our restaurants. 

The restaurant industry is subject to various federal, state
and local government regulations, including those relating to the sale of food. Our failure to maintain necessary governmental licenses,
permits and approvals, including food licenses, could adversely affect our operating results. Difficulties or failures in obtaining
the required licenses and approvals could delay, or result in our decision to cancel, the opening of new restaurants. Local
authorities may suspend or deny renewal of our food licenses if they determine that our conduct does not meet applicable standards or
if there are changes in regulations. In addition, any adverse food safety event could result in regulatory and other investigations, and/or
fines and penalties, any of which could disrupt our operations, increase our costs, require us to respond to findings from regulatory
agencies that may divert resources and assets, and result in potential fines and penalties as well as other gal action, any of which could
materially adversely affect our financial performance. 

Various federal, state and labor laws govern our relationship
with our employees and affect operating costs. These laws govern minimum wage requirements, overtime pay, meal and rest breaks,
unemployment tax rates, workers compensation rates, citizenship or residency requirements, child labor regulations and sales taxes. Additional
government-imposed increases in minimum wages, overtime pay, paid leaves of absence and mandated health benefits may increase our operating
costs. Several states and cities, including the city of Denver and the state of Colorado, where many of our restaurants are located, have
legislation passed which provides for annual increases in their respective minimum wage. Additional states may raise their respective
minimum wage in the future. This could impact the profitability of existing restaurants as well as impact development opportunities
in those states. 

The federal Americans with Disabilities Act prohibits discrimination
on the basis of disability in public accommodations and employment. Although our restaurants are designed to be accessible
to the disabled, we could be required to make modifications to our restaurants to provide service to, or make reasonable accommodations
for, disabled persons. 

We are also subject to federal and state laws that regulate
the offer and sale of franchises and aspects of the licensor-licensee relationship. Many state franchise laws impose restrictions
on the franchise agreement, including limitations on non-competition provisions and the termination or non-renewal of a franchise. Some
states require that franchise materials be registered before franchises can be offered or sold in the state. 

Our Bad Daddy s Burger Bar restaurants are also subject
to state and local laws that regulate the sale of alcoholic beverages. Alcoholic beverage control regulations govern various
aspects of these restaurants daily operations, including the minimum age of patrons and employees, hours of operation, advertising,
wholesale purchasing and inventory control, handling and storage. Typically, licenses to sell alcoholic beverages require annual
renewal and may be suspended or revoked at any time for cause, the definition of which varies by locality. The failure of any
of our Bad Daddy s Burger Bar restaurants to timely obtain and maintain any required licenses, permits or approvals to serve alcoholic
beverages could delay or prevent the opening of a new restaurant or prevent regular day-to-day operations, including the sale of alcoholic
beverages, at a restaurant that is already operating, any of which would adversely affect our business. 

The recently-released Emergency Temporary Standard ETS from OSHA provides guidance surrounding requirements related to vaccination against COVID-19 among our employees. Although the ETS provides
for the alternative of weekly testing for the virus and also allows employers to shift the cost burden of this testing to employees, labor
markets, competitive forces, and practical application may dictate that we would shoulder the cost of such testing, which could result
in meaningful costs that have not been incurred to-date. Additionally, beliefs, perceptions, and behaviors among employees relative to
either vaccination or testing, could result in employees choosing not to work for us, or other companies bound by the ETS, and further
limit the supply of labor. 

Concerns relating to food safety, food-borne illness,
pandemics and other diseases could reduce customer traffic to our restaurants, or cause us to be the target of litigation, which could
materially adversely affect our financial performance. 

We face food safety risks, including the risk of food-borne
illness and food contamination (including allergen cross contamination), which are common both in the restaurant industry and the food
supply chain. While we dedicate substantial resources and provide training to ensure the safety and quality of the food we serve, these
risks cannot be completely eliminated. Additionally, we rely on our network of suppliers to properly handle, store and transport our ingredients
for delivery to our restaurants. Any failure by our suppliers, or their suppliers, could cause our ingredients to be contaminated, which
could be difficult to detect and put the safety of our food in jeopardy. 

20 

 Table of Contents 

In addition to the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19, consumer
preferences could be affected by health concerns about outbreaks of other viruses, including various strains of influenza; the consumption
of beef, the key ingredient in many of our menu items; or negative publicity concerning food quality, illness and injury generally, such
as negative publicity concerning E. coli, mad cow or foot-and-mouth disease, publication of government or
industry findings concerning food products served by us, or other health concerns or operating issues stemming from one restaurant or
a limited number of restaurants. This negative publicity may adversely affect demand for our food and could result in a decrease
in customer traffic to our restaurants. If we react to the negative publicity by changing our concept or our menu, we may lose
customers who do not prefer the new concept or menu, and we may not be able to attract a sufficient new customer base to produce the revenue
needed to make our restaurants profitable. In addition, we may have different or additional competitors for our intended customers
as a result of a concept change and may not be able to compete successfully against those competitors. A decrease in customer
traffic to our restaurants as a result of these health concerns or negative publicity or as a result of a change in our menu or concept
could materially harm our business. Additionally, if our customers or staff members become infected with a pathogen which was actually
or claimed to be contracted at our restaurants, customers may avoid our restaurants and/or it may become difficult to adequately staff
our restaurants. Any adverse food safety occurrence may result in litigation against us. The negative publicity associated with such an
event could damage our reputation and materially adversely affect our financial performance. 

If we are unable to protect our reputation, the value
of our brands and sales at our restaurants may be negatively impacted, which may materially adversely affect our financial performance. 

One of our largest assets is the value of our brands, which
is directly linked to our reputation. We must protect our reputation in order to continue to be successful and to grow the value of our
brands. Negative publicity directed at any of our brands, regardless of factual basis, such as, relating to food quality, restaurant
facilities, customer complaints or litigation alleging injury or food-borne illnesses, food tampering or contamination or poor health
inspection scores, sanitary or other issues with respect to food processing by us or our suppliers, the condition of our restaurants,
labor relations, any failure to comply with applicable regulations or standards, allegations of harassment, or other negative publicity,
could damage our reputation. Negative publicity about us could harm our reputation and damage the value of our brands, which could materially
and adversely affect our financial performance. 

Our ability to succeed with the Bad Daddy s Burger
Bar restaurant concept will require significant capital expenditures and management attention. 

We believe that new openings of Bad Daddy s Burger Bar
restaurants are likely to serve as the primary contributor of our new unit growth and increased profitability over the longer term based
on the unit economics of that concept. Our ability to succeed with this concept will require significant capital expenditures
and management attention and is subject to certain risks in addition to those of opening a new Good Times restaurant, including customer
acceptance of and competition with the Bad Daddy s Burger Bar concept. If the ramp-up period for new Bad
Daddy s Burger Bar restaurants does not meet our expectations, our operating results may be adversely affected. There
can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully develop and grow the Bad Daddy s Burger Bar concept to a point where it
will become profitable or generate positive cash flow. We may not be able to attract enough customers to meet targeted levels
of performance at new Bad Daddy s Burger Bar restaurants because potential customers may be unfamiliar with the concept or the atmosphere
or menu might not be appealing to them. If we cannot successfully execute our growth strategies for Bad Daddy s Burger
Bar, our business and results of operations may be adversely affected. 

Our growth, including the development of Bad Daddy s
Burger Bar restaurants, may strain our management and infrastructure. 

Any growth of our business would increase our operating complexity
and place increased demands on our management and infrastructure, including our current restaurant management systems, financial and management
controls, and information systems. If our infrastructure is insufficient to support our growth, our ability to open new restaurants,
including the development of the Bad Daddy s Burger Bar concept, would be adversely affected. 

Bad Daddy s Burger Bar is subject to all of the
risks of a relatively new business, including competition, and there is no guarantee of a return on our capital investment. 

The Bad Daddy s Burger Bar concept has been in existence
for approximately twelve years. Existing restaurants are currently located in Colorado, Georgia, Oklahoma, North Carolina, South Carolina,
Alabama, and Tennessee. Because of the small number of existing Bad Daddy s Burger Bar restaurants and the relatively
short period of time that they have been in operation, there is substantial uncertainty that additional restaurants in other locations
will be successful. There is no guarantee that we will be successful in offering Bad Daddy s Burger Bar franchises throughout
the U.S. or that, if and when such franchises are granted, the restaurants developed by franchisees will be successful. There
is also substantial uncertainty that the franchising business will be successful in view of the facts that we have sold only two Bad Daddy s
Burger Bar restaurant franchises to date and that the restaurant franchising business is very competitive.

Costs associated with our employee health care programs
continue to escalate and we may not be able to fully pass along those costs increases to employees. 

We maintain various health care programs, including coverage
for medical claims, to employees who select such programs. All of our salaried managers are eligible to participate in these programs
and those of our hourly employees who meet the service requirements under the Affordable Care Act are also eligible. We maintain insurance
coverage for claims in excess of a certain threshold on a per-member basis but do not maintain insurance coverage for aggregate claims.
We have a limited number of participants in our plans and should a significant number of participants report claims in a given year, the
actual claims under the plan may meaningfully exceed our expected claims, and any such costs would be borne by us and not by the participants
in the plan (our Employees). 

Risks Related to the Ownership of Our Common Stock 

Our business could be negatively affected as a result
of significant shareholders or potential shareholders attempting to effect changes or acquire control over our company, which could cause
us to incur significant expense, hinder execution of our business strategy and impact the trading value of our securities. 

Shareholders may from time-to-time attempt to effect changes,
engage in proxy solicitations or advance shareholder proposals. Responding to proxy contests and other actions by activist shareholders
can be costly and time-consuming, disrupting our operations and diverting the attention of our board of directors and senior management
from the pursuit of business strategies. Any of these impacts could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results.
Further, the market price of our common stock could be subject to significant fluctuation or otherwise be adversely affected by the events,
risks and uncertainties described above. 

Future changes in financial accounting standards may cause
adverse unexpected operating results and affect our reported results of operations. 

Changes in accounting standards can have a significant effect
on our reported results and may affect our reporting of transactions completed before the change is effective. See Note 1 to our Consolidated
Financial Statements for further discussion. New pronouncements and varying interpretations of pronouncements have occurred and may occur
in the future. Changes to existing rules or differing interpretations with respect to our current practices may adversely affect our reported
financial results. 

Because we currently qualify as a smaller reporting company, 
our disclosures of non-financial and financial information are less than is required by non-smaller reporting companies. 

Currently we qualify as a smaller reporting company 
under SEC rules. A smaller reporting company prepares and files SEC reports and registration statements using the same forms as other
SEC reporting companies, though the information required to be disclosed may differ and be less comprehensive. 

We cannot predict whether investors will find our common stock
less attractive because of our reliance on any of the reduced disclosure requirements available to smaller reporting companies. If some
investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock
price may be more volatile. 

The price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly. 

The trading price of our shares of common stock has from time-to-time
fluctuated widely and, in the future may be subject to similar fluctuations. This volatility may affect the price at which you could sell
your common stock. The market price of our common stock is likely to continue to be volatile and may fluctuate significantly in response
to many factors, including: 

the impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic on our business; 

operating results that vary from the expectations of management, securities analysts and investors; 

developments in our business; 

the operating and securities price performance of companies that investors consider to be comparable
 to us; 

announcements of implementation of strategic transactions or developments and other material
 events by us or our competitors; 

negative economic conditions that adversely affect the economy, commodity prices, the job market
 and other factors that may affect the markets in which we operate; 

publication of research reports about us or the sectors in which we operate generally; 

changes in market valuations of similar companies; 

additions or departures of key management personnel; 

actions by institutional shareholders; 

22 

 Table of Contents 

speculation in the press or investment community; and 

the realization of any of the other risk factors included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Holders of our common stock will be subject to the risk of volatile
and depressed market prices of our common stock. In addition, many of the factors listed above are beyond our control. These factors may
cause the market price of our common stock to decline, regardless of our financial condition, results of operations, business or prospects.
It is impossible to assure investors in our common stock that the market price of our common stock will not fall in the future. 

Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market
by our existing Shareholders could cause our stock price to fall. 

Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock
in the public market, or the perception that these sales might occur, could depress the market price of our common stock and could impair
our ability to raise adequate capital through the sale of additional equity securities. We are unable to predict the effect that sales
may have on the prevailing market price of our common stock. 

There may be future sales or other dilution of our equity,
which may adversely affect the market price of the shares of our common stock and/or dilute the value of shares of our common stock. 

We are not restricted from issuing, and shareholder approval
is not required in order to issue, additional shares of common stock, including securities that are convertible into or exchangeable for,
or that represent the right to receive, shares of common stock, except any shareholder approval required by The NASDAQ Capital Markets.
We have in the past, and may in the future, sell such equity and equity-linked securities. Sales of a substantial number of shares of
our common stock or other equity-related securities in the public market could depress the market price of our shares of common stock.
We cannot predict the effect that future sales of our common stock or other equity-related securities would have on the market price of
our shares of common stock. The market price of our common stock may be adversely affected if we issue additional shares of our common
stock. 

Provisions in our articles of incorporation and bylaws
and provisions of Nevada law may prevent or delay an acquisition of our company, which could decrease the trading price of our common
stock. 

We are subject to anti-takeover laws for Nevada corporations. These
anti-takeover laws prevent a Nevada corporation from engaging in a business combination with any shareholder, including all affiliates
and associates of the shareholder, who is the beneficial owner of 10 or more of the corporation s outstanding voting stock, for
two years following the date that the shareholder first became the beneficial owner of 10 or more of the corporation s voting stock,
unless specified conditions are met. If those conditions are not met, then after the expiration of the two-year period the
corporation may not engage in a business combination with such shareholder unless certain other conditions are met. 

Our articles of incorporation and our bylaws contain several
provisions that may deter or impede takeovers or changes of control or management. These provisions: 

authorize our board of directors to establish one or more series
 of preferred stock the terms of which can be determined by the board of directors at the time of issuance; 

do not allow for cumulative voting in the election of directors
 unless required by applicable law. Under cumulative voting a minority shareholder holding a sufficient percentage of a class
 of shares may be able to ensure the election of one or more directors; 

state that special meetings of our shareholders may be called only
 by the chairman of the board of directors, the president or any two directors and must be called by the president upon the written request
 of the holders of 25 of the outstanding shares of capital stock entitled to vote at such special meeting; and 

provide that the authorized number of directors is no more than five, as determined by our
 board of directors. 

These provisions, alone or in combination with each other, may
discourage transactions involving actual or potential changes of control, including transactions that otherwise could involve payment
of a premium over prevailing market prices to shareholders for their common stock.

ITEM 2. 
 PROPERTIES 

We currently lease approximately 5,100 square feet of space
for our executive offices in Golden, Colorado for approximately 76,500 per year, beginning November 1, 2021, under a lease agreement
which expires in October 2026. In October 2021 we executed an extension amendment to this lease whereby we will lease an additional 2,550
square feet. Upon completion of the office expansion the cost will increase to 114,750 per year. Most of our existing Good Times restaurants
are a combination of free-standing structures containing approximately 880 to 1,000 square feet for the double drive thru format and approximately
2,100 to 2,400 square feet for those locations with a 45 to 70 seat dining room. We do not own any of the land underlying these restaurants
and either lease the land or the land and building. In addition, we have several restaurants that are conversions from other concepts
in various sizes ranging from 1,700 square feet to 3,500 square feet. The buildings are situated on lots of approximately 18,000 to 50,000
square feet. Certain restaurants serve as collateral for the underlying debt financing arrangements as discussed in the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements included in this report. Any future development is expected to be conducted through a combination of ground leases
and land purchases. 

Our Bad Daddy s restaurants are leased spaces of approximately
3,500 to 4,000 square feet in retail developments located in Alabama, Colorado, Georgia, Oklahoma, North Carolina, Tennessee and South
Carolina. We expect future development to be conducted through the leasing of end-cap spaces in retail developments, ground leases, and
or land purchases upon which we would be able to build 3,000 4,000 square foot standalone building suitable for restaurants, or
if the site characteristics otherwise met our criteria, larger sites where we would be able to construct multi-tenant buildings, where
we would be able to occupy a portion of the space with a Bad Daddy s restaurant and lease other portions of the building to restaurant
or non-restaurant tenants. 

All of the restaurants are regularly maintained by our repair
and maintenance staff as well as by outside contractors, when necessary. We believe that all of our properties are in good condition and
that there will be a need for periodic capital expenditures to maintain the operational and aesthetic integrity of our properties for
the foreseeable future, including recurring maintenance and periodic capital improvements. All of our properties are covered up to replacement
cost under our property and casualty insurance policies and in the opinion of management are adequately covered by insurance. 

ITEM 3. 
 LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 

As previously disclosed in the Company s Form 10-K for
the fiscal year ended September 29, 2020, the Company is the defendant in a lawsuit styled as White Winston Select Asset Funds, LLC and
GT Acquisition Group, Inc. v. Good Times Restaurants, Inc., arising from the failed negotiations between plaintiffs and the Company for
the sale of the Good Times Drive Thru subsidiary to plaintiffs. The lawsuit was initially filed on September 24, 2019 in Delaware Chancery
Court, and Company removed the case to federal court in the US District Court for the District of Delaware on November 5, 2019. On July
30, 2021, the plaintiffs moved the Court for leave to amend their complaint and add new causes of action and a claim for 18 million in
damages. On August 31, 2021, the Company s retained damages expert submitted a report in response to the plaintiffs claims
for damages. Good Times contends that the most reasonable estimation of damages is between 332,000 and 3.3 million. The estimate assumes
a finding of liability in favor of the plaintiffs and their ability to satisfy the legal standards for proving damages. The Company views
these events as not probable. On October 25, 2021, the Court granted the plaintiffs leave to amend their complaint and add new causes
of action and damages. The Company will continue to vigorously pursue a full defense of this matter on the merits. Because the Company
has concluded that a loss is not probable, we therefore have not recorded a liability related to the litigation. The Company will continue
to evaluate this matter based on new information as it becomes available. We are otherwise subject, from time to time, to various lawsuits
in the normal course of business. These lawsuits are not expected to have a material impact on us.

ITEM 5. 
 MARKET FOR REGISTRANT S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED SHAREHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY
 SECURITIES. 

Shares of our Common Stock are listed for trading on the NASDAQ
Capital Market under the symbol GTIM . As of December 15, 2020, there were approximately 47 holders of record of our common
stock. Because many shares of our common stock are held by brokers and other institutions on behalf of shareholders, we are unable
to estimate the total number of shareholders represented by these holders of record. 

Dividend Policy 

We have never paid dividends on our common stock and
do not anticipate paying dividends in the foreseeable future. In addition, we have obtained financing under loan agreements that restrict
the payment of dividends. Our ability to pay future dividends will necessarily depend on our earnings and financial condition. However,
since restaurant development is capital intensive, we currently intend to retain any earnings for that purpose. 

Recent Sales of Unregistered Securities 

None.

Tender Offer 

On August 13, 2021, the Company commenced a tender offer (the
 Tender Offer to purchase up to 1,413,000 shares of its common stock at a price per share of 4.60. On September 10, 2021,
at 11:59pm, the offer expired, and the Company subsequently accepted for payment, at a purchase price of 4.60 per share, a total of 333,241
shares properly tendered and not properly withdrawn before the expiration date, at an aggregate cost of approximately 1,532,908, excluding
fees and expenses relating to the Tender Offer.

 MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition
and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere
in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Overview 

Please see Item 1 Business-Recent Developments 
for a discussion regarding the impact of, and the Company s actions taken in response to, the COVID-19 pandemic on our business. 

We operate as two reportable business segments:
Good Times Burgers and Frozen Custard restaurants Good Times and Bad Daddy s Burger Bar restaurants Bad
Daddy s ). All of our Good Times restaurants compete in the quick service drive-thru segment of the restaurant industry while
our Bad Daddy s restaurants compete in the full-service casual dining segment of the restaurant industry. We believe that providing
this additional financial information for each of our brands will provide a better understanding of our overall operating results. Refer
to Note 10, Segment Reporting , in the notes to our consolidated financial statements for more information. 

The Company s fiscal year is a 52/53-week year ending
on the last Tuesday of September. In a 52-week fiscal year, each of the Company s quarterly periods comprise 13 weeks. The additional
week in a 53-week fiscal year is added to the first quarter, making such quarter consist of 14 weeks. Fiscal 2020 had a quarter with 14
weeks. Our discussion for fiscal years 2021 and 2020, which ended on September 28, 2021 and September 29, 2020, respectively, cover periods
of 52 full calendar weeks in fiscal 2021 and 53 full calendar weeks in fiscal 2020.

Bad Daddy s Restaurants : 

We currently operate forty company-owned and joint-venture
Bad Daddy s restaurants. We also license one restaurant in North Carolina and have a franchise restaurant in South Carolina. We
expect to open no more than two additional Bad Daddy s restaurants during fiscal 2022. Due to the unusual rate of inflation of our
raw products, we cannot, at this time, reasonably predict our expected price increases during fiscal 2022 at our Bad Daddy s restaurants. 

Good Times Burgers Frozen Custard Restaurants : 

We currently operate twenty-four company-owned and joint-venture
Good Times restaurants all in the state of Colorado. In addition, we have eight Good Times franchise restaurants, six operating in Colorado
and two in Wyoming. 

Due to the unusual rate of inflation of our raw products, we
cannot at this time reasonably predict our expected price increases during fiscal 2022 at our Good Times restaurants. We are continuing
to manage our marketing communications to balance growth in customer traffic and the average customer expenditure. 

Impact of Inflation at Both Concepts 

Commodity prices, particularly for key proteins have recently
been at near-record highs and have exhibited extreme volatility. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 we experienced meaningful price
inflation which has continued into our first quarter of 2022. We are experiencing price inflation in most goods, including paper and packaging,
other restaurant supplies, and energy (utilities) costs. 

In addition to food cost inflation, we have also experienced
the need to meaningfully increase wages to attract workers in our restaurants. While we are hopeful that wage rate inflation moderates,
the persistent shortage of qualified workers, rather than statutory wage rate increases, which have traditionally created rate pressure,
is the primary factor creating upward pressure on wages, as demand for labor is currently significantly exceeding the supply of qualified
workers.

 Table of Contents 

We have historically used menu price increases to manage profitability
in times of inflation, however the current unusually high rate of inflation, both of goods and labor, exceeds what we believe we can reasonably
pass through to our customers without negatively affecting frequency and trial by our customers. 

Same Store Sales 

Same store sales for each brand represents the comparison of
restaurant sales in the current year, to the same comparable weeks in the immediately preceding fiscal year for those stores open for
at least 18 months. Same store sales is a commonly used metric in the restaurant industry and management believes it is an indicator of
strength of a brand and its existing restaurant locations. Further, management believes that by excluding growth achieved through new
unit development, same store sales provides a metric that measures organic growth within the Company s existing restaurants. 

Results of Operations for Fiscal 2021 Compared to Fiscal 2020 

Net Revenues: Net revenues for fiscal 2021 increased
 14,094,000 (12.8 to 123,953,000 from 109,859,000 for fiscal 2020. Bad Daddy s concept revenues increased 12,306,000 while
our Good Times concept revenues increased 1,788,000. 

Bad Daddy s restaurant sales increased 12,279,000 to
 88,595,000 in fiscal 2021 from 76,316,000 in fiscal 2020. Sales were positively impacted by two new restaurants opened in fiscal 2021
and two new restaurants opened in the first fiscal quarter of 2020 and the impact of rolling over fiscal year 2020 dining room closures
due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This was offset by the impact of the 53 rd week of the fiscal year in fiscal 2020, which we estimate
to be approximately 2,015,000. Bad Daddy s same store restaurant sales increased 18.2 during fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020,
substantially driven by decreases between March and May of 2020 when dining rooms were closed, and to a lesser extent in June of 2020
when dining rooms were open but at reduced capacity. Indoor dining rooms in Colorado were also closed between November of 2020 and January
of 2021, and most dining rooms operated at reduced capacity through May 2021. Bad Daddy s restaurants are included in same store
sales after they have been open a full eighteen months. The average menu price increase was 3.1 in 2021 over 2020. There were thirty-seven
restaurants included in the same store sales base at the end of the fiscal year. Additionally, net revenues for fiscal 2021 were increased
by 27,000 in higher franchise royalties and license fees compared to the prior fiscal year, primarily related to the Charlotte Airport
licensee. Fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020 include franchise advertising contributions of 15,000 and 13,000, respectively.

Good Times restaurant sales increased 1,701,000 to 34,463,000
in fiscal 2021 from 32,763,000 in fiscal 2020. Same store restaurant sales increased 10.5 during fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020
despite the extra operating week in the first fiscal quarter of 2020, which we estimate contributed approximately 460,000. Restaurant
sales increased 3,264,000 from the prior year due to the same store sales increase resulting from increased customer preference for drive-thru
service. One restaurant closed during each of fiscal 2021 and 2020 and were excluded from same store sales. The average menu price increase
in fiscal 2021 over fiscal 2020 was approximately 5.5 . Additionally, net revenues for fiscal 2021 were increased by 88,000 in higher
franchise revenues compared to fiscal 2020. Fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020 include franchise advertising contributions of 263,000 and 231,000,
respectively. 

Average Good Times restaurant sales for company-operated restaurants
open the entire fiscal year for fiscal 2021 and 2020 were as follows:

During fiscal 2021, company-operated Good Times restaurants 
sales for restaurants that had been open a full eighteen months ranged from a low of 761,000 to a high of 2,174,000. 

Food and Packaging Costs: For fiscal 2021, food and packaging
costs increased 3,565,000 from 32,599,000 (29.4 of restaurant sales) in fiscal 2020 to 36,164,000 (29.9 of restaurant sales). 

Bad Daddy s food and packaging costs were 26,123,000
(29.5 of restaurant sales) in fiscal 2021, up from 22,527,000 (29.5 of restaurant sales) in fiscal 2020. This increase is primarily
attributable to higher restaurant sales during the current fiscal year versus prior fiscal year.

 Table of Contents 

Good Times food and packaging costs were 10,041,000 (29.1 
of restaurant sales) in fiscal 2021, down slightly from 10,072,000 (30.7 of restaurant sales) in fiscal 2020. This decrease as a percent
of sales is due primarily to the impact of an 5.5 increase in menu pricing, which offset purchase price increases on our primary ingredients. 

Payroll and Other Employee Benefit Costs: For fiscal
2021, payroll and other employee benefit costs increased 2,287,000 from 38,762,000 (35.5 of restaurant sales) in fiscal 2020 to 41,049,000
(33.4 of restaurant sales). 

Bad Daddy s payroll and other employee benefit costs were
 30,058,000 (33.9 of restaurant sales) for fiscal 2021, up from 27,790,000 (36.4 of restaurant sales) in fiscal 2020. The 2,268,000
increase was primarily attributable to higher restaurant sales during the current fiscal year versus the prior fiscal year. As a percent
of sales, payroll and employee benefits costs decreased by 2.5 primarily attributable to the leveraging of higher sales and staffing
reductions associated with the closure of our Colorado dining rooms from late November 2020 through early January 2021, offset by pay
rate increases for hourly employees in the current year and staffing reductions associated with dining room closures in the prior year. 

Good Times payroll and other employee benefit costs were 10,991,000
(31.9 of restaurant sales) in fiscal 2021, up slightly from 10,971,000 (33.5 of restaurant sales) in fiscal 2020. As a percent of sales,
payroll and employee benefits costs decreased by 1.6 in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020. This decrease is primarily attributable
to the leveraging impact of sales and price increases, offset by pay rate increases for hourly employees in the current year. 

Occupancy Costs: Occupancy costs include rent, real and
personal property taxes, common area maintenance expenses, licenses and insurance expense. For fiscal 2021, occupancy costs decreased
 109,000 from 8,877,000 (8.1 of restaurant sales) in fiscal 2021 to 8,815,000 (7.2 of restaurant sales). 

Bad Daddy s occupancy costs were 5,960,000 (6.7 of restaurant
sales) for fiscal 2021, down from 6,025,000 (7.9 of restaurant sales) in fiscal 2020. The 113,000 decrease was primarily attributable
to reduced personal property taxes and reduced rent on one Colorado location related to the COVID-19 pandemic. The decrease as a percentage
of sales was due to the leveraging effect of increased restaurant sales. 

Good Times occupancy costs were 2,855,000 (8.3 of restaurant
sales) in fiscal 2021, up slightly from 2,852,000 (8.7 of restaurant sales) in fiscal 2020. The decrease as a percentage of sales was
due to the closure of one restaurant in the first quarter of fiscal 2021, as well as the leveraging effect of increased restaurant sales. 

Other Operating Costs: For fiscal 2021, other operating
costs increased 2,763,000 from 12,148,000 (11.1 of restaurant sales) in fiscal 2020 to 14,911,000 (12.1 of restaurant sales). 

Bad Daddy s other operating costs were 11,643,000 (13.1 
of restaurant sales) for fiscal 2021, up from 9,206,000 (12.1 of restaurant sales) in fiscal 2020. The 2,438,000 increase was partially
attributable to the two new restaurants opened in fiscal 2020 and two new restaurants opened in the third and fourth fiscal quarter of
2021. The increase was attributable to significantly reduced sales in the third and fourth fiscal quarters of the prior year and a 1,407,000
increase in commissions paid to delivery service providers in the current fiscal year compared to the prior fiscal year. The percentage
increase was primarily attributable to the significant shift in delivery sales as a percentage of overall sales throughout the COVID-19
pandemic. 

Good Times other operating costs were 3,268,000 (9.5 of restaurant
sales) in fiscal 2021, up from 2,942,000 (9.0 of restaurant sales) in fiscal 2020. The increase was primarily attributable to an approximate
 119,000 increase in commissions paid to delivery service providers. 

New Store Preopening Costs: For fiscal 2021, we incurred
 766,000 of preopening costs compared to 1,031,000 in fiscal 2020. All of the preopening costs are related to our Bad Daddy s restaurants. 

Preopening costs in the current fiscal year are attributable
to two restaurants that opened in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2021. Preopening costs in the prior fiscal year were primarily
attributable to two restaurants that opened late during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, two restaurants that opened during the first
fiscal quarter of 2020, and approximately 157,000 of non-cash operating lease costs associated with the two restaurants that opened in
fiscal 2021. Preopening costs typically occur over a period of approximately five months; however, due to COVID-19 pandemic-related delays,
the two restaurants opened in fiscal 2021 incurred preopening costs for approximately 15 months. Although the exact timing varies by location,
we typically spend approximately 275,000 to 350,000 per location. 

Depreciation and Amortization Costs: Depreciation and
amortization includes depreciation on capital expenditures for restaurants and corporate assets as well as amortization of acquired franchise
rights and leasehold interests. For fiscal 2021, depreciation and amortization costs decreased 287,000 from 4,129,000 in fiscal 2020
to 3,842,000 in fiscal 2021. 

Bad Daddy s depreciation costs decreased 205,000 from
 3,268,000 in fiscal 2020 to 3,064,000 in fiscal 2021. This decrease was attributable to reduced depreciation resulting from asset impairment
charges recorded in the second quarter of fiscal 2020, offset by the two new restaurants opened in fiscal 2021. 

Good Times depreciation costs decreased 83,000 from 861,000
in fiscal 2020 to 778,000 in fiscal 2021.

General and Administrative Costs: General and administrative
costs include all corporate and administrative functions. Components of this category include corporate, regional and franchise support
salaries and benefits; professional and consulting fees; travel; corporate information systems; training; board of directors expenses;
office rent; and legal expenses. For fiscal 2021, general and administrative costs increased 2,658,000 from 6,779,000 (6.2 of total
revenues) in fiscal 2020 to 9,437,000 (7.6 of total revenue). 

The 2,658,000 increase in general and administrative expenses
in fiscal 2021 is primarily attributable to: 

Increase of 1,520,000 in professional services primarily related
 to increased legal fees 

Increase of 632,000 in administrative related payroll and benefit
 costs primarily related to a 471,000 increase in underwriting losses/excess claims costs on the Company s partially self-insured
 health care plan and increased estimated incentive compensation over the prior year including a one-time bonus paid to the Company s
 CEO in December 2020 in connection with the renegotiation of his employment contract 

Increase of 222,000 related to business insurance premiums 

Increase in costs associated with district management of 142,000
 primarily related to increased estimated performance-based bonus provisions 

Increase of 139,000 in computer and technology costs 

Increase of 133,000 in travel and entertainment related costs

Increase of 79,000 in incentive stock compensation primarily related
 to options and restricted stock units granted to our Directors and Chief Executive Officer in connection with the renegotiation of his
 employment contract 

Decrease of 65,000 in preliminary site costs 

Decrease of 63,000 in corporate lease expenses 

Increase of 59,000 in payroll processing fees associated with
 a vendor transition 

Increase of 44,000 in director s fees 

Net decreases in all other expenses of 184,000 

We expect general and administrative costs to continue to increase
slightly from fiscal 2021 to fiscal 2022 due to increased insurance and health costs, and as we make investments in new human resource
and financial management systems. 

Advertising Costs: For fiscal 2021, advertising costs
increased 88,000 from 1,993,000 (1.8 of total revenues) in fiscal 2020 to 2,082,000 (1.7 of total revenues). 

Bad Daddy s advertising costs decreased 81,000 from 848,000
(1.1 of total revenues) in fiscal 2020 to 767,000 (0.9 of total revenues) in fiscal 2021. Bad Daddy s advertising costs consist
primarily of menu development, printing costs, local store marketing and social media. All restaurants contribute to an advertising materials
fund based on a percentage of restaurant sales. The current and prior years include advertising costs of 15,000 and 13,000, respectively,
associated with franchise advertising contributions. 

We anticipate that in fiscal 2022 Bad Daddy s advertising
costs as a percentage of total revenues will remain consistent with fiscal 2021. 

Good Times advertising costs increased 169,000 from 1,145,000
(3.4 of total revenues) in fiscal 2020 to 1,314,000 (3.7 of total revenues) in fiscal 2021. Good Times advertising costs consists primarily
of contributions made to the advertising materials fund and a regional advertising cooperative based on a percentage of restaurant sales
which are used to provide radio advertising, social media, on-site and point-of-purchase materials. The percentage contribution paid to
the regional advertising cooperative was reduced at the start of the current fiscal year associated with a change in expected media mix.
Advertising costs are presented gross, with franchisee contributions to the fund being recognized as a component of franchise revenues. 

We anticipate that in fiscal 2022 Good Times advertising costs
as a percentage of net revenues will remain relatively stable, between approximately 3.0 and 3.5 . 

Franchise Costs: For fiscal 2021, franchise costs increased
 7,000 from 20,000 in fiscal 2020 to 27,000 in fiscal 2021. The costs are primarily related to the Good Times franchised restaurants. 

Gain or Loss on Restaurant Asset Disposals: For fiscal
2021, the gain on restaurant asset disposals was 37,000 compared to a gain of 45,000 in fiscal 2020. The gain in both fiscal 2021 and
2020 is primarily comprised of a deferred gain on previous sale lease-back transactions related to two Good Times restaurants, as well
as a gain of 8,000 related to the sale of miscellaneous restaurant equipment in fiscal 2020. 

Long-lived Asset Impairment Charges: There were no asset
impairment charges in fiscal 2021. In fiscal 2020, asset impairment charges were 5,606,000. We review long-lived assets and intangibles
subject to amortization for impairment when there are factors that indicate the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable. 

Based upon the analysis we performed at March 31, 2020, we identified
five restaurants where the expected future cash flows would not be sufficient to recover the carrying value of the associated assets.
The restaurants are all Bad Daddy s restaurants. We recorded non-cash charges of 4,359,000 related to the impairment of these restaurants
during the quarter ended March 31, 2020. 

29 

 Table of Contents 

Based upon the analysis we performed at June 30, 2020, we identified
one additional Bad Daddy s restaurant where the expected future cash flows would not be sufficient to recover the carrying value
of the associated assets and recorded non-cash charges of 932,000 related to the impairment of this restaurant during the quarter ending
June 30, 2020. 

Given the results of our analysis at September 29, 2020, we
identified one additional Good Times restaurant where the expected future cash flows would not be sufficient to recover the carrying value
of the associated assets and recorded non-cash charges of 315,000 related to the impairment of this restaurant during the quarter ending
September 29, 2020. 

Goodwill Impairment Charges: We review goodwill for impairment
on an annual basis or whenever indications of impairment arise. During fiscal 2021, no goodwill impairment charges were deemed necessary.
In the second quarter of fiscal 2020, we recorded goodwill impairment of 10,000,000. 

In March 2020, the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic prompted
authorities in most jurisdictions where we operate to issue stay-at-home orders, leading to an unexpected significant disruption to our
business requiring us to close restaurant dining rooms and operate Bad Daddy s restaurants under a delivery and carry-out model.
As such, the consequences of the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic coupled with a sustained decline in our stock price were determined
to be indicators of impairment for our Bad Daddy s reporting unit. As such, using Level 3 inputs, we performed a quantitative goodwill
impairment assessment using both the discounted cash flow method and guideline public company method to determine the fair value of this
reporting unit. Significant assumptions and estimates used in determining fair value include future revenues, operating costs, working
capital changes, capital expenditures, and a discount rate that approximates the weighted average cost of capital. Based on the quantitative
assessment, we determined that the fair value of this reporting unit was less than its carrying value and recognized a non-cash goodwill
impairment charge of 10.0 million, equal to the excess of the Bad Daddy s reporting unit's carrying value above its fair value.
No goodwill impairment charges were recognized related to goodwill attributable to the Good Times reporting unit. 

Income (Loss) from Operations: Income from operations
was 6,897,000 in fiscal 2021 compared to a loss from operations of 12,041,000 in fiscal 2020. 

The change from fiscal 2020 to fiscal 2021 was primarily attributable
to the increase in net revenues and a decrease in asset and goodwill impairment costs and other changes discussed in the Restaurant
Operating Costs , New Store Preopening Costs , General and Administrative Costs , Advertising Costs ,
 Franchise Costs , and Gain on Restaurant Asset Disposals sections above. 

Gain on Debt Extinguishment: Gain on debt extinguishment
in fiscal 2021 was 11,778,000. This gain is related to forgiveness of PPP loans by the SBA. The breakdown of the forgiveness amount by
operating segment is as follows: 

Bad Daddy s

There was no gain on debt extinguishment in fiscal 2020. 

Net Income (Loss): The net income was 18,406,000 for
fiscal 2021 compared to a net loss of 12,794,000 in fiscal 2020. The change from fiscal 2020 to fiscal 2021 was primarily attributable
to the matters discussed in the Net Revenues , Food and Packaging Costs , Payroll and Other Employee Benefits
Costs, General and Administrative Costs , Long-lived Asset Impairment Charges and Goodwill Impairment
Charges sections above. 

Income Attributable to Non-Controlling Interests: For
fiscal 2021, the income attributable to non-controlling interests was 1,613,000 compared to 1,122,000 in fiscal 2020. The non-controlling
interest represents the limited partner s share of income in the Good Times and Bad Daddy s joint-venture restaurants. 822,000
of the current year income is attributable to the Bad Daddy s joint-venture restaurants, compared to 493,000 in the prior year.
 791,000 of the current year income is attributable to the Good Times joint-venture restaurants, compared to 629,000 in the prior year. 

Adjusted EBITDA 

EBITDA is defined as net income (loss) before interest, income taxes and depreciation
and amortization. 

Adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA, adjusted for non-cash
stock-based compensation expense, preopening expense, non-recurring acquisition costs, U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles GAAP rent in excess of cash rent, non-cash disposal of assets and non-cash asset impairment charges. Adjusted EBITDA is intended as a supplemental
measure of our performance that is not required by or presented in accordance with GAAP. We believe that EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA provide
useful information to management and investors regarding certain financial and business trends relating to our financial condition and
operating results. Our management uses EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA (i) as a factor in evaluating management's performance when determining
incentive compensation and (ii) to evaluate the effectiveness of our business strategies. 

30 

 Table of Contents 

We believe that the use of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA provides
an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing the Company's financial measures
with other restaurants, which may present similar non-GAAP financial measures to investors. In addition, you should be aware when evaluating
EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA that in the future we may incur expenses similar to those excluded when calculating these measures. Our presentation
of these measures should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items.
Our computation of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures computed by other companies, because all companies
do not calculate Adjusted EBITDA in the same fashion. 

Our management does not consider EBITDA or Adjusted EBITDA in
isolation or as an alternative to financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP. The principal limitation of EBITDA and Adjusted
EBITDA is that they exclude significant expenses and income that are required by GAAP to be recorded in the Company's financial statements.
Some of these limitations are: 

Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect our cash
 expenditures, or future requirements, for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; 

Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes
 in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; 

Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the interest
 expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments, on our debts; 

Although depreciation and amortization are
 non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA does not
 reflect any cash requirements for such replacements; 

Stock based compensation expense is and will
 remain a key element of our overall long-term incentive compensation package, although we exclude it as an expense when evaluating our
 ongoing performance for a particular period; 

Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the impact
 of certain cash charges resulting from matters we consider not to be indicative of our ongoing operations; and 

Other companies in our industry may calculate
 Adjusted EBITDA differently than we do, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure. 

Because of these limitations, Adjusted EBITDA should not be
considered in isolation or as a substitute for performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. We compensate for these limitations
by relying primarily on our GAAP results and using Adjusted EBITDA only as a supplementary measure. You should review the reconciliation
of net income (loss) to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA below and not rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Please see Item 1 Business-Recent Developments for a discussion
of the COVID-19 pandemic s impact on our liquidity. 

Cash and Working Capital: As of September 28, 2021, we
had a working capital deficit of 1,442,000. Our working capital position benefits from the fact that we generally collect cash from sales
to customers the same day, or in the case of credit or debit card transactions, within a few days of the related sale. Although we have
two to four weeks to pay many of our vendors, we currently are paying our primary foodservice vendors on 1-3 day payment terms to take
advantage of early pay discounts. Our current working capital deficit is largely caused by the recognition of short term lease liabilities,
as we lease substantially all of our real estate and have both current- and long-term obligations to our landlords. We believe that we
will have sufficient capital to meet our working capital, and recurring capital expenditure needs in fiscal 2022. As of September 28,
2021, we had no commitments outstanding. We anticipate any commitments in fiscal 2022 will be funded out of existing cash or future borrowings
against the Cadence Credit Facility. 

Financing 

Cadence Credit Facility: The Company maintains a credit
agreement with Cadence Bank Cadence pursuant to which, as amended, Cadence agreed to loan the Company up to 8,000,000
with a maturity date of January 31, 2023 (the Cadence Credit Facility ). As amended by the various amendments, the Cadence
Credit Facility accrues commitment fees on the daily unused balance of the facility at a rate of 0.25 . As of September 28, 2021, any
borrowings under the Cadence Credit Facility, as amended, bear interest at a variable rate based upon the Company s election of
(i) 2.5 plus the base rate, which is the highest of the (a) Federal Funds Rate plus 0.5 , (b) the Cadence bank publicly-announced prime
rate, and (c) LIBOR plus 1.0 , or (ii) LIBOR, with a 0.250 floor, plus 3.5 . Interest is due at the end of each calendar quarter if the
Company selects to pay interest based on the base rate and at the end of each LIBOR period if it selects to pay interest based on LIBOR.
During the fiscal year ended September 28, 2021, the weighted average interest rate applicable to borrowings under the Cadence Credit
Facility was 3.75 . 

The Cadence Credit Facility, as amended, contains certain affirmative
and negative covenants and events of default that the Company considers customary for an agreement of this type, including covenants setting
a maximum leverage ratio of 5.15:1, a minimum pre-distribution fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.25:1, a minimum post-distribution fixed
charge coverage ratio of 1.10:1 and minimum liquidity of 2.0 million. As of September 28, 2021, the Company was in compliance with all
financial covenants under the Cadence Credit Facility. 

As a result of entering into the Cadence Credit Facility and
the various amendments, the Company paid loan origination costs including professional fees of approximately 308,500 and is amortizing
these costs over the term of the credit agreement. 

The obligations under the Cadence Credit Facility are collateralized
by a first-priority lien on substantially all of the Company s assets. 

As of September 28, 2021, there were no outstanding borrowings
against the facility. Availability of the Cadence Credit Facility for borrowings is reduced by the outstanding face value of any letters
of credit issued under the facility. As of September 28, 2021, the outstanding face value of such letters of credit was 157,500. 

Paycheck Protection Program Loans: On May 7, 2020, Good
Times and three of its wholly-owned subsidiaries, BDI, Drive Thru, and BDC (each a Borrower ), entered into unsecured loans
in the aggregate principal amount of 11,645,000 (the Loans with Cadence Bank, N.A. (the Lender pursuant
to the PPP. 

In June 2021, the SBA approved forgiveness in full of the Loans,
including accrued interest, in the aggregate amount of 11,778,226, which was recognized as gain on debt extinguishment in the fiscal
year ended September 28, 2021. The principal and accrued interest balance on each of these Loans is now zero, as of the forgiveness date
specific to each of the Company s and its subsidiaries Loans. 

Total interest expense on notes payable and capital leases was
 269,000 and 755,000 for fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020, respectively.

Cash Flows: Net cash provided by operating activities
was 9,145,000 for fiscal 2021 compared to net cash provided by operating activities of 8,369,000 in fiscal 2020. The net cash provided
by operating activities for fiscal 2021 was the result of net income of 18,400,000 offset by non-cash reconciling items totaling 9,145,000.
These reconciling items are comprised of 1) depreciation and amortization of general assets of 3,992,000, 2) amortization of operating
lease assets of 3,515,000, 3) stock-based compensation expense of 362,000, 4) gain on debt forgiveness of 11,778,000, 5) deferred gain
on the sale of assets of 37,000, 6) an increase in receivables and other assets of 604,000, 7) an increase in deferred liabilities and
accrued expenses of 440,000, 8) a decrease in accounts payable of 1,389,000 and 9) a net decrease in amounts related to our operating
leases of 3,762,000, and a provision for income taxes of 6,000. 

Net cash used in investing activities in fiscal
2021 was 3,185,000 compared to net cash used in investing activities of 2,529,000 in fiscal 2020. Fiscal 2021 activity primarily reflects
the purchases of property and equipment of 3,198,000. Purchases of property and equipment were comprised of the following: 

1,862,000 in costs for the development of Bad Daddy s locations 

828,000 for miscellaneous capital expenditures related to our
 Bad Daddy s restaurants 

331,000 for miscellaneous capital expenditures related to our
 Good Times restaurants 

177,000 for miscellaneous capital expenditures related to our
 corporate office 

Net cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2021 was 8,558,000
compared to net cash provided by financing activities of 2,869,000 in fiscal 2020. The fiscal 2021 activity is comprised of principal
payments on notes payable and long-term debt of 5,500,000, the purchase of common stock in the Tender Offer equal to 1,533,000 in the
aggregate, proceeds from the exercise of stock options equal to 440,000, contributions from non-controlling interests of 20,000 and
distributions to non-controlling interests of 1,985,000. 

Contingencies and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements: We
remain contingently liable on various leases underlying restaurants that were previously sold to franchisees. We have never experienced
any losses related to these contingent lease liabilities, however if a franchisee defaults on the payments under the leases, we would
be liable for the lease payments as the assignor or sub-lessor of the lease. Currently we have not been notified nor are we aware of any
leases in default by the franchisees, however there can be no assurance that there will not be in the future which could have a material
effect on our future operating results. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates: Our consolidated
financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with GAAP. Preparing consolidated financial statements requires
us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses. These estimates and
assumptions are affected by the application of our accounting policies. Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to
our Consolidated Financial Statements. Critical accounting estimates are those that require application of management s most difficult,
subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods. While
we apply our judgment based on assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, actual results could vary from these assumptions.
Additionally, in the context of the ongoing global COVID-19 pandemic, future facts and circumstances could change and impact our estimates
and assumptions. It is possible that materially different amounts would be reported using different assumptions. The following is a description
of what we consider to be our most significant accounting policies. 

Leases: The
Company determines if a contract contains a lease at inception. The Company's material long-term operating lease agreements are for the
land and buildings for our restaurants as well as our corporate office. The initial lease terms range from 10 years to 20 years, most
of which include renewal options of 10 to 15 years. The lease term is generally the minimum of the noncancelable period or the lease term
including renewal options which are reasonably certain of being exercised up to a term of approximately 20 years. 

Operating lease assets and liabilities are recognized at the
lease commencement date for material leases with a term of greater than 12 months. Operating lease liabilities represent the present value
of future minimum lease payments. Since our leases do not provide an implicit rate, our operating lease liabilities are calculated using
our estimated incremental borrowing rate based on a collateralized borrowing over the term of each individual lease. Minimum lease payments
include only fixed lease components of the agreement, as well as variable rate payments that depend on an index, initially measured using
the index at the lease commencement date. 

Operating lease assets represent our right to use an underlying
asset and are based upon the operating lease liabilities adjusted for prepaid or accrued lease payments, initial direct costs and lease
incentives. Lease incentives are recognized when earned and reduce our operating lease asset related to the lease. They are amortized
through the operating lease assets as reductions of rent expense over the lease term. 

33 

 Table of Contents 

Operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis
over the lease term. Certain of the Company s operating leases contain clauses that provide for contingent rent based on a percentage
of sales greater than certain specified target amounts. Variable lease payments that do not depend on a rate or index, escalation in the
index subsequent to the initial measurement, payments associated with non-lease components such as common area maintenance, real estate
taxes and insurance, and short-term lease payments (leases with a term with 12 months or less) are expensed as incurred or when the achievement
of the specified target that triggers the contingent rent is considered probable. During the fiscal year ended September 28, 2021 the
Company incurred 71,000 of contingent rent. 

Some of the leases provide for base rent, plus additional rent
based on gross sales, as defined in each lease agreement. The Company is also generally obligated to pay certain real estate taxes, insurance
and common area maintenance charges, and various other expenses related to properties, which are expensed as incurred. 

Employee Medical Plans :
We sponsor health and welfare plans that provides medical insurance benefits to certain of our employees. We partially self-insure against
claims made by participants in this plan and maintain coverage above a certain threshold for claims against individual claimants within
a plan year (the stop loss limit ). Prior to each plan year, we underwrite the plans based upon their then-current membership
and estimate aggregate claims costs for the next plan year for each plan on a per-member average basis. Estimated costs (net of any employee
contribution) are recognized as part of restaurant labor for restaurant employees. Estimated costs (net of any employee contribution)
for non-restaurant employees are recognized as part of General and Administrative expenses. During the year, we periodically review claims
costs against estimates made prior to the inception of the plan year. Significant differences between actual and estimated claims activity underwriting losses or underwriting gains are recognized as part of General and Administrative expenses.
Due to the relatively small number of members in the plans, should we have a significant number of members with high cost claims in any
given year, we may experience significant underwriting losses. 

Non-controlling Interests : 
Non-controlling interests are presented as a separate item in the equity section of the consolidated balance sheet. Consolidated net income
or loss attributable to non-controlling interests are presented on the face of the consolidated statement of operations. Additionally,
changes in a parent s ownership interest in a subsidiary that do not result in deconsolidation are equity transactions, and that
deconsolidation of a subsidiary is recorded as a gain or loss based on the fair value on the deconsolidation date. 

Income Taxes : 
We account for income taxes under the liability method whereby deferred tax asset and liability account balances are determined based
on differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and
laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. We provide a valuation allowance, if necessary, to reduce deferred
tax assets to their estimated realizable value. We continually review the realizability of our deferred tax assets, including an analysis
of factors such as future taxable income, reversal of existing taxable temporary differences, and tax planning strategies. We assessed
whether a valuation allowance should be recorded against our deferred tax assets based on consideration of all available evidence, using
a more likely than not standard. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we considered both positive and negative
evidence related to the likelihood of realization of deferred tax assets. In making such assessment, more weight was given to evidence
that could be objectively verified, including recent cumulative losses. Future sources of taxable income were also considered in determining
the amount of the recorded valuation allowance. Based on our review of this evidence, we determined that a full valuation allowance against
all of our deferred tax assets was appropriate. As we increase earnings and utilize deferred tax assets in the future, it is possible
the valuation allowance could be reduced or eliminated. 

The Company is subject to U.S. federal income tax and income
tax in multiple U.S. state jurisdictions. The Company continues to remain subject to examination by federal authorities and state jurisdictions
generally for fiscal years after 2017. The Company believes that its income tax filings positions and deductions will be sustained on
audit and does not anticipate any adjustments that will result in a material adverse effect on the Company s financial condition,
results of operations, or cash flows. Therefore, no reserves for uncertain income tax positions have been recorded. The Company s
practice is to recognize interest and/or penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense. We have accrued 0 for interest
and penalties as of September 28, 2021. 

Variable
Interest Entities : Once an entity is determined to be a Variable Interest Entity (VIE), the party with the controlling financial
interest, the primary beneficiary, is required to consolidate it. We previously had three
franchisees with notes payable and after analysis we had determined that, while the franchisees were VIE s, we are not the primary
beneficiary of the entities, and therefore they are not required to be consolidated. We no longer have any notes receivable from any of
our franchisees.

 CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Conclusion Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls
and Procedures: Based on an evaluation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and
15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act), the Company s Chief Executive Officer (its principal executive officer and principal financial officer)
has concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report. 

Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting: Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined
in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act). We maintain a system of internal controls that is designed to provide reasonable
assurance in a cost-effective manner as to the fair and reliable preparation and presentation of the consolidated financial statements. 

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial
reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable
assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. 

Our management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness
of our internal control over financial reporting as of September 28, 2021. In making this evaluation, our management used the criteria
set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO in Internal Control-Integrated
Framework (2013). This evaluation included a review of the documentation of controls, evaluation of the design effectiveness of controls
and a conclusion on this evaluation. Based on this assessment, our management concluded that, as of September 28, 2021, the Company s
internal control over financial reporting was effective based on these criteria. 

This Annual Report does not include an attestation report of
our registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management s report was not
subject to attestation by our registered public accounting firm pursuant to rules of the SEC that permit us to provide only management s
report in this Annual Report. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting: There
have been no significant changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the Company s
fourth quarter for the fiscal year ended September 28, 2021 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect,
the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
 To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of 
 Good Times Restaurants Inc. and Subsidiaries 
 Opinion on the Financial Statements 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Good Times Restaurants Inc. and Subsidiaries (the Company as of September 28, 2021 and September 29, 2020, the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders equity and cash flows for the years then ended, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements ). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of the Company as of September 28, 2021 and September 29, 2020, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
 Basis for Opinion 
 These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 
 Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures to respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 Critical Audit Matters 
 Critical audit matters are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. We determined that there are no critical audit matters.

 We have served as the Company s auditor since 2017.

 While we believe that we will continue to have adequate working capital to meet our current needs, should business decline significantly, we would not likely choose to, and we may not be able to, take some of the same actions as we took during fiscal 2020 to increase our liquidity as they would negatively impact the long-term performance of the business.

Bad Daddy s 

Total 

In March 2020, the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic prompted authorities in most jurisdictions where the Company operates to issue stay-at-home orders, leading to an unexpected significant disruption to the Company s business requiring the Company to close its restaurant dining rooms and operate its Bad Daddy s restaurants under a delivery and carry-out model. As such, the consequences of the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic coupled with a sustained decline in the Company s stock price were determined to be indicators of impairment for its Bad Daddy s reporting unit. As such, using Level 3 inputs, the Company performed a quantitative goodwill impairment assessment using both the discounted cash flow method and guideline public company method to determine the fair value of its reporting unit. Significant assumptions and estimates used in determining fair value include future revenues, operating costs, working capital changes, capital expenditures, and a discount rate that approximates the Company s weighted average cost of capital. Based on the quantitative assessment, the Company determined that the fair value of its reporting unit was less than its carrying value and recognized a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of million in the fiscal quarter ending March 31,2020, equal to the excess of the Bad Daddy s reporting unit s carrying value above its fair value. No goodwill impairment charges were recognized related to goodwill attributable to its Good Times reporting unit in fiscal 2020 and no goodwill impairment charges were recognized for either reporting unit in fiscal 2021. related to the impairment of these restaurants during the fiscal year ended September 29, 2020. . Under the CARES Act, of the total deferred employment tax was to be repaid on December 31, 2021, with the remaining amount due on December 31, 2022. As such, the Company recorded the entirety of the deferred employment tax as a long-term liability as of September 29, 2020. All deferred employment taxes were subsequently repaid during the fiscal year ended September 28, 2021. ; therefore, no income tax provision or benefit was recognized for the fiscal years ended September 28, 2021 and September 29, 2020 resulting in an effective income tax rate of for both periods. 
 The Company is subject to taxation in various jurisdictions within the U.S. The Company continues to remain subject to examination by U.S. federal authorities for the years 2018 through 2021. The Company believes that its income tax filing positions and deductions will be sustained on audit and does not anticipate any adjustments that will result in a material adverse effect on the Company s financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. Therefore, no reserves for uncertain income tax positions have been recorded. The Company s practice is to recognize interest and/or penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense. No accrual for interest and penalties was considered necessary as of September 28, 2021.

All are due in the normal course of business. The Company believes it will collect fully on all receivables.

 As previously disclosed in the Company s Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 29, 2020, the Company is the defendant in a lawsuit styled as White Winston Select Asset Funds, LLC and GT Acquisition Group, Inc. v. Good Times Restaurants, Inc., arising from the failed negotiations between plaintiffs and the Company for the sale of the Good Times Drive Thru subsidiary to plaintiffs. The lawsuit was initially filed on September 24, 2019 in Delaware Chancery Court, and Company removed the case to federal court in the US District Court for the District of Delaware on November 5, 2019. On July 30, 2021, the plaintiffs moved the Court for leave to amend their complaint and add new causes of action and a claim for million in damages. On August 31, 2021, the Company s retained damages expert submitted a report in response to the plaintiffs claims for damages. Good Times contends that the most reasonable estimation of damages is between and million. The estimate assumes a finding of liability in favor of the plaintiffs and their ability to satisfy the legal standards for proving damages. The Company views these events as not probable. On October 25, 2021, the Court granted the plaintiffs leave to amend their complaint and add new causes of action and damages. The Company will continue to vigorously pursue a full defense of this matter on the merits. Because the Company has concluded that a loss is not probable, we therefore have not recorded a liability related to the litigation. The Company will continue to evaluate this matter based on new information as it becomes available. 
 There may be various claims in process, matters in litigation, and other contingencies brought against the company by employees, vendors, customers, franchisees, or other parties. Evaluating these contingencies is a complex process that may involve substantial judgment on the potential outcome of such matters, and the ultimate outcome of such contingencies may differ from our current analysis. We regularly review the adequacy of accruals and disclosures related to such contingent liabilities in consultation with legal counsel. While it is not possible to predict the outcome of these claims with certainty, it is management s opinion that any reasonably possible losses associated with such contingencies would be immaterial to our financial statements.

 The Company determines if a contract contains a lease at inception. The Company s material long-term operating lease agreements are for the land and buildings for our restaurants as well as our corporate office. The initial lease terms for our restaurants range from years to years, most of which at lease inception included renewal options of to years. The lease term is generally the minimum of the noncancelable period or the lease term including renewal options which are reasonably certain of being exercised up to a term of approximately years. 
 Some of the leases provide for base rent, plus additional rent based on gross sales, as defined in each lease agreement. The Company is also generally obligated to pay certain real estate taxes, insurance and common area maintenance charges, and various other expenses related to properties, which are expensed as incurred.

The Company has net operating loss carry-forwards available for future periods, as discussed below, of approximately from 2019, from 2018, and from 2011 and prior for income tax purposes. The net operating loss carry-forwards from periods prior to 2019 expire between and . Based on the change in control, which occurred in 2011, the utilization of the loss carry-forwards incurred for periods prior to 2012 is limited to approximately per year. The Company has general business tax credits of from 2015 through 2021 which expire from through . 
 The Company continually reviews the realizability of its deferred tax assets, including an analysis of factors such as future taxable income, reversal of existing taxable temporary differences, and tax planning strategies. The Company assessed whether a valuation allowance should be recorded against its deferred tax assets based on consideration of all available evidence using a more likely than not standard. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, the company considered both positive and negative evidence related to the likelihood of realization of deferred tax assets. In making such assessment, more weight was given to evidence that could be objectively verified, including recent cumulative losses. Future sources of taxable income were also considered in determining the amount of the recorded valuation allowance. Based on the Company s review of this evidence, management determined that a full valuation allowance against all of the Company s deferred tax assets was appropriate.

Exhibit 4.3 

General 

Our
authorized capital stock consists of 50,000,000 shares of common stock, 0.001 par value per share, and 5,000,000 shares of preferred
stock, 0.01 par value per share. 

Common Stock 

The
holders of our common stock are entitled to one vote per share on all matters submitted to a vote of shareholders and our articles of
incorporation do not provide for cumulative voting in the election of directors unless required by applicable law. Subject
to preferences that may be applicable to any outstanding series of preferred stock, the holders of our common stock will receive ratably
any dividends declared by our Board of Directors out of funds legally available for the payment of dividends. In the event
of our liquidation, dissolution or winding-up, the holders of our common stock are entitled to share ratably in all assets remaining after
payment of or provision for any liabilities, subject to prior distribution rights of preferred stock, if any, then outstanding. 

Preferred Stock 

Our
articles of incorporation provide that our Board of Directors has the authority, without further action by the shareholders, to issue
up to 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock. Our Board of Directors will be able to issue preferred stock in one or more series
and determine the voting powers, preferences and relative, participating, optional and other special rights of the shares of any such
series of preferred stock, and the qualifications, limitations, and restrictions of such shares, any or all of which may be greater than
the rights of our common stock. Issuances of preferred stock could adversely affect the voting power of common stock and reduce
the likelihood that holders of our common stock will receive dividend payments and payments upon liquidation. Any issuance
of preferred stock also could have the effect of decreasing the market price for our common stock and could delay, deter or prevent a
change in control of the Company. 

Our
Board of Directors previously designated 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock as Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, 1,240,000
shares of preferred stock as Series B Convertible Preferred Stock, and 473,934 shares of preferred stock as Series
C Convertible Preferred Stock. No shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, Series B Convertible Preferred Stock
or Series C Convertible Preferred Stock are currently outstanding. 

Provisions of
Our Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws and Nevada Law that May Have an Anti-Takeover Effect 

We
are subject to anti-takeover laws for Nevada corporations. These anti-takeover laws prevent a Nevada corporation from engaging
in a business combination with any stockholder, including all affiliates and associates of the shareholder, who is the beneficial owner
of 10 or more of the corporation s outstanding voting stock, for two years following the date that the shareholder first became
the beneficial owner of 10 or more of the corporation s voting stock, unless specified conditions are met. If those
conditions are not met, then after the expiration of the two-year period the corporation may not engage in a business combination with
such shareholder unless certain other conditions are met. 

Our
articles of incorporation and our bylaws contain a number of provisions that may deter or impede takeovers or changes of control or management. These
provisions: 

authorize our Board of Directors to establish one or more series of preferred stock the terms of which can be determined by the Board of Directors at the time of issuance; 

do not allow for cumulative voting in the election of directors unless required by applicable law. Under cumulative voting a minority shareholder holding a sufficient percentage of a class of shares may be able to ensure the election of one or more directors; 

state that special meetings of our shareholders may be called only by the Chairman of the Board, the president or any two directors and must be called by the president upon the written request of the holders of 10 percent of the outstanding shares of capital stock entitled to vote at such special meeting; and 

provide that the authorized number of directors is no more than five, as determined by our Board of Directors. 

These
provisions, alone or in combination with each other, may discourage transactions involving actual or potential changes of control, including
transactions that otherwise could involve payment of a premium over prevailing market prices to shareholders for their common stock. 

Limitations on Liability
and Indemnification of Officers and Directors 

Nevada
law authorizes corporations to limit or eliminate (with a few exceptions) the personal liability of directors to corporations and their
shareholders for monetary damages for breaches of directors fiduciary duties as directors. Our articles of incorporation
and bylaws include provisions that eliminate, to the extent allowable under Nevada law, the personal liability of directors or officers
for monetary damages for actions taken as a director or officer, as the case may be. Our articles of incorporation and bylaws
also provide that we must indemnify and advance reasonable expenses to our directors and officers to the fullest extent permitted by Nevada
law. We are also expressly authorized to carry directors and officers insurance for our directors, officers,
employees and agents for some liabilities. 

The
limitation of liability and indemnification provisions in our articles of incorporation and bylaws may discourage shareholders from bringing
a lawsuit against directors for breach of their fiduciary duty. These provisions may also have the effect of reducing the likelihood
of derivative litigation against directors and officers, even though such an action, if successful, might otherwise benefit us and our
shareholders. In addition, your investment may be adversely affected to the extent that, in a class action or direct suit,
we pay the costs of settlement and damage awards against directors and officers pursuant to the indemnification provisions in our articles
of incorporation and bylaws. 

There
is currently no pending litigation or proceeding involving any of our directors, officers or employees for which indemnification is sought. 

Authorized but Unissued
Shares 

Our
authorized but unissued shares of common stock and preferred stock are available for future issuance without shareholder approval. Nevada
law does not require shareholder approval for any issuance of authorized shares. However, the NASDAQ listing requirements require
shareholder approval of certain issuances equal to or exceeding 20 of the then-outstanding voting power or the then-outstanding number
of shares of common stock. No assurances can be given that our shares will remain so listed. We may use additional
shares for a variety of corporate purposes, including future public offerings to raise additional capital, corporate acquisitions, and
employee benefit plans. The existence of authorized but unissued shares of common stock and preferred stock could render more
difficult or discourage an attempt to obtain control of us by means of a proxy contest, tender offer, merger or otherwise.

Our common stock is listed
on The Nasdaq Capital Market under the trading symbol GTIM .
