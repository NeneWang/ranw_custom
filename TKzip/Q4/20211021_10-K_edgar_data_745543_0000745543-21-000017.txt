 ITEM 1. BUSINESS. 
 
 CORPORATE HISTORY 
 
 All State Properties L.P., a limited partnership (the Partnership was organized under the Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act of Delaware on April 27, 1984 to conduct the business formerly carried on by its predecessor corporation, All State Properties, Inc. (the Corporation and together with the Partnership, the Company . In March 2007 Hubei Longdan (Delaware), Inc. Longdan Delaware and Subsidiary was organized under the laws of the State of Delaware as a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. Longdan Delaware had only nominal assets and no liabilities and had conducted no activities except in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Acquisition Agreement. The Company together with Longdan Delaware referred to herein as the Registrant . Pursuant to a Plan of Liquidation adopted by shareholders of the Corporation on September 30, 1984, the Corporation transferred substantially all of its assets to the Partnership, and the Corporation distributed such limited partnership interests to its shareholders. The Registrant was engaged since inception in land development and the construction and sale of residential housing in various parts of the eastern United States and in Argentina with its most recent transactions being in Florida. 
 
 Since August 1999, the Company s only business has been the ownership of a member interest of approximately 35 in Tunicom LLC, a Florida limited liability company Tunicom ). An affiliate of Tunicom was engaged in the ownership and operation of an adult rental apartment complex until the sale of the apartment complex in August 2000. Since that time, Tunicom s only business was activities relating to its attempts to sell its only remaining asset, five acres of commercial and residential land in Broward County, Florida (the Remaining Property ).

 Upon the effectiveness and as a result of the Merger, the Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws of ASPH became the Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws of the Surviving Corporation. 
 
 In addition, each share of common stock of ASP that was issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Merger was converted into 1 issued and outstanding share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation Common Stock ), so that the holders of all of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of ASP immediately prior to the Merger are the holders of Common Stock of the Surviving Corporation.

 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
 
 To the Shareholders and 
 Board of Directors of Petro USA, Inc. (formerly All State Properties Holdings, Inc.) 
 
 Opinion on the Financial Statements 
 
 We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Petro USA, Inc. (formerly All State Properties Holdings, Inc.) (the Company as of June 30, 2021 and 2020, the related statements of operations, changes in stockholders deficit, and cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended June 30, 2021, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements ). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of June 30, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended June 30, 2021, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
 
 Substantial Doubt About the Company s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern 
 
 The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, the Company s continuing operating losses raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern for a period of one year from the issuance of these financial statements. Management s plans are also described in Note 2. The financial statements do not include adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 
 
 Basis of Opinion 
 
 These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 
 We conducted our audit in accordance with standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audit, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 
 
 Our audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 
 Critical Audit Matters 
 
 Critical audit matters are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. We determined that there are no critical audit matters.

 Notes to Financial Statements 
 For the years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020 

1. Organization, Description of Business, and Basis of Accounting 
 Business Organization 
 
 Petro USA, Inc, formerly All State Properties Holdings, Inc., a corporation (the Company was organized under the state of Nevada on April 24, 2008 to conduct business formerly carried on by its predecessor partnership, All State Properties L.P. (the Partnership ). The Partnership merged with the Company on May 29, 2008. The Company acquired all of the assets and assumed all of the liabilities and obligations of the Partnership. At May 29, 2008 each unit, par value 0.001 per share of the Partnership was converted into one issued and outstanding share of par value 0.0001 common stock of the Corporation. 
 
 On November 10, 2020, the majority of the shareholders and board of directors of the Registrant approved a name change for the Registrant to Petro U.S.A., Inc. to reflect a change in the business to become an operator of truck stops and travel centers in the United States, offering diesel fuel and gasoline, full service and fast food restaurants, maintenance and repair service for trucks , and groceries and convenience goods, among other products and services. 
 
 The Company s fiscal year end is June 30th. 
 Accounting Basis 
 
 These financial statements have been prepared on the accrual basis of accounting following generally accepted accounting principles of the United States of America consistently applied. 
 
 Use of Estimates 
 
 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
 
 Income Taxes 
 
 The Company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. At June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively, the deferred tax asset and deferred tax liability accounts, as recorded when material to the financial statements, are entirely the result of temporary differences. Temporary differences represent differences in the recognition of assets and liabilities for tax and financial reporting purposes, primarily share based compensation and loss on settlement of debt. 
 
 As of June 30, 2021, the deferred tax asset related to the Company's net operating loss (NOL) carry forward is fully reserved. Due to the provisions of Internal Revenue Code Section 338, the Company may have no net operating loss carry forwards available to offset financial statement or tax return taxable income in future periods as a result of a change in control involving 50 percentage points or more of the issued and outstanding securities of the Company.

1. Organization, Description of Business, and Basis of Accounting (Continued) 
 
 Dividends 
 
 The Company has not yet adopted a policy regarding the payment of dividends. 
 
 Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
 
 The carrying value of cash, accounts payable and amounts due to related party approximates its fair value because of the short maturity of these instruments. Unless otherwise noted, it is management s opinion the Company is not exposed to significant interest, currency or credit risks arising from these financial instruments. 
 
 The Company accounts for financial instruments in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standard Board's Accounting Standards Codification Topic 820 Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures ASC 820 ), which establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure of fair value measurements. Fair value is an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. As a basis for considering such assumptions, this policy established a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows: 
 Level 1. Observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; 
 Level 2. Inputs, other than the quoted prices in active markets, that are observable either directly or indirectly; and 
 Level 3. Unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data, which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions. 
 
 The following table presents assets that are measured and recognized at fair value on a non-recurring basis: 
 
 Level 1: None 
 Level 2: None 
 Level 3: None 
 
 The Fair Value Option permits entities to choose to measure eligible financial instruments and certain other items at fair value at specified election dates. A business entity shall report unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value options have been elected in earnings at each subsequent reporting date. For the years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, there were no applicable items on which the fair value option was elected. The Fair Value Option may impact our consolidated financial statements in the future. 
 
 Earnings (Loss) per Share 
 
 Basic earnings (loss) per share is computed by dividing the net income (loss) available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the respective period presented in our accompanying financial statements.

 Notes to Financial Statements

1. Organization, Description of Business, and Basis of Accounting (Continued) 

Fully diluted earnings (loss) per share is computed similar to basic income (loss) per share except that the denominator is increased to include the number of common stock equivalents (primarily outstanding options and warrants). 
 Common stock equivalents represent the dilutive effect of the assumed exercise of outstanding stock options and warrants, using the treasury stock method, at either the beginning of the respective period presented or the date of issuance, whichever is later, and only if the common stock equivalents are considered dilutive based upon the Company s net income (loss) position at the calculation date. 
 
 As of June 30, 2021 and 2020, the Company s has no issued and outstanding warrants or options. 

2. Going Concern 
 
 The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and the liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. However, the Company has incurred significant losses and is dependent on obtaining adequate capital to fund operating losses until it becomes profitable. If the Company is unable to obtain the necessary funding it could cease operations as a new enterprise. This raises substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern for a period of one year from the issuance of these financial statements. These financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from this uncertainty 

3. Income Taxes 
 The Company provides for income taxes asset and liability approach in accounting for income taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded based on the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities and the tax rates in effect when these differences are expected to reverse. This method requires the reduction of deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. 
 The provision for income taxes differs from the amounts which would be provided by applying the statutory federal income tax rate of 21 to the net loss before provision for income taxes for the following reasons:

No provision was made for federal income taxes as the Company has significant net operating losses.

 Due to the provisions of Internal Revenue Code Section 338, the Company may have no net operating loss carry forwards available to offset financial statement or tax return taxable income in future periods as a result of a change in control involving 50 percentage points or more of the issued and outstanding securities of the Company. The Company had no uncertain tax positions at June 30, 2021 or 2020.

 ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE. 
 
 BOYLE CPA, LLC 
 
 This decision to engage Boyle CPA, LLC was approved by our full Board of Directors. Because we have no standing audit committee, our full Board of Directors participated in and approved the decision to change independent accountants. Presently, the Board of Directors acts as the audit committee. 
 
 ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. 
 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 We have carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer/Principal Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )) as of June 30, 2020. Based on such evaluation, we have concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in applicable SEC rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer/Principal Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely discussions regarding required disclosure. 
 
 Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining internal control over financial reporting for our internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Internal control over our financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: 
 
 (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairy reflect our transactions. 
 
 (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorization of our management and directors; and 
 
 (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements. 
 
 All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error or circumvention through collusion of improper overriding of controls. Therefore, even those internal control systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation. Further, because of changes in conditions, the effectiveness of internal control may vary over time. 
 
 Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2019. In making its assessment of internal control over financial reporting, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO 2013 in Internal-Control-Integrated Framework and implemented a process to monitor and assess both the design and operating effectiveness of our internal controls. Based on this assessment, management believes that as of June 30, 2021, our internal control over financial reporting was not effective. 
 
 We have instituted a remediation plan which involves reeducating our management, the accounting staff, and the administrative staff as to the elements of a completed sale. We increased the oversight of the process by increasing the frequency of involvement of outside accounting consultants. Internal systems are being put into place to track and document significant dates, such as delivery, installation and customer acceptance. In addition, the bookkeeping system has been modified so that all sales of extended warranties are automatically recorded as deferred revenue and that the amount of revenue that is ultimately recognized as warranty revenue is as the result of an analysis of the significant aspects of the warranty such as coverage and period. 
 22 
 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
 Our management has evaluated, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer/Chief Financial Officer, changes in our internal controls over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) during the fourth quarter of 2020. In connection with such evaluation, there have been no changes to our internal control over financial reporting that occurred since the beginning of our fourth quarter of 2020 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting. While there have been no changes, we have assessed our internal controls as being deficient and will be taking steps beginning in 2021 to remedy such deficiencies.

Officers, directors and greater than ten percent beneficial owners are required by Commission regulations to furnish us with copies of all forms they file pursuant to Section 16(a). Based solely on our review of the copies of such forms received and written representations from reporting persons required to file reports under Section 16(a), all of the Section 16(a) filing requirements applicable to such persons, with respect to fiscal year 2016, appear not to have been complied with to the best of our knowledge.

 Our Articles of Incorporation, as amended and restated, and our Bylaws provide for mandatory indemnification of our officers and directors, except where such person has been adjudicated liable by reason of his negligence or willful misconduct toward the Company or such other corporation in the performance of his duties as such officer or director. Our Bylaws also authorize the purchase of director and officer liability insurance to insure them against any liability asserted against or incurred by such person in that capacity or arising from such person's status as a director, officer, employee, fiduciary, or agent, whether or not the corporation would have the power to indemnify such person under the applicable law.

 ITEM 13. CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS, AND DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE. 
 
 We do not have a specific policy or procedure for the review, approval, or ratification of any transaction involving related persons. We historically have sought and obtained funding from officers, directors, and family members as these categories of persons are familiar with our management and often provide better terms and conditions than we can obtain from unassociated sources. Also, we are so small that having specific policies or procedures of this type would be unworkable.
