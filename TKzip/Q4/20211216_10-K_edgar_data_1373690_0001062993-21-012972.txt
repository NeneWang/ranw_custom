 PART I 
 Item 1. Business 
 Corporate Overview 
 Our principal executive offices are located at 41 Puget Drive, Steilacoom, WA. Our telephone number is (250) 681-1010. 
 Our common stock is quoted on the OTC Pink under the symbol "IRCC". 
 Corporate History 
 We were incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on July 20, 2006 under the name "Zebra Resources Incorporated" (aka "Zebra Resources Inc."). At inception, we were an exploration stage company engaged in the acquisition, exploration and development of mineral properties. 
 Effective March 17, 2010, we effected a one (1) old for two (2) new forward stock split of our issued and outstanding common stock. As a result, our authorized capital increased from 75,000,000 to 150,000,000 shares of common stock and our issued and outstanding increased from 32,000,000 shares of common stock to 64,000,000 shares of common stock, all with a par value of 0.001. 
 5 
 
 Effective March 17, 2010, we changed our name from "Zebra Resources Incorporated" to "American Paramount Gold Corp.", by way of a merger with our wholly owned subsidiary American Paramount Gold Corp., which was formed solely for the change of name. 
 The name change and forward stock split became effective with the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board at the opening for trading on April 12, 2010 under the new stock symbol "APGA". 
 On July 30, 2010, our directors approved the adoption of the 2010 Stock Option Plan ("2010 Plan") which permits our company to issue up to 6,500,000 shares of our common stock to directors, officers, employees and consultants of our company upon the exercise of stock options granted under the 2010 Plan. As at August 31, 2016, there are no outstanding stock options. 
 On November 16, 2011, our company's board of directors approved a forty (40) for one (1) reverse stock split of our authorized and issued and outstanding common shares. 
 On November 28, 2011, the Nevada Secretary of State accepted for filing a Certificate of Change, wherein we effected an amendment to our Articles of Incorporation to decrease the authorized number of shares of our common stock from 150,000,000 to 3,750,000 shares of common stock, par value of 0.001. On November 29, 2011 the Nevada Secretary of State accepted for filing a Certificate of Correction, wherein we effected an amendment to our Articles of Incorporation to correct the Certificate of Change filed on November 28, 2011 to state that no fractional shares shall be issued and that fractional shares shall be rounded up rather than rounded down. 
 The reverse split became effective with the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board at the opening of trading on January 26, 2012 under the new symbol APGA. The CUSIP number was changed to 02882T 204. 
 Effective January 8, 2019, we changed our name to Indigenous Roots Corp. 
 The name change became effective with the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board at the opening for trading on February 9, 2019 under the stock symbol "IRCC". Our CUSIP number is 455685107.

 Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 Risks Related to Our Company 
 The fact that we have not earned any operating revenues since our incorporation raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. 
 We have generated minimal revenue from operations since our incorporation. Due to its inability to meet its debt obligation, the Company may have to forfeit ownership of the Solar Power System and thus lose its only revenue producing asset. We had cash of 515,903 as of August 31, 2021 23,114-August 31, 2020) and a working capital deficiency of 1,080,003. We have a cumulative net loss of 4,902,173 from our inception on July 20, 2006 through August 31, 2021. We estimate that our average annual operating expenses will be approximately 200,000 including management services and administrative costs. We have traditionally raised our operating capital from sales of equity securities, but there can be no assurance that we will continue to be able to do so. 
 8 
 
 Management plans to seek additional capital through a private placement of its capital stock. These conditions raise substantial doubt about our company's ability to continue as a going concern. Although there are no assurances that management's plans will be realized, management believes that our company will be able to continue operations in the future. The financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded assets, or the amounts of and classification of liabilities that might be necessary in the event our company cannot continue in existence. We continue to experience net operating losses. 
 Risks Associated with Our Common Stock 
 Trading on the OTC Bulletin Board may be volatile and sporadic, which could depress the market price of our common stock and make it difficult for our stockholders to resell their shares. 
 Our common stock is quoted on the OTC Pinksheet service of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. Trading in stock quoted on the OTC Pinksheet is often thin and characterized by wide fluctuations in trading prices, due to many factors that may have little to do with our operations or business prospects. This volatility could depress the market price of our common stock for reasons unrelated to operating performance. Moreover, the OTC Bulletin Board is not a stock exchange, and trading of securities on the OTC Bulletin Board is often more sporadic than the trading of securities listed on a quotation system like NASDAQ or a stock exchange like NYSE Amex. Accordingly, shareholders may have difficulty reselling any of their shares. 
 Our stock is a penny stock. Trading of our stock may be restricted by the SEC's penny stock regulations and FINRA's sales practice requirements, which may limit a stockholder's ability to buy and sell our stock. 
 Our stock is a penny stock. The Securities and Exchange Commission has adopted Rule 15g-9 which generally defines "penny stock" to be any equity security that has a market price (as defined) less than 5.00 per share or an exercise price of less than 5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions. Our securities are covered by the penny stock rules, which impose additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers who sell to persons other than established customers and "accredited investors". The term "accredited investor" refers generally to institutions with assets in excess of 5,000,000 or individuals with a net worth in excess of 1,000,000 or annual income exceeding 200,000 or 300,000 jointly with their spouse. The penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from the rules, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document in a form prepared by the SEC which provides information about penny stocks and the nature and level of risks in the penny stock market. The broker-dealer also must provide the customer with current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock, the compensation of the broker-dealer and its salesperson in the transaction and monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer's account. The bid and offer quotations, and the broker-dealer and salesperson compensation information, must be given to the customer orally or in writing prior to effecting the transaction and must be given to the customer in writing before or with the customer's confirmation. In addition, the penny stock rules require that prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from these rules; the broker-dealer must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser's written agreement to the transaction. These disclosure requirements may have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity in the secondary market for the stock that is subject to these penny stock rules. Consequently, these penny stock rules may affect the ability of broker-dealers to trade our securities. We believe that the penny stock rules discourage investor interest in, and limit the marketability of, our common stock. 
 9 
 
 In addition to the "penny stock" rules promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority has adopted rules that require that in recommending an investment to a customer, a broker-dealer must have reasonable grounds for believing that the investment is suitable for that customer. Prior to recommending speculative low-priced securities to their non-institutional customers, broker-dealers must make reasonable efforts to obtain information about the customer's financial status, tax status, investment objectives and other information. Under interpretations of these rules, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority believes that there is a high probability that speculative low-priced securities will not be suitable for at least some customers. The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority requirements make it more difficult for broker-dealers to recommend that their customers buy our common stock, which may limit your ability to buy and sell our stock. 
 Other Risks 
 Trends, Risks and Uncertainties 
 We have sought to identify what we believe to be the most significant risks to our business, but we cannot predict whether, or to what extent, any of such risks may be realized nor can we guarantee that we have identified all possible risks that might arise. Investors should carefully consider all such risk factors before making an investment decision with respect to our common stock.

 Item 6. Selected Financial Data 
 As a "smaller reporting company", we are not required to provide the information required by this Item. 
 Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our audited financial statements and the related notes for the years ended August 31, 2021 and August 31, 2020 that appear elsewhere in this annual report. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward- looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to those discussed below and elsewhere in this annual report, particularly in the section entitled "Risk Factors" beginning on page 7 of this annual report. 
 12 
 
 Our audited financial statements are stated in United States Dollars and are prepared in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. 
 Cash Requirements 
 Over the next 12 months we intend to operate as a business development company. We anticipate that we will incur the following operating expenses during this period:

Total 
 
 200,000 

At present, our cash requirements for the next 12 months outweigh the funds available. Of the 200,000 that we require for the next 12 months, we have 515,903 in cash and a working capital deficiency of 1,080,003 In order to improve our liquidity, we plan to pursue additional equity financing from private investors or possibly a registered public offering. We do not currently have any definitive arrangements in place for the completion of any further private placement financings and there is no assurance that we will be successful in completing any further private placement financings. If we are unable to achieve the necessary additional financing, then we plan to reduce the amounts that we spend on our business activities and administrative expenses in order to be within the amount of capital resources that are available to us. 
 Purchase of Significant Equipment 
 We do not anticipate the purchase or sale of any plant or significant equipment during the next 12 months. 
 Going Concern 
 The financial statements included in this filing have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles that contemplate the continuance of our company as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has generated minimal revenue from operations. As shown on the accompanying financial statements, our company has incurred a net loss of 4,902,173 for the period from inception (July 20, 2006) to August 31, 2021 and has a working capital deficiency of 1,080,003 as at August 31, 2021. These conditions raise substantial doubt about our company's ability to continue as a going concern. 
 The future of our company is dependent upon its ability to obtain financing and upon future profitable operations from the development of its mining activities. 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements or capital resources that is material to stockholders. 
 There were none during the years ended August 31, 2021 or 2020.

 Critical Accounting Policies 
 Our financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America for financial statements. Preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. These estimates and assumptions are affected by management's application of accounting policies. We believe that understanding the basis and nature of the estimates and assumptions involved with the following aspects of our financial statements is critical to an understanding of our financials. 
 Accounting estimates 
 The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
 Cash and cash equivalents 
 For purposes of the statement of cash flows, our company considers highly liquid financial instruments purchased with a maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. 
 Fair value of financial instruments 
 The Company measures the fair value of financial assets and liabilities based on GAAP guidance which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. Under GAAP, fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. A fair value hierarchy is also established, which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. 
 Level 1 - Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. 
 Level 2 - Quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or inputs that are observable. 
 Level 3 - Inputs that are unobservable (for example cash flow modelling inputs based on assumptions). 
 The table below presents the carrying value and fair value of our company's financial instruments. 
 The fair value represents management's best estimates based on a range of methodologies and assumptions. The carrying value of receivables and payables arising in the ordinary course of business and the receivable from taxing authorities, approximate fair value because of the relatively short period of time between their origination and expected realization.

 Income taxes 
 The Company follows the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes, which requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis and tax credit carry-forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in operations in the period that includes the enactment date. The Company has a net operating loss carry-forward to be used in future years. The Company has established a valuation allowance for the full tax benefit of the operating loss carry-forwards due to the uncertainty regarding realization. 
 Net loss per common share 
 Basic net loss per share is computed by dividing the net loss available to common stockholders for the period by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. The calculation of diluted net loss per share gives effect to common stock equivalents; however, potential common shares are excluded if their effect is anti-dilutive. 
 Stock-based compensation 
 The Company applies the fair value method for accounting for stock option awards, whereby the Company recognizes a compensation expense for all stock options awarded to employees, officers and consultants based on the fair value of the options on the date of grant, which is determined using the Black-Scholes Option Pricing Model. The options are expensed over the vesting period of the options on a graded vesting basis. 
 The Company accounts for equity instruments issued in exchange for the receipt of goods or services from other than at the estimated fair market value of the consideration received or the estimated fair value of the equity instruments issued, whichever is more reliably measurable. The value of equity instruments issued for consideration for other than employee services is determined on the earliest of a performance commitment or completion of performance by the provider of goods or services.

 Concentration of credit risk 
 Our company places our cash and cash equivalents with high credit quality financial institutions. 
 Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
 Recent accounting pronouncements issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board or other authoritative standards groups with future effective dates are either not applicable or are not expected to be significant to the financial statements of the Company.

 Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Indigenous Roots Corp. (the "Company") as of August 31, 2020 and 2019, the related consolidated statements of operations, cash flows and changes in deficit for the years then ended, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the "financial statements"). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of August 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
 Going Concern The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, the Company has incurred losses in developing its business, and further losses are anticipated. The Company requires additional funds to meet its obligations and the costs of its operations. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. Management s plans in this regard are described in Note 1. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty 
 Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audit.

Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. As part of our audit we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. 
 Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks.

 INDIGENOUS ROOTS CORP. 
 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AUGUST 31, 2021 (Stated in U.S. Dollars) 
 1. ORGANIZATION AND NATURE OF BUSINESS 
 Indigenous Roots Corp. (the "Company") was incorporated in the State of Nevada on July 20, 2006 and is listed on the OTCQB under the symbol "IRCC". 
 On April 1, 2019, the Company acquired 100 of the issued and outstanding shares of Edison Power Company ('Edison Power"), a Nevada corporation, in exchange for 6,849,239 common shares of the Company. Edison Power owns a 100 interest in Edison Delaware 2 LLC, a Delaware registered limited liability corporation that owns and operates a 140 kW/h solar power generating facility in Georgetown, Delaware. The facility was substantially completed in March, 2019 and began generating power in April, 2019 (Note 3). 
 On December 1, 2019, the Company acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of Edison Power Corporation ("EPC") in exchange for cash of 10. EPC was federally incorporated in Canada on April 13, 2015. EPC has no equity and has not generated any revenue since inception. 
 Going concern 
 The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern. At August 31, 2021 the Company had an accumulated deficit of 5,631,953 and a working capital deficiency of 1,080,003. Continuation as a going concern is dependent upon the ability of the Company to obtain the necessary financing to meet obligations and pay its liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due and ultimately upon its ability to achieve profitable operations. Due to its inability to meet its debt obligation, the Company may have to forfeit ownership of the Solar Power System and thus lose its only revenue producing asset. The outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with any certainty at this time and raise substantial doubt that the Company will be able to continue as a going concern. These financial statements do not include any adjustments to the amounts and classification of assets and liabilities that may be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. Management intends to obtain additional funding by borrowing funds from its directors and officers, issuing promissory notes and/or a private placement of common stock. 
 In March 2020 the World Health Organization declared coronavirus COVID-19 a global pandemic. This contagious disease outbreak, which has continued to spread, and any related adverse public health developments, has adversely affected workforces, economies, and financial markets globally, potentially leading to an economic downturn. There has been no immediate impact on the Company and the future impact is currently not determinable but management continues to monitor the situation. 
 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
 (a) Basis of Presentation 
 These financial statements and related notes are presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and are expressed in U.S. dollars. 
 (b) Principles of Consolidation 
 These financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries. Subsidiaries are all entities (including structured entities) which the Company controls. For accounting purposes, control is established by an investor when it is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. All inter-company balances and transactions are eliminated upon consolidation. 
 (c) Use of Estimates 
 The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses in the reporting period. The Company regularly evaluates estimates and assumptions related to useful life of fixed asset and deferred income tax asset valuation allowances. 
 The Company bases its estimates and assumptions on current facts, historical experience and various other factors that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the accrual of costs and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. The actual results experienced by the Company may differ materially and adversely from the Company's estimates. To the extent there are material differences between the estimates and the actual results, future results of operations will be affected. 
 24 
 
 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued) 
 (d) Cash and Cash Equivalents 
 The Company considers all highly liquid instruments with maturity of three months or less at the time of issuance and trust funds to be cash equivalents. 
 (e) Impairment of Long-Lived Assets 
 The Company evaluates the recoverability of its fixed assets and other assets in accordance with ASC 360-10-15, Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets . Impairment of long-lived assets is recognized when the net book value of such assets exceeds their expected cash flows, in which case the assets are written down to fair value, which is determined based on discounted future cash flows or appraised values. 
 (f) Related Party Transactions 
 The Company follows ASC 850, Related Party Disclosures , for the identification of related parties and disclosure of related party transactions. In accordance with ASC 850, the Company's financial statements include disclosures of material related party transactions, other than compensation arrangements, expense allowances, and other similar items in the ordinary course of business, as well as transactions that are eliminated in the preparation of financial statements. 
 (g) Income Taxes 
 The Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method in accordance with ASC 740, "Income Taxes". The asset and liability method provide that deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized. 
 (h) Foreign Currency Translation 
 The Company and its subsidiaries' functional and reporting currency is the U.S. dollar. Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into the currency of measurement at the exchange rates in effect on the transaction date. Monetary balance sheet items expressed in foreign currencies are translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date. The resulting exchange gains and losses are recognized in the statement of operations. 
 (i) Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measures 
 ASC 820, "Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures", requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. ASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy based on the level of independent, objective evidence surrounding the inputs used to measure fair value. A financial instrument's categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. ASC 820 prioritizes the inputs into three levels that may be used to measure fair value: 
 Level 1 - Level 1 applies to assets or liabilities for which there are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. 
 Level 2 - Level 2 applies to assets or liabilities for which there are inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets with insufficient volume or infrequent transactions (less active markets); or model-derived valuations in which significant inputs are observable or can be derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data. 
 25 
 
 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued) 
 (i) Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measures (continued) 
 Level 3 - applies to assets or liabilities for which there are unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of the fair value of the assets or liabilities. 
 The Company's financial instruments consist principally of cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable, loan payable, and amounts due to related parties. Pursuant to ASC 820, the fair value of cash is determined based on "Level 1" inputs, which consist of quoted prices in active markets for identical assets. The recorded values of all other financial instruments approximate their current fair values because of their nature and respective maturity dates or durations. 
 (j) Stock-based Compensation 
 The Company records stock-based compensation in accordance with ASC 718, "Compensation - Stock Compensation" and ASC 505, "Equity Based Payments to Non-Employees", using the fair value method. All transactions in which goods or services are the consideration received for the issuance of equity instruments are accounted for based on the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instrument issued, whichever is more reliably measurable. 
 (k) Revenue 
 Pursuant to ASC 606, Revenue is derived from the generation of electricity utilizing the solar power generating system and collectivity is reasonably assured. 
 (l) Leases 
 Pursuant to ASC 842, transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing transactions. As of the date of this report, the Company has no material leases to report. 
 (m) Loss Per Share 
 The Company computes earnings (loss) per share in accordance with ASC 260, "Earnings per Share". ASC 260 requires presentation of both basic and diluted earnings per share ("EPS") on the face of the income statement. Basic EPS is computed by dividing earnings (loss) available to common shareholders (numerator) by the weighted average number of shares outstanding (denominator) during the period. Diluted EPS gives effect to all dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method and convertible preferred stock using the if-converted method. In computing diluted EPS, the average stock price for the period is used in determining the number of shares assumed to be purchased from the exercise of stock options or warrants. Diluted EPS excludes all dilutive potential shares if their effect is anti-dilutive. As at August 31, 2021 the Company does not have any potentially dilutive shares. 
 (n) Comprehensive Loss 
 ASC 220, "Comprehensive Income", establishes standards for the reporting and display of comprehensive loss and its components in the financial statements. 
 (o) Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
 None.

 3. ACQUISITION 
 On April 1, 2019, the Company acquired 100 of the issued and outstanding shares of Edison Power, a Nevada corporation, in exchange for 6,849,239 common shares of the Company. Edison Power owns a 100 interest in Edison Delaware 2 LLC, a Delaware registered limited liability corporation that owns and operates a 140 kW/h solar power generating facility in Georgetown, Delaware. The facility was substantially completed in March, 2019 and began generating power in April, 2019. The transaction has been accounted for as an asset acquisition as Edison Power did not have inputs, processes and outputs in place that constituted a business under ASC 805 Business Combinations. The total consideration paid was allocated to the assets and liabilities acquired based on relative fair values:

 Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure 
 There were no disagreements related to accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, internal controls or auditing scope or procedure during the two fiscal years and interim periods. 
 Item 9A. Controls and Procedures 
 Management's Report on Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 , as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our president and chief financial officer (who are acting as our principal executive officer and as our principal financial officer and principle accounting officer) to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 As of August 31, 2021, the end of our fiscal year covered by this report, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our president (our principal executive officer) and our chief financial officer (our principal financial and accounting officer), of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based on the foregoing, our president (our principal executive officer) and our chief financial officer (our principal financial and accounting officer) concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of the end of the period covered by this annual report. 
 Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are required to assess the expected benefits and related costs of control procedures. The objectives of internal control include providing management with reasonable, but not absolute, assurance that assets are safeguarded against loss from unauthorized use or disposition, and that transactions are executed in accordance with management's authorization and recorded properly to permit the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of August 31, 2021. In making this assessment, our management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ("COSO") in Internal Control-Integrated Framework of 2013 . Our management has concluded that, as of August 31, 2021, our internal control over financial reporting is not effective. Our management reviewed the results of their assessment with our Board of Directors. 
 This annual report does not include an attestation report of our company's registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management's report was not subject to attestation by our Company's registered public accounting firm pursuant to temporary rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission that permit our Company to provide only management's report in this annual report. 
 Inherent limitations on effectiveness of controls 
 Internal control over financial reporting has inherent limitations which include but is not limited to the use of independent professionals for advice and guidance, interpretation of existing and/or changing rules and principles, segregation of management duties, scale of organization, and personnel factors. Internal control over financial reporting is a process which involves human diligence and compliance and is subject to lapses in judgment and breakdowns resulting from human failures. Internal control over financial reporting also can be circumvented by collusion or improper management override. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis, however these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process and it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce, though not eliminate, this risk. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
 30 
 
 Material Weaknesses Identified 
 In connection with the preparation of the financial statements for the year ended August 31, 2021, management identified the following material weakness in internal control: 
 Our company's accounting staff does not have sufficient technical accounting knowledge relating to accounting for income taxes and complex US GAAP matters. 
 Plan for Remediation of Material Weaknesses 
 We intend to take appropriate and reasonable steps to make the necessary improvements to remediate this deficiency as resources to do so become available. We intend to consider the results of our remediation efforts and related testing as part of our year-end 2021assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Such remediation would entail enhancing the training and oversight of the accounting personnel responsible for non-routine transactions involving complex accounting matters and engaging the services of an independent consultant with sufficient expertise in income tax and complex US GAAP matters to assist us in the preparation of our financial statements. 
 31 
 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There have been no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the fourth quarter ended August 31, 2021that have materially or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.

 On September 27, 2019, Lawrence Faulk was appointed President, CEO, Secretary, Treasurer and as Director. 
 On April 8, 2021, Ian Marshall was appointed as a Director of the Company. 
 Family Relationships 
 There are no family relationships between any of our directors, executive officers and proposed directors or executive officers. 
 Involvement in Certain Legal Proceedings 
 None. 
 32 
 
 Compliance with Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 
 Our common stock is not registered pursuant to Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"). Accordingly, our officers, directors, and principal stockholders are not subject to the beneficial ownership reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act. 
 Code of Ethics 
 Effective December 13, 2011, our company's board of directors adopted a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics that applies to, among other persons, members of our board of directors, our company's officers including our president (being our principal executive officer and principal financial officer), contractors, consultants and advisors. As adopted, our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics sets forth written standards that are designed to deter wrongdoing and to promote: 

1. 
 honest and ethical conduct, including the ethical handling of actual or apparent conflicts of interest between personal and professional relationships; 

2. 
 full, fair, accurate, timely, and understandable disclosure in reports and documents that we file with, or submit to, the Securities and Exchange Commission and in other public communications made by us; 

3. 
 compliance with applicable governmental laws, rules and regulations; 

4. 
 the prompt internal reporting of violations of the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics to an appropriate person or persons identified in the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics; and 

5. 
 accountability for adherence to the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics. 

Our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics requires, among other things, that all of our company's personnel shall be accorded full access to our president and secretary with respect to any matter which may arise relating to the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics. 
 Further, all of our company's personnel are to be accorded full access to our company's board of directors if any such matter involves an alleged breach of the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics by our Company officers. In addition, our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics emphasizes that all employees, and particularly managers and/or supervisors, have a responsibility for maintaining financial integrity within our company, consistent with generally accepted accounting principles and federal and state securities laws. Any employee who becomes aware of any incidents involving financial or accounting manipulation or other irregularities, whether by witnessing the incident or being told of it, must report it to his or her immediate supervisor or to our company's president or secretary. If the incident involves an alleged breach of the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics by the president or secretary, the incident must be reported to any member of our board of directors. Any failure to report such inappropriate or irregular conduct of others is to be treated as a severe disciplinary matter. It is against our company policy to retaliate against any individual who reports in good faith the violation or potential violation of our company's Code of Business Conduct and Ethics by another. We will provide a copy of the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics to any person without charge, upon request. Requests may be sent in writing to our company, 130 King Street West, Suite 3670, Toronto, Ontario M5X 1A9. 
 Audit Committee and Audit Committee Financial Expert 
 We have no audit committee. 
 Our board of directors has determined that it does not have a member of its audit committee that qualifies as an "audit committee financial expert" as defined in Item 407(d)(5)(ii) of Regulation S-K, and is "independent" as the term is used in Item 7(d)(3)(iv) of Schedule 14A under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. 
 33 
 
 We believe that the members of our audit committee are collectively capable of analyzing and evaluating our financial statements and understanding internal controls and procedures for financial reporting. We believe that retaining an independent director who would qualify as an "audit committee financial expert" would be overly costly and burdensome and is not warranted in our circumstances given the early stages of our development and the fact that we have not generated any material revenues to date. In addition, we currently do not have nominating or compensation committee or committees performing similar functions nor do we have a written nominating or compensation committee charters. Our board of directors does not believe that it is necessary to have such committees because it believes the functions of such committees can be adequately performed by our board of directors. 
 Item 11. Executive Compensation 
 On April 2, 2021, the Company issued 500,000 common shares to the President of the Company in exchange for services rendered. The shares were valued at 0.10 per share. 
 34 
 
 There are no arrangements or plans in which we provide pension, retirement or similar benefits for directors or executive officers. Our directors and executive officers may receive share options at the discretion of our board of directors in the future. We do not have any material bonus or profit-sharing plans pursuant to which cash or non-cash compensation is or may be paid to our directors or executive officers, except that share options may be granted at the discretion of our board of directors. 
 Stock Option Plan 
 On June 30, 2010 our directors approved the adoption of our 2010 Stock Option Plan which permits our company to grant up to 6,500,000 options to acquire shares of common stock, to directors, officers, employees and consultants of our company. 
 Option Exercises 
 During our fiscal year ended August 31, 2021, there were no options exercised by our named officers. 
 Compensation of Directors 
 There are no agreements for compensation with Mr. Larry Faulk or Ian Marshall for their services as Officers or Directors. 
 35 
 
 Pension, Retirement or Similar Benefit Plans 
 There are no arrangements or plans in which we provide pension, retirement or similar benefits for directors or executive officers. We have no material bonus or profit-sharing plans pursuant to which cash or non-cash compensation is or may be paid to our directors or executive officers, except that stock options may be granted at the discretion of the board of directors or a committee thereof. 
 Indebtedness of Directors, Senior Officers, Executive Officers and Other Management 
 None of our directors or executive officers or any associate or affiliate of our company during the last two fiscal years, is or has been indebted to our company by way of guarantee, support agreement, letter of credit or other similar agreement or understanding currently outstanding. 
 Item 12. Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management and Related Stockholder Matters 
 The following table sets forth, as of August 31, 2021, certain information with respect to the beneficial ownership of our common shares by each shareholder known by us to be the beneficial owner of more than 5 of our common shares, as well as by each of our current directors and executive officers as a group. Each person has sole voting and investment power with respect to the shares of common stock, except as otherwise indicated. Beneficial ownership consists of a direct interest in the shares of common stock, except as otherwise indicated.

Based on 15,586,857 shares of common stock issued and outstanding as of August 31, 2021. Except as otherwise indicated, we believe that the beneficial owners of the common shares listed above, based on information furnished by such owners, have sole investment and voting power with respect to such shares, subject to community property laws where applicable. Beneficial ownership is determined in accordance with the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission and generally includes voting or investment power with respect to securities. Shares of common stock subject to options or warrants currently exercisable, or exercisable within 60 days, are deemed outstanding for purposes of computing the percentage ownership of the person holding such option or warrants, but are not deemed outstanding for purposes of computing the percentage ownership of any other person. 

36 
 
 Changes in Control 
 We are unaware of any contract or other arrangement or provisions of our Articles or Bylaws the operation of which may at a subsequent date result in a change of control of our company. There are not any provisions in our Articles or Bylaws, the operation of which would delay, defer, or prevent a change in control of our company. 
 Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence 
 Except as disclosed herein, no director, executive officer, shareholder holding at least 5 of shares of our common stock, or any family member thereof, had any material interest, direct or indirect, in any transaction, or proposed transaction since the year ended August 31, 2012, in which the amount involved in the transaction exceeded or exceeds 120,000. 
 Director Independence 
 We have determined that we do not have a director that is an "independent director" as defined in NASDAQ Marketplace Rule 4200(a)(15). 
 Our board of directors has determined that it does not have a member of its audit committee that qualifies as an "audit committee financial expert" as defined in Item 407(d)(5)(ii) of Regulation S-K, and is "independent" as the term is used in Item 7(d)(3)(iv) of Schedule 14A under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. 
 We believe that retaining an independent director who would qualify as an "audit committee financial expert" would be overly costly and burdensome and is not warranted in our circumstances given the early stages of our development and the fact that we have not generated any material revenues to date. In addition, we currently do not have nominating or compensation committee or committees performing similar functions nor do we have a written nominating or compensation committee charters. Our board of directors does not believe that it is necessary to have such committees because it believes the functions of such committees can be adequately performed by our board of directors. 
 Item 14. Principal Accounting Fees and Services 
 The aggregate fees billed for the most recently completed fiscal year ended August 31, 2021 and for fiscal year ended August 31, 2020 for professional services rendered by the principal accountant for the audit of our annual financial statements and review of the financial statements included in our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and services that are normally provided by the accountant in connection with statutory and regulatory filings or engagements for these fiscal periods were as follows:

 Our board of directors has considered the nature and amount of fees billed by our independent auditors and believes that the provision of services for activities unrelated to the audit is compatible with maintaining our independent auditors' independence.

 EXHIBIT 4.1

Indigenous Roots Corp.: Exhibit 4.1 - Filed by newsfilecorp.com 

INDIGENOUS ROOTS CORP. (the "Corporation") 
 CODE OF ETHICS AND BUSINESS CONDUCT FOR DIRECTORS, SENIOR OFFICERS AND EMPLOYEES OF THE CORPORATION (the "Code") 
 This Code applies to the Chief Executive Officer, President, Chief Financial Officer, Principal Executive Officer, Principal Financial Officer, Principal Accounting Officer, Controller and persons performing similar functions (collectively, the "Senior Officers") along with all directors and employees within the Corporation (the Senior Officers, directors and employees are hereinafter collectively referred to as the "Employees"). This Code covers a wide range of business practices and procedures. It does not cover every issue that may arise, but it sets out basic principles to guide all Employees of the Corporation. All Employees should conduct themselves accordingly and seek to avoid the appearance of improper behaviour in any way relating to the Corporation. 
 Any Employee who has any questions about the Code should consult with the Chief Executive Officer, the President, the Corporation's board of directors (the "Board") or the Corporation's audit committee (the "Audit Committee"). 
 The Corporation has adopted the Code for the purpose of promoting: 
 honest and ethical conduct, including the ethical handling of actual or apparent conflicts of interest between personal and professional relationships; 
 full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in all reports and documents that the Corporation files with, or submits to, the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and in other public communications made by the Corporation that are within the Senior Officer's area of responsibility; 
 compliance with applicable governmental laws, rules and regulations; 
 the prompt internal reporting of violations of the Code; and 
 accountability for adherence to the Code. 
 HONEST AND ETHICAL CONDUCT 
 Each Senior Officer and member of the Board owes a duty to the Corporation to act with integrity. Integrity requires, among other things, being honest and candid. Employees must adhere to a high standard of business ethics and are expected to make decisions and take actions based on the best interests of the Corporation, as a whole, and not based on personal relationships or benefits. Generally, a "conflict of interest" occurs when an Employee's personal interests is, or appears to be, inconsistent with, interferes with or is opposed to the best interests of the Corporation or gives the appearance of impropriety. 
 
 - 2 - 
 Business decisions and actions must be made in the best interests of the Corporation and should not be influenced by personal considerations or relationships. Relationships with the Corporation's stakeholders - for example suppliers, competitors and customers - should not in any way affect an Employee's responsibility and accountability to the Corporation. Conflicts of interest can arise when an Employee or a member of his or her family receive improper gifts, entertainment or benefits as a result of his or her position in the Corporation. 
 Specifically, each Employee must: 

1. 

act with integrity, including being honest and candid while still maintaining the confidentiality of information when required or consistent with the Corporation's policies; 

2. 

avoid violations of the Code, including actual or apparent conflicts of interest with the Corporation in personal and professional relationships; 

3. 

disclose to the Board or the Audit Committee any material transaction or relationship that could reasonably be expected to give rise to a breach of the Code, including actual or apparent conflicts of interest with the Corporation; 

4. 

obtain approval from the Board or Audit Committee before making any decisions or taking any action that could reasonably be expected to involve a conflict of interest or the appearance of a conflict of interest; 

5. 

observe both the form and spirit of laws and governmental rules and regulations, accounting standards and Corporation policies; 

6. 

maintain a high standard of accuracy and completeness in the Corporation's financial records; 

7. 

ensure full, fair, timely, accurate and understandable disclosure in the Corporation's periodic reports; 

8. 

report any violations of the Code to the Board or Audit Committee; 

9. 

proactively promote ethical behaviour among peers in his or her work environment; and 

10. 

maintain the skills appropriate and necessary for the performance of his or her duties. 

DISCLOSURE OF CORPORATION INFORMATION 
 As a result of the Corporation's status as a public company, it is required to file periodic and other reports with the SEC. The Corporation takes its public disclosure responsibility seriously to ensure that these reports furnish the marketplace with full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure regarding the financial and business condition of the Corporation. All disclosures contained in reports and documents filed with or submitted to the SEC, or other government agencies, on behalf of the Corporation or contained in other public communications made by the Corporation must be complete and correct in all material respects and understandable to the intended recipient. 
 
 - 3 - 
 The Senior Officers, in relation to his or her area of responsibility, must be committed to providing timely, consistent and accurate information, in compliance with all legal and regulatory requirements. It is imperative that this disclosure be accomplished consistently during both good times and bad and that all parties in the marketplace have equal or similar access to this information. 
 All of the Corporation's books, records, accounts and financial statements must be maintained in reasonable detail, must appropriately reflect the Corporation's transactions, and must conform both to applicable legal requirements and to the Corporation's system of internal controls. Unrecorded or "off the book" funds, assets or liabilities should not be maintained unless permitted by applicable law or regulation. Senior Officers involved in the preparation of the Corporation's financial statements must prepare those statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, consistently applied, and any other applicable accounting standards and rules so that the financial statements materially, fairly and completely reflect the business transactions and financial statements and related condition of the Corporation. Further, it is important that financial statements and related disclosures be free of material errors. 
 Specifically, each Senior Officer must: 

1. 

familiarize himself or herself with the disclosure requirements generally applicable to the Corporation; 

2. 

not knowingly misrepresent, or cause others to misrepresent, facts about the Corporation to others, including the Corporation's independent auditors, governmental regulators, self-regulating organizations and other governmental officials; 

3. 

to the extent that he or she participates in the creation of the Corporation's books and records, promote the accuracy, fairness and timeliness of those records; and 

4. 

in relation to his or her area of responsibility, properly review and critically analyse proposed disclosure for accuracy and completeness. 

CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION 
 Employees must maintain the confidentiality of confidential information entrusted to them by the Corporation of its customers, suppliers, joint venture partners, or others with whom the Corporation is considering a business or other transaction except when disclosure is authorized by an executive officer or required or mandated by laws or regulations. Confidential information includes all non-public information that might be useful or helpful to competitors or harmful to the Corporation or its customers or suppliers, if disclosed. It also includes information that suppliers, customers and other parties have entrusted to the Corporation. The obligation to preserve confidential information continues even after employment ends. 
 
 - 4 - 
 Records containing personal data about employees or private information about customers and their employees are confidential. They are to be carefully safeguarded, kept current, relevant and accurate. They should be disclosed only to authorized personnel or as required by law. 
 All inquiries regarding the Corporation from non-employees, such as financial analysts and journalists, should be directed to the Board or the Audit Committee. The Corporation's policy is to cooperate with every reasonable request of information from government investigators. At the same time, the Corporation is entitled to all the safeguards provided by law for the benefit of persons under investigation or accused of wrongdoing, including legal representation. If a representative of any government or government agency seeks an interview or requests access to data or documents for the purposes of an investigation, the Employee should refer the representative to the Board or the Audit Committee. Employees also should preserve all materials, including documents and e-mails that might relate to any pending or reasonably possible investigation. 
 COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS 
 The Employees must respect and obey all applicable foreign, federal, state and local laws, rules and regulations applicable to the business and operations of the Corporation. 
 Employees who have access to, or knowledge of, material non-public information from or about the Corporation are prohibited from buying, selling or otherwise trading in the Corporation's stock or other securities. "Material non-public" information includes any information, positive or negative, that has not yet been made available or disclosed to the public and that might be of significance to an investor, as part of the total mix of information, in deciding whether to buy or sell stock or other securities. 
 Employees also are prohibited from giving "tips" on material non-public information, that is directly or indirectly disclosing such information to any other person, including family members, other relatives and friends, so that they may trade in the Corporation's stock or other securities. 
 Furthermore, if, during the course of an Employee's service with the Corporation, he or she acquires material non-public information about another company, such as one of our customers or suppliers, or you learn that the Corporation is planning a major transaction with another company (such as an acquisition), the Employee is restricted from trading in the securities of the other company. 
 REPORTING ACTUAL AND POTENTIAL VIOLATIONS OF THE CODE AND ACCOUNTABILITY FOR COMPLIANCE WITH THE CODE 
 The Corporation, through the Board or the Audit Committee, is responsible for applying this Code to specific situations in which questions may arise and has the authority to interpret this Code in any particular situation. This Code is not intended to provide a comprehensive guideline for Senior Officers in relation to their business activities with the Corporation. Any Employee may seek clarification on the application of this Code from the Board or the Audit Committee. 
 
 - 5 - 
 Each Employee must: 

1. 

notify the Corporation of any existing or potential violation of this Code, and failure to do so is itself a breach of the Code; and 

2. 

not retaliate, directly or indirectly, or encourage others to do so, against any Employee for reports, made in good faith, of any misconduct or violations of the Code solely because that Employee raised a legitimate ethical issue. 

The Board or the Audit Committee will take all action it considers appropriate to investigate any breach of the Code reported to it. All Employees are required to cooperate fully with any such investigations and to provide truthful and accurate information. If the Board or the Audit Committee determines that a breach has occurred, it will take or authorize disciplinary or preventative action as it deems appropriate, after consultation with the Corporation's counsel if warranted, up to and including termination of employment. Where appropriate, the Corporation will not limit itself to disciplinary action but may pursue legal action against the offending Employee involved. In some cases, the Corporation may have a legal or ethical obligation to call violations to the attention of appropriate enforcement authorities. 
 Compliance with the Code may be monitored by audits performed by the Board, Audit Committee, the Corporation's counsel and/or by the Corporation's outside auditors. All Employees are required to cooperate fully with any such audits and to provide truthful and accurate information. 
 Any waiver of this Code for any Employee may be made only by the Board or the Audit Committee and will be promptly disclosed to stockholders and others, as required by applicable law. The Corporation must disclose changes to and waivers of the Code in accordance with applicable law.
