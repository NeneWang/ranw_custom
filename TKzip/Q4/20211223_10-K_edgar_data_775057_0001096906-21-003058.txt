Safe Harbor Statement under the United States 
 Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 
 
 Statements that are not historical facts contained in this Form 10-K are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from projected results. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially include: general economic conditions; movements in interest rates; the market price of oil and natural gas; the risks associated with exploration and production; the Company s ability, or the ability of its operating subsidiary, Altex Oil Corporation (AOC), to find, acquire, market, develop, and produce new properties; operating hazards attendant to the oil and natural gas business; uncertainties in the estimation of proved reserves and in the projection of future rates of production and timing of development expenditures; the strength and financial resources of the Company s competitors; the Company s ability and AOC s ability to find and retain skilled personnel; climatic conditions; availability and cost of material and equipment; delays in anticipated start-up dates; environmental risks; the results of financing efforts; and other uncertainties detailed elsewhere herein. 
 
 PART I 
 
 Item 1. Business. 
 
 Altex Industries, Inc. (or the Registrant or the Company, each of which terms, when used herein, refer to Altex Industries, Inc. and/or its subsidiary) is a holding company with one full-time employee that was incorporated in Delaware in 1985. Through its operating subsidiary, AOC, the Company currently owns interests in productive onshore oil and gas properties, has bought and sold producing oil and gas properties, and, to a lesser extent, has participated in the drilling of exploratory and development wells, and in recompletions of existing wells. 
 
 All of AOC s interests are in properties operated by others. An interest owner in a property not operated by that interest owner must rely on information regarding the property provided by the operator, even though there can be no assurance that such information is complete, accurate, or current. In addition, an owner of a working interest in a property is potentially responsible for 100 of all liabilities associated with that property, regardless of the size of the working interest actually owned. 
 
 The operators of producing properties in which AOC has an interest sell produced oil and gas to refiners, pipeline operators, and processing plants. If a refinery, pipeline, or processing plant that purchases such production were taken out of service, the operator could be forced to halt the production that is purchased by such refinery, pipeline, or plant. 
 
 Although many entities produce oil and gas, competitive factors play a material role in AOC's production operations only to the extent that such factors affect demand for and prices of oil and gas and demand for, supply of, and prices of oilfield services. The sale of oil and gas is regulated by Federal, state, and local agencies, and AOC is also subject to Federal, state, and local laws and regulations relating to the environment. These laws and regulations generally provide for control of pollutants released into the environment and require responsible parties to undertake remediation. AOC regularly assesses its exposure to environmental liability and asset retirement obligations (ARO), which activities are covered by Federal, state, and local regulation. AOC does not believe that it currently has any material exposure to environmental liability or ARO, as it does not own any working interests.

 Item 2. Properties. 
 
 The Company s estimated reserves at September 30, 2021, are 1,000 barrels of proved, developed oil reserves associated with the Company s 4.4 override in the Glo Field in Campbell County, Wyoming. The reserve estimate is prepared by the Company s registered profession petroleum engineer; management supplies the engineer with ownership and revenue data and reviews the reserve estimate for reasonableness. The Company has not reported to, or filed with, any other Federal authority or agency any estimates of total, proved net oil or gas reserves since the beginning of the last fiscal year. All the Company s interests in oil and gas properties are non-working interests. The Company did not participate in the drilling of any wells during the year ended September 30, 2019 (FY19), the year ended September 30, 2020 (FY20), or the year ended September 30, 2021 (FY21). At December 23, 2021, the Company was not engaged in any oil and gas operations. The Company owns very small mineral interests in Utah. All the Company s production is located in Utah and Wyoming.

Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 
 Financial Condition 
 
 In FY21 operating activities used 85,000 cash, and the Company used 19,000 cash to acquire 130,000 shares of its common stock. In FY20 operating activities used 121,000 cash, and the Company used 4,000 cash to acquire 44,008 shares of its common stock. Consequently, cash balances decreased 104,000 in FY21 and 125,000 in FY20. At September 30, 2021 and 2020, accrued expenses, related party, of 1,073,000 consists of 1,024,000 in salary payable to the Company s president, pursuant to his employment agreement, that the president has elected to defer, as well as 49,000 in related accrued payroll tax. The Company s president may require the Company to pay the unpaid salary and payroll tax liability at any time. 
 
 The Company is likely to experience negative cash flow from operations unless and until the Company invests in interests in producing oil and gas wells or in another venture that produces sufficient cash flow from operations. With the exception of capital expenditures related to production acquisitions or drilling or recompletion activities or an investment in another venture that produces cash flow from operations, none of which are currently planned, the cash flows that could result from such acquisitions, activities, or investments, and the possibility of a material change in the current level of interest rates or of oil and gas prices, the Company knows of no trends or demands, commitments, events or uncertainties that will result in or that are reasonably likely to result in the Company's liquidity increasing or decreasing in any material way. Except for cash generated by the operation of the Company's producing oil and gas properties, asset sales, and interest income, the Company has no internal or external sources of liquidity other than its working capital. At December 23, 2021, the Company had no material commitments for capital expenditures. 
 
 Results of Operations 
 
 Oil and gas sales increased from 31,000 in FY20 to 44,000 in FY21 because quantities sold and prices received increased in FY21. Interest income decreased from 17,000 in FY20 to nil in FY21 because of lower realized interest rates on cash balances. Included in other income in FY21 was 56,000 in out-of-period revenue that had been held in suspense. 
 
 At the current levels of net oil and gas production, cash balances, interest rates, and oil and gas prices, the Company s revenue is unlikely to exceed its expenses. Unless and until the Company invests a substantial portion of its cash balances in interests in producing oil and gas wells or in one or more other ventures that produce revenue and net income, the Company is likely to experience net losses. With the exception of unanticipated ARO, unanticipated environmental expense, and possible changes in interest rates and oil and gas prices, the Company is not aware of any other trends, events, or uncertainties that have had or that are reasonably expected to have a material impact on net sales or revenues or income from continuing operations.

 Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure.

Item 9A. Controls and Procedures 
 
 The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the Company s Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including its Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management necessarily applied its judgment in assessing the costs and benefits of such controls and procedures which, by their nature, can provide only reasonable assurance regarding management s control objectives. 
 
 As of the end of the period covered by the report, the Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s management, including the Company s Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 13a-14. Based upon the foregoing, the Company s Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures are effective in timely alerting them to material information relating to the Company (including its consolidated subsidiary) required to be included in the Company s Exchange Act reports. There have been no significant changes in the Company s internal controls or in other factors which could significantly affect internal controls subsequent to the date the Company carried out its evaluation.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders 
 Altex Industries, Inc. 
 
 Opinion on the Financial Statements 
 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Altex Industries, Inc. (the Company) as of September 30, 2021 and 2020, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders equity, and cash flows for the years then ended, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements ). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of September 30, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
 
 Basis for Opinion 
 
 These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB . 
 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 
 
 Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and the significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 
 Critical Audit Matter 
 
 The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. 
 
 Revenue Recognition 
 
 As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company recognizes revenue in accordance with ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. Revenue from oil and gas production is recognized based on the sales date as reported to the Company by the operators of oil and gas production facilities in which the Company has a royalty interest. 
 
 Auditing management s evaluation of the royalty revenue from its agreements with customers involves significant judgment based on the estimates of the revenue recorded and their subsequent true-up once payment is received. 
 To evaluate the appropriateness and accuracy of the revenue recorded by management, we evaluated management s assessment of the revenue recorded based on the Company s royalty interest.
