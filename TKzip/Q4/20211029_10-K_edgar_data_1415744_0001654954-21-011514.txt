Forward-Looking Statements 

Certain
statements, other than purely historical information, including
estimates, projections, statements relating to our business plans,
objectives, and expected operating results, and the assumptions
upon which those statements are based, are forward-looking
statements. These forward-looking statements generally are
identified by the words believes, 
 project, expects, 
 anticipates, estimates, 
 intends, strategy, plan, 
 may, will, would, 
 will be, will continue, will
likely result, and similar expressions. Forward-looking
statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that
are subject to risks and uncertainties which may cause actual
results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements.
Our ability to predict results or the actual effect of future plans
or strategies is inherently uncertain. Factors which could have a
material adverse effect on our operations and future prospects
include, but are not limited to: changes in economic conditions,
legislative/regulatory changes, availability of capital, interest
rates, competition, and generally accepted accounting principles.
These risks and uncertainties should also be considered in
evaluating forward-looking statements and undue reliance should not
be placed on such statements. 

Our Corporate History and Background 

We were incorporated on December 11, 2006 under the laws of the
State of Nevada. 

We were originally a company involved in the placing of strength
testing amusement gaming machines called Boxers in venues such as
bars, pubs and nightclubs in the Seattle area, in the State of
Washington. We acquired one Boxer that had been placed in Lynnwood,
Washington. However, the machine was de-commissioned as it needed
material repairs. We were not able to secure sufficient capital for
these repairs and our management decided to change our business
focus to oil and gas and mineral exploration. On July 12,
2013, the stockholders approved an amendment to change the name of
the Company from Punchline Resources Ltd. to Northern Mineral 
Exploration Ltd. FINRA approved the name change on August 13,
2013. 

Northern
Minerals Exploration Ltd. (the Company is an
emerging natural resource company operating in oil and gas
production in central Texas and exploration for gold and silver in
northern Nevada. 

On
November 22, 2017, the Company created a wholly owned subsidiary,
Kathis Energy LLC Kathis ), a duly formed Limited
Liability Company formed in the State of Texas, for the purpose of
conducting oil and gas drilling programs in Texas. 

On
December 14, 2017, Kathis Energy, LLC and other Limited Partners,
created Kathis Energy Fund 1, LP, a duly formed Limited Partnership
formed in the State of Texas, created for the purpose of raising
funds from investors for its drilling projects. There was no
activity with Kathis Energy, LLC during 2021 fiscal
year. 

On May
7, 2018, the Company created a wholly owned subsidiary, ENMEX
Operations LLC ENMEX ), a duly formed Limited
Liability Company in the State of Quintana Roo, Mexico for the
purpose of conducting business in Mexico in prospective real estate
development projects. There has been no activity from inception to
date. 

Current Business 

Refer to NOTE 4 and NOTE 5 for property information. 

Oil Gas Sector 

Competition 

The petroleum industry is highly competitive. Many of the oil and
gas exploration companies with whom we compete have greater
financial and technical resources than we do. Accordingly, these
competitors may be able to spend greater amounts on acquisitions of
properties of merit and on exploration. In addition, they may be
able to afford greater geological expertise in the targeting and
exploration of resource properties. This competition could result
in our competitors having resource properties of greater quality
and interest to prospective investors who may finance additional
exploration, and to senior exploration companies that may purchase
resource properties or enter into joint venture agreements with
junior exploration companies. This competition could adversely
impact our ability to finance property acquisitions and further
exploration. 

2 

We compete with other exploration and early stage operating
companies for financing from a limited number of investors prepared
to make investments in junior companies exploring for conventional
and unconventional oil and gas resources. The presence of competing
oil and gas exploration companies, both major and independent, may
impact our ability to raise additional capital in order to fund our
exploration programs if investors are of the view that investments
in competitors are more attractive based on the merit of the
properties under investigation, and the price of the investment
offered to investors. 

Governmental Regulation 

Our business is affected by numerous laws and regulations,
including energy, environmental, conservation, tax and other laws
and regulations relating to the oil and natural gas industry. We
have developed internal procedures and policies to ensure that our
operations are conducted in full and substantial environmental
regulatory compliance. 

Failure to comply with any laws and regulations may result in the
assessment of administrative, civil and/or criminal penalties, the
imposition of injunctive relief or both. Moreover, changes in any
of these laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect
on business. In view of the many uncertainties with respect to
current and future laws and regulations, including their
applicability to us, we cannot predict the overall effect of such
laws and regulations on our future operations. 

We believe that our operations comply in all material respects with
applicable laws and regulations and that the existence and
enforcement of such laws and regulations have no more restrictive
an effect on our operations than on other similar companies in the
oil and natural gas industry. 

Pricing and Marketing of Natural Gas 

In the US, historically, the sale of natural gas in interstate
commerce has been regulated pursuant to the Natural Gas Act of
1938, or the NGA, the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978, or the NGPA,
and regulations promulgated thereunder by the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission, or the FERC. In 1989, Congress enacted the
Natural Gas Wellhead Decontrol Act, or the Decontrol Act. The
Decontrol Act removed all NGA and NGPA price and non-price controls
affecting wellhead sales of natural gas effective January 1, 1993
and sales by producers of natural gas are uncontrolled and can be
made at market prices. The natural gas industry historically has
been heavily regulated and from time to time proposals are
introduced by Congress and the FERC and judicial decisions are
rendered that impact the conduct of business in the natural gas
industry. We cannot assure you that the less stringent regulatory
approach recently pursued by the FERC and Congress will
continue. 

Pricing and Marketing of Oil 

In the US, sales of crude oil, condensate and natural gas liquids
are not regulated and are made at negotiated prices. Effective
January 1, 1995, the FERC implemented regulations establishing an
indexing system for transportation rates for oil that allowed for
an increase in the cost of transporting oil to the
purchaser. 

Environmental 

Like the oil and natural gas industry in general, our properties
are subject to extensive and changing federal, state and local laws
and regulations designed to protect and preserve natural resources
and the environment. The recent trend in environmental legislation
and regulation in the oil and natural gas industry is generally
toward stricter standards, and this trend is likely to continue.
These laws and regulations often require a permit or other
authorization before construction or drilling commences and for
certain other activities; limit or prohibit access, especially in
wilderness areas with endangered or threatened plant or animal
species; impose restrictions on construction, drilling and other
exploration and production activities; regulate air emissions,
wastewater and other production and waste streams from our
operations; impose substantial liabilities for pollution that may
result from our operations; and require the reclamation of certain
lands. 

The permits required for many of our operations are subject to
revocation, modification and renewal by issuing authorities.
Governmental authorities have the power to enforce compliance with
their regulations, and violations are subject to fines, compliance
orders, and other enforcement actions. We are not aware of any
material noncompliance with current applicable environmental laws
and regulations, and we have no material commitments for capital
expenditures to comply with existing environmental requirements,
however, given the complex regulatory requirements applicable to
our operations, and the rapidly changing nature of environmental
laws in our industry, we cannot predict our future exposure
concerning such matters, and our future costs to achieve
compliance, or remedy potential violations, could be significant.
Our operations require permits and are regulated under
environmental laws, and current or future noncompliance with such
laws, as well as changes to existing laws or interpretations
thereof, could have a significant impact on us, as well as the oil
and natural gas industry in general.

Waste Disposal and Contamination Issues 

The federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and
Liability Act and comparable state laws may impose strict and joint
and several liability on owners and operators of contaminated sites
and on persons who disposed of or arranged for the disposal of
hazardous substances found at such sites. Under these and other
laws, the government, neighboring landowners and other third
parties may recover the costs of responding to soil and groundwater
contamination and threatened releases of hazardous substances, and
seek recovery for related natural resources damages, personal
injury and property damage. Some of our properties have been used
for exploration and production activities for a number of years by
third parties, and such properties could result in unknown cleanup
liabilities for us. 

The federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (the "RCRA") and
comparable state statutes govern the management, storage, treatment
and disposal of solid waste and hazardous waste and authorize
imposition of substantial fines and penalties for noncompliance.
Although RCRA classifies certain oil field wastes as
"non-hazardous" (for example, the waters produced from hydraulic
fracturing operations), such wastes could be reclassified as
hazardous wastes in the future, thereby making them subject to more
stringent handling and disposal requirements which could have a
material impact on us. 

Water Regulation 

The federal Clean Water Act (the "CWA"), the federal Safe Drinking
Water Act (the "SWDA") and analogous state laws restrict the
discharge of wastewater and other pollutants into surface waters or
underground wells and the construction of facilities in wetland
areas without a permit. Federal regulations also require certain
owners or operators of facilities that store or otherwise handle
oil, such as us, to prepare and implement spill prevention, control
countermeasure and response plans relating to the possible
discharge of oil into surface waters. In addition, the Oil
Pollution Act (the "OPA") contains numerous requirements relating
to the prevention of and response to oil spills into waters of the
United States. For onshore and offshore facilities that may affect
waters of the United States, the OPA requires an operator to
demonstrate financial responsibility. Regulations are currently
being developed or considered under federal and state laws
concerning oil pollution prevention and other matters that may
impose additional regulatory burdens on us. 

These and similar state laws also govern the management and
disposal of produced waters from the extraction process. Currently,
wastewater associated with oil and natural gas production is
prohibited from being directly discharged to waterways and other
waters of the U.S. While some of the wastewater is reused or
re-injected, a significant amount still requires proper disposal.
As a result, some wastewater is transported to third-party
treatment plants. In October 2011, citing concerns that third-party
treatment plants may not be properly equipped to handle wastewater
from shale gas operations, the United States Environmental
Protection Agency (the "EPA") announced that it will consider
federal pre-treatment standards for these wastewaters. We cannot
predict the EPA's future actions in this regard, but future
regulation of our produced waters or other waste streams could have
a material impact on us. 

Air Emissions and Climate Change 

The federal Clean Air Act ("CAA") imposes permit requirements and
operational restrictions on certain sources of emissions used in
our operations. In July 2011, the EPA published proposed New Source
Performance Standards ("NSPS") and National Emissions Standards for
Hazardous Air Pollutants ("NESHAPs") that would, if adopted, amend
existing NSPS and NESHAP standards for oil and natural gas
facilities and create new NSPS standards for oil and natural gas
production, transmission and distribution facilities. Importantly,
these standards would include standards for hydraulically fractured
wells. The standards would apply to newly drilled and fractured
wells as well as existing wells that are refractured. A court has
directed the EPA to issue final rules by April 1, 2012. In a report
issued in late 2011, the Shale Gas Production Subcommittee of the
Department of Energy (the "DOE Shale Gas Subcommittee") called on
the EPA to complete the rulemaking quickly and recommended
expanding the shale gas emission sources to be covered by the new
rules. The DOE Shale Gas Subcommittee also encouraged states to
take similar action, and included several other recommendations for
studying and reducing air emissions from shale gas production
activities. Because the EPA's regulations have not yet been
finalized, we cannot at this time predict the impact they may have
on our financial condition or results of operation. 

4 

The issue of climate change has received increasing regulatory
attention in recent years. The EPA has issued regulations governing
carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gas ("GHG") emissions
citing its authority under the CAA Several of these regulations
have been challenged in litigation that is currently pending before
the federal D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. In December 2011, the
EPA issued amendments to a final rule issued in 2010 requiring
reporting of GHG emissions from the oil and natural gas industry.
Under this rule, we are obligated to report to the EPA certain GHG
emissions from our operations. We do not expect that the costs of
this new reporting will be material to us. In a late 2011 report,
the DOE Shale Gas Subcommittee recommended that the EPA expand
reporting requirements for GHG emissions from shale gas emission
sources and include methane in reporting requirements. More
generally, several proposals to regulate GHG emissions have been
proposed in the U.S. Congress, and various states have taken steps
to regulate GHG emissions. The adoption and implementation of
regulations or legislation imposing restrictions or other
regulatory obligations on emissions of GHGs from oil and natural
gas operations could require us to obtain permits or allowances for
our GHG emissions, install new pollution controls, increase our
operational costs, limit our operations or adversely affect demand
for the oil and natural gas produced from our lands. 

Research and Development Expenditures 

We have not incurred any research and development expenditures over
the past two fiscal years. 

Employees 

As of July 31, 2021, we do not

ITEM 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANT'S COMMON EQUITY, R ELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF
EQUITY SECURITIES 

Market Information 

Our
common stock is quoted under the symbol NMEX on the
OTCPINK operated by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority,
Inc. FINRA and the OTCQB operated by OTC Markets
Group, Inc. Few market makers continue to participate in the
OTCBB system because of high fees charged by FINRA. The
criteria for listing on either the OTCBB or OTCQB are similar and
include that we remain current in our SEC reporting. 

5 

Our
shares are subject to Section 15(g) and Rule 15g-9 of the
Securities and Exchange Act, commonly referred to as the
 penny stock rule. The rule defines penny stock
to be any equity security that has a market price less than 5.00
per share, subject to certain exceptions. These rules may restrict
the ability of broker-dealers to trade or maintain a market in our
common stock and may affect the ability of shareholders to sell
their shares. Broker-dealers who sell penny stocks to persons
other than established customers and accredited investors must make
a special suitability determination for the purchase of the
security. Accredited investors, in general, include individuals
with assets in excess of 1,000,000 (not including their personal
residence) or annual income exceeding 200,000 or 300,000 together
with their spouse, and certain institutional investors. The rules
require the broker-dealer to receive the purchaser s written
consent to the transaction prior to the purchase and require the
broker-dealer to deliver a risk disclosure document relating to the
penny stock prior to the first transaction. A broker-dealer also
must disclose the commissions payable to both the broker-dealer and
the registered representative, and current quotations for the
security. Finally, monthly statements must be sent to
customers disclosing recent price information for the penny
stocks. 

On
October 11, 2021 there were approximately 81 holders of record of
our common stock, although there may be other persons who are
beneficial owners of our common stock held in street name. The
transfer agent and registrar for our common stock is Issuer Direct
Corporation, 1981 Murray Holiday Road, #100, Salt Lake City, UT
84117. 

Dividend Policy 

We have
never paid any cash dividends and intend, for the foreseeable
future, to retain any future earnings for the development of our
business. Our Board of Directors will determine our future dividend
policy on the basis of various factors, including our results of
operations, financial condition, capital requirements and
investment opportunities. 

RECENT ISSUANCES OF UNREGISTERED SECURITIES 

During the year ended July 31, 2021, the Company sold 2,667,200
shares of common stock at 0.03 per share for total cash
proceeds of 50,000. 

On July 31, 2021, the Company issued 250,000 shares of common stock
in conversion of a 25,000 accounts payable. The shares were value

I TEM 7. MANAGEMENT S
DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF
OPERATIONS 

Results of Operations for the Years Ended July 31, 2021 and
2020 

Revenue 

Revenues
of oil and gas for the years ended July 31, 2021 and 2020 were 0
and 2,949, respectively, a decrease of 2,949. Revenues are earned
primarily from the J.E. Richey Lease from the sale of oil and gas
and are recorded net of any distributions paid. The decrease in revenue
is due to lower production as well as lower oil and gas
prices. 

6 

Officer compensation 

Officer
compensation was 26,400 and 6,600 for the years ended July 31,
2021 and 2020, respectively, an increase of 19,800. We began to
incur monthly compensation expense for our new CFO in April 2020
and no compensation has been accrued or paid to the CEO in the
current period. 

Consulting related party 

Consulting
 related party services were 60,000 and 60,000 for the
years ended July 31, 2021 and 2020. Fees are paid to Noel Schaefer,
Director, but are billed as consulting fees. 

Consulting expense 

Consulting fees were 8,000 and 12,700 for the years ended
July 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, a decrease of 4,700, or
37 . When
needed the Company hires experts in the mining, oil and gas
industries to assist with its current projects. 

Professional fees 

Professional
fees were 49,566 and 53,523 for the years ended July 31, 2021 and
2020, respectively, a decrease of 3,957, or 7 . Professional fees
generally consist of legal, audit and accounting expense.
 The
decrease can be attributed to a decrease in accounting fees that
was offset with an increase in audit fees. 

Mineral property expenditures 

Mineral
property expenditures were 1,000 and 35,669 for the years ended
July 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, a decrease of 34,669, or
97 . Expenditures include lease payments for the working interest
in the mineral properties and rework expense. The decrease in in the
current period can be attributed to a decrease in expenditures
while the Company pursues additional funding. 

General and administrative 

General
and administrative expense was 32,944 and 22,384 for the years
ended July 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, an increase of
 10,560. 

Other expense 

During
the year ended July 31, 2021 we had total other expense of 65,058
compared to 152,910 in the prior year. During the current year we
incurred interest expense of 93,017, which included a 72,631
expense for the issuance of warrnates on a loan conversion , a loss
on the impairment of oil rights of 28,800 and a loss on debt

Northern Minerals Exploration Ltd. 

N otes to Consolidated Financial
Statements 

July 31, 2021 

NOTE 1 - ORGANIZATION AND BUSINESS OPERATIONS 

Northern
Minerals Exploration Ltd. (the Company is an
emerging natural resource company operating in oil and gas
production in central Texas and exploration for gold and silver in
northern Nevada. 

The
Company was incorporated in Nevada on December 11, 2006 under the
name Punchline Entertainment, Inc. On August 22, 2012, the
Company s board of directors approved an agreement and plan
of merger to effect a name change of the Company from Punchline
Entertainment, Inc. to Punchline Resources Ltd. On July 12, 2013,
the stockholders approved an amendment to change the name of the
Company from Punchline Resources Ltd. to Northern Mineral 
Exploration Ltd. FINRA approved the name change on August 13,
2013. 

On
November 22, 2017, the Company created a wholly owned subsidiary,
Kathis Energy LLC Kathis for the purpose of
conducting oil and gas drilling programs in Texas. 

On
December 14, 2017, Kathis Energy, LLC and other Limited Partners,
created Kathis Energy Fund 1, LP, a limited partnership created for
raising investor funds. 

On May
7, 2018, the Company created ENMEX LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary
in Mexico, for the purposes of managing and operating its
investments in Mexico including but not limited to the Joint
Venture opportunity being negotiated with Pemer Bacalar on the 61
acres on the Bacalar Lagoon on the Yucatan Peninsula. There was no
activity from inception to date. 

NOTE 2 - SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 

Basis of presentation 

The
accounting and reporting policies of the Company conform to U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles (US GAAP). 

Use of estimates 

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the
reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
period. Actual results may differ from those
estimates. 

Cash and Cash Equivalents 

The Company considers all cash accounts, which are not subject to
withdrawal restrictions or penalties, and all highly liquid debt
instruments purchased with a maturity of three months or less as
cash and cash equivalents. The carrying amount of financial
instruments included in cash and cash equivalents approximates fair
value because of the short maturities for the instruments
held. The Company had no cash equivalents as of July 31, 2021
and 2020. 

Principles of Consolidation 

The
accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts
of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Kathis Energy
LLC, Kathis Energy Fund 1, LLP and Enmex Operations LLC. All
financial information has been prepared in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America. All significant intercompany transactions and balances
have been eliminated. 

Revenue Recognition 

Revenue
is recognized when a customer obtains control of promised goods or
services and is recognized in an amount that reflects the
consideration that an entity expects to receive in exchange for
those goods or services. In addition, the standard requires
disclosure of the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of
revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. The
amount of revenue that is recorded reflects the consideration that
the Company expects to receive in exchange for those goods. The
Company applies the following five-step model in order to determine
this amount: (i) identification of the promised goods in the
contract; (ii) determination of whether the promised goods are
performance obligations, including whether they are distinct in the
context of the contract; (iii) measurement of the transaction
price, including the constraint on variable consideration; (iv)
allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations;
and (v) recognition of revenue when (or as) the Company satisfies
each performance obligation. 

F-7 

The Company only applies the five-step model to contracts
when it is probable that the entity will collect the consideration
it is entitled to in exchange for the goods or services it
transfers to the customer. Once a contract is determined to be
within the scope of ASC 606 at contract inception, the Company
reviews the contract to determine which performance obligations the
Company must deliver and which of these performance obligations are
distinct. The Company recognizes as revenues the amount of the
transaction price that is allocated to the respective performance
obligation when the performance obligation is satisfied or as it is
satisfied. Generally, the Company s performance obligations
are transferred to customers at a point in time, typically upon
delivery. 

Accounts Receivable 

Revenues that have been recognized but not yet received are
recorded as accounts receivable. Losses on receivables will be
recognized when it is more likely than not that a receivable will
not be collected. An allowance for estimated uncollectible amounts
will be recognized to reduce the amount of receivables to its net
realizable value. The allowance for uncollectible amounts is
evaluated quarterly. 

Long Lived Assets 

Property
consists of mineral rights purchases as stipulated by underlying
agreements and payments made for oil and gas exploration rights.
Our company assesses the impairment of long-lived assets whenever
events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value
may not be recoverable. When we determine that the carrying value
of long-lived assets may not be recoverable based upon the
existence of one or more indicators of impairment and the carrying
value of the asset cannot be recovered from projected undiscounted
cash flows, we record an impairment charge. Our company measures
any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method
using a discount rate determined by management to be commensurate
with the risk inherent in the current business model. Significant
management judgment is required in determining whether an indicator
of impairment exists and in projecting cash flows. 

Mineral Property Acquisition and Exploration Costs 

Mineral
property acquisition and exploration costs are expensed as incurred
until such time as economic reserves are quantified. Cost of lease,
exploration, carrying and retaining unproven mineral lease
properties are expensed as incurred. We have chosen to expense all
mineral exploration costs as incurred given that it is still in the
exploration stage. Once our company has identified proven and
probable reserves in its investigation of its properties and upon
development of a plan for operating a mine, it would enter the
development stage and capitalize future costs until production is
established. When a property reaches the production stage, the
related capitalized costs will be amortized over the estimated life
of the probable-proven reserves. When our company has capitalized
mineral properties, these properties will be periodically assessed
for impairment of value and any diminution in value. 

Oil and Gas Properties 

The
Company follows the successful efforts method of accounting for its
oil and gas properties. Under this method of accounting, all
property acquisition costs and costs of exploratory and development
wells are capitalized when incurred, pending determination of
whether the well found proved reserves. If an exploratory well does
not find proved reserves, the costs of drilling the well are
charged to expense. The costs of development wells are capitalized
whether those wells are successful or unsuccessful. Other
exploration costs, including certain geological and geophysical
expenses and delay rentals for oil and gas leases, are charged to
expense as incurred. Maintenance and repairs are charged to
expense, and renewals and betterments are capitalized to the
appropriate property and equipment accounts. Depletion and
amortization of oil and gas properties are computed on a
well-by-well basis using the units-of-production method. Although
the Company has recognized minimal levels of production and
revenue, none of its property have proved reserves. Therefore, the
Company s properties are designated as unproved
properties. 

Unproved
property costs are not subject to amortization and consist
primarily of leasehold costs related to unproved areas. Unproved
property costs are transferred to proved properties if the
properties are subsequently determined to be productive and are
assigned proved reserves. Proceeds from sales of partial interest
in unproved leases are accounted for as a recovery of cost without
recognizing any gain until all cost is recovered. Unproved
properties are assessed periodically for impairment based on
remaining lease terms, drilling results, reservoir performance,
commodity price outlooks or future plans to develop
acreage. 

Asset Retirement Obligation 

Accounting
Standards Codification ASC Topic 410, Asset
Retirement and Environmental Obligations ASC 410 requires an entity to recognize the fair value of a liability for
an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is
incurred. The net estimated costs are discounted to present values
using credit-adjusted, risk-free rate over the estimated economic
life of the oil and gas properties. Such costs are capitalized as
part of the related asset. The asset is depleted on the equivalent
unit-of-production method based upon estimates of proved oil and
natural gas reserves. The liability is periodically adjusted to
reflect (1) new liabilities incurred, (2) liabilities settled
during the period, (3) accretion expense and (4) revisions to
estimated future cash flow requirements. To date, the Company has
very few operating wells. Currently, the Company has one working
well. Because there is only one active well on the Ritchie Lease
with a 24 working interest, the Company estimates the asset
retirement obligation to be trivial and has not recorded an ARO
liability. 

F-8 

Basic and Diluted Earnings Per Share 

Net
income (loss) per common share is computed pursuant to ASC
260-10-45, Earnings per
Share Overall Other Presentation Matters . Basic
net income (loss) per common share is computed by dividing net
income (loss) by the weighted average number of shares of common
stock outstanding during the period. Diluted net income (loss) per
common share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the
weighted average number of shares of common stock and potentially
outstanding shares of common stock during the period. 

For the
year ended July 31, 2021 , the
Company had 1,911,330 of potentially dilutive shares from warrants.
For the year ended July 31,
2020 , the Company had 3,031,958 of potentially dilutive
shares. The shares consisted of common shares and warrants from
convertible debt of 1,687,972 and 843,986, respectively, and an
additional 500,000 warrants. The diluted loss per share is the same
as the basic loss per share for the years ended July 31, 2021 and
2020, as the inclusion of any potential shares would have had an
antidilutive effect due to our loss from operations. 

Recently issued accounting pronouncements 

In
November 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-10, Financial
Instruments Credit Losses (Topic 326), Derivative and Hedging
(Topic 815), and Leases (Topic 842). This new guidance became
effective for us on January 1, 2020. The adoption of this guidance
did not have a material impact on the Company s consolidated
financial statements. 

On January 1, 2020 the Company adopted ASU
2017-04, Intangibles - Goodwill and
Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill
Impairment . The ASU eliminates
Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test and the qualitative
assessment for any reporting unit with a zero or negative carrying
amount. The ASU also requires an entity to disclose the amount of
goodwill allocated to each reporting unit with a zero or negative
carrying amount. The adoption did not have an impact on the
Company s consolidated financial
statements. 

In August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06 , Debt Debt with
Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and
Hedging Contracts in Entity s Own Equity (Subtopic
815-40) Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts
in an Entity s Own Equity. ASU 2020-06 reduces the number of accounting
models for convertible debt instruments and convertible preferred
stock. For convertible instruments with conversion features that
are not required to be accounted for as derivatives under Topic
815, Derivatives and
Hedging , or that do not result
in substantial premiums accounted for as paid-in capital, the
embedded conversion features no longer are separated from the host
contract. ASU 2020-06 also removes certain conditions that should
be considered in the derivatives scope exception evaluation under
Subtopic 815-40, Derivatives and
Hedging Contracts in Entity s Own
Equity , and clarify the scope
and certain requirements under Subtopic 815-40. In addition, ASU
2020-06 improves the guidance related to the disclosures and
earnings-per-share (EPS) for convertible instruments and contract
in entity s own equity. ASU 2020-06 is effective for public
business entities that meet the definition of a Securities and
Exchange Commission (SEC) filer, excluding entities eligible to be
smaller reporting companies as defined by the SEC, for fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 2021, including interim periods within
those fiscal years. For all other entities, the amendments are
effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023,
including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption
is permitted, but no earlier than fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2020, including interim periods within those fiscal
years. The Board specified that an entity should adopt the guidance
as of the beginning of its annual fiscal year. The Company is
currently evaluation the impact this ASU will have on its
consolidated financial statements. 

The
Company has implemented all new accounting pronouncements that are
in effect. These pronouncements did not have any material impact on
the financial statements unless otherwise disclosed, and the
Company does not believe that there are any other new accounting
pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material
impact on its financial position or results of
operations. 

NOTE 3 - GOING CONCERN 

The
accompanying financial statements are prepared and presented on a
going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets
and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of
business. Accordingly, they do not include any adjustments relating
to the realization of the carrying value of assets or the amounts
and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should
the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. Since
inception to July 31, 2021, the Company has an accumulated deficit
of 3,242,058. The Company intends to fund operations through
equity financing arrangements, which may be insufficient to fund
its capital expenditures, working capital and other cash
requirements for the next twelve months. These factors, among
others, raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability
to continue as a going concern. The accompanying financial
statements do not include any adjustments that might result from
the outcome of this uncertainty.

NOTE 5 WINNEMUCCA MOUNTAIN PROPERTY 

On
September 14, 2012, we entered into an option agreement with AHL

Optioners. This agreement provided for the payment of 25,000 and
the issuance of 3,000,000 shares of the Company s common
stock and work commitments. The Company issued the shares and made
the initial payment of 25,000 per the terms of the July 31, 2018
agreement. The second payment of 25,000 per the terms of the

causing the Company to default on the terms of the July 23, 2018
agreement. 

On

earn an 80 interest in the Property, these terms include cash
payments, issuance of common shares of the Company and work
commitments.

Gold Property has been terminated for being in default of certain
terms and conditions of the Agreement. Management is in discussions
with the principals of the Winnemucca property to resolve any
outstanding obligations.

NOTE 12 - INCOME TAX 

Deferred
taxes are provided on a liability method whereby deferred tax
assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences and
operating loss and tax credit carry forwards and deferred tax
liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences.
Temporary differences are the differences between the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases. Deferred tax
assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of
management, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of
the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Deferred tax assets
and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws
and rates on the date of enactment. The U.S. federal income tax
rate of 21 is being used for 2017 due to the new tax law recently
enacted. 

The
provision for Federal income tax consists of the following July

- 

At July
31, 2021, the Company had net operating loss carry forwards of
approximately 964,100 that maybe offset against future taxable
income. No tax benefit has been reported in the July 31,
2021 or 2020 financial statements since the potential tax benefit
is offset by a valuation allowance of the same
amount. 

On
December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax
legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cut and Jobs Act (the
 Tax Act ). The Tax Act establishes new tax laws that
affects 2018 and future years, including a reduction in the U.S.
federal corporate income tax rate to 21 effective January 1, 2018.
For certain deferred tax assets and deferred tax
liabilities. 

Due to
the change in ownership provisions of the Tax Reform Act of 1986,
net operating loss carry forwards for Federal income tax reporting
purposes are subject to annual limitations. Should a change in
ownership occur, net operating loss carry forwards may be limited
as to use in future years. 

ASC
Topic 740 provides guidance on the accounting for uncertainty in
income taxes recognized in a company s financial statements.
Topic 740 requires a company to determine whether it is more likely
than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination
based upon the technical merits of the position. If the
more-likely-than-not threshold is met, a company must measure the
tax position to determine the amount to recognize in the financial
statements. 

F-13 

The
Company includes interest and penalties arising from the
underpayment of income taxes in the statements of operations in the
provision for income taxes. As of July 31, 2021, the Company had no
accrued interest or penalties related to uncertain tax positions.
The Company is subject to examination
by the various taxing authorities beginning with the tax year ended
December 31, 2017 (or the tax year ended December 31, 2003 if the
Company were to utilize its NOLs) 

NOTE 13 - SUBSEQUENT EVENTS 

Management
has evaluated subsequent events pursuant to the requirements of ASC
Topic 855, from the balance sheet date through the date the
financial statements were available to be issued, and has
determined that no material subsequent events exist other than the
following. 

Subsequent
to July 31, 2021, the Company issued the 600,000 due to
 Mr. Miranda. In addition, Mr. Miranda
purchased as an additional 2,100,000 shares for
 63,000. 

Subsequent
to July 31, 2021, the Company sold 50,000 shares of common stock
for total proceeds of 5,000. 

Subsequent
to July 31, 2021, note holders converted 48,400 into 484,000
shares of common stock.

I TEM 9A. CONTROLS AND
PROCEDURES 

Management s Report Disclosure Controls and
Procedures 

We carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the
participation of our management, including our principal executive
officer and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of
our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act
Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)). Based upon that
evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial
officer concluded that, as of the end of the period covered in this
report, our disclosure controls and procedures were ineffective to
ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports filed
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the required time periods
specified in the Commission s rules and forms and is
accumulated and communicated to our management, including our
principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as
appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure. 

Our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, do
not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our
internal controls will prevent all error or fraud. A
control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can
provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the
objectives of the control system are met. Further, the
design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are
resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be
considered relative to their costs. Due to the inherent
limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can
provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of
fraud, if any, have been detected. During the fourth quarter
of the fiscal year ended July 31, 2020, we carried out an
evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our
principal executive officer and principal financial officer, of the
effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure
controls and procedures. Based on that evaluation and due to
the identified material weaknesses discussed below, our principal
executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that
our disclosure controls and procedures were ineffective as of the
end of the period covered by this report. 

To address the material weaknesses, we performed additional
analysis and other post-closing procedures in an effort to ensure
our financial statements included in this annual report have been
prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles. Accordingly, management believes that the
financial statements included in this report fairly present in all
material respects our financial condition, results of operations
and cash flows for the periods presented. 

Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial
Reporting 

Internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules
13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) is a process
designed by, or under the supervision of, our principal executive
and principal financial officers, and effected by our board of
directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate
internal control over our financial reporting. Under the
supervision and with the participation of our management, including
our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we
conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal
control over financial reporting using the Internal Control 
Integrated Framework (2013) developed by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation,
our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have
concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was
not effective as of July 31, 2021. 

We are aware of the following material weaknesses in internal
control that could adversely affect the Company s ability to
record, process, summarize and report financial data: 

Due to our size and limited resources, we currently do not employ
the appropriate accounting personnel to ensure (a) we maintain
proper segregation of duties, (b) that all transactions are entered
timely and accurately, and (c) we properly account for complex or
unusual transactions 

Due to our size and limited resources, we have not properly
documented a complete assessment of the effectiveness of the design
and operation of our internal control over financial
reporting. 

9 

I nherent limitations on
effectiveness of controls 

Internal control over financial reporting has inherent limitations,
which include but is not limited to the use of independent
professionals for advice and guidance, interpretation of existing
and/or changing rules and principles, segregation of management
duties, scale of organization, and personnel factors. Internal
control over financial reporting is a process, which involves human
diligence and compliance and is subject to lapses in judgment and
breakdowns resulting from human failures. Internal control over
financial reporting also can be circumvented by collusion or
improper management override. Because of its inherent limitations,
internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect
misstatements on a timely basis, however these inherent limitations
are known features of the financial reporting process and it is
possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce, though
not eliminate, this risk. Therefore, even those systems determined
to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect
to financial statement preparation and presentation. Projections of
any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to
the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in
conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or
procedures may deteriorate. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There have been no changes in our internal controls over financial
reporting that occurred during the fourth quarter of the fiscal
year ended July 31, 2021, that have materially or are reasonably
likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial
reporting.

I TEM 13. CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND
RELATED TRANSACTIONS AND DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE 

Except as disclosed herein, no director, executive officer,
shareholder holding at least 5 of shares of our common stock, or
any family member thereof, had any material interest, direct or
indirect, in any transaction, or proposed transaction since the
year ended July 31, 2021, in which the amount involved in the
transaction exceeded or exceeds the lesser of 120,000 or one
percent of the average of our total assets at the year-end for the
last three completed fiscal years. 

For the years ended July 31, 2021 and 2020, total payments of 60,000 and 60,000,
respectively, were made to Noel Schaefer, a Director of the
Company, for consulting services. As of July 31,
2021 , and July 31, 2020 there is
 32,500 and 27,500 credited to accounts
payable. 

As of July 31, 2021 and July
31, 2020, there is 2,200 and 2,200, respectively, credited to
accounts payable for amounts due to Rachel Boulds, CFO, for
consulting services. 

13 

On September 25, 2018, the Company executed a loan agreement with
the wife of the CEO for 6,800. The loan was to be repaid by
December 15, 2018, with an additional 680 to cover interest and
fees. On October 10, 2018, the Company executed another loan
agreement for 15,000. The loan was to be repaid by December 15,
2018, with an additional 1,500 to cover interest and fees. As
of July 31, 2021 , the Company
owes 23,210 on this loan. This loan is in
default. 

Victor Miranda, a Director of the Company is also President and
owner of Labrador Capital SAPI DE CV Labrador ), a
major shareholder of the Company owning 8.8 of its issued and
outstanding shares. The Company has entered into a Memorandum of
Understanding with Labrador to jointly pursue developing real
estate projects in Mexico. As of the date of this report no
projects have been identified to jointly pursue. In the event
of a decision to go forward with Labrador, Victor Miranda will
abstain from voting to avoid any conflict of interest. 

During the year ended July 31, 2021, the Company sold 2,500,000
shares of common stock to Mr. Miranda at 0.02 per share for total
cash proceeds of 50,000. Mr. Miranda purchased an additional
600,000 shares of common stock at 0.03 per shares for
 18,000. 

Director Independence 

We
currently act with two directors, Noel Schaefer and Victor Miranda.
We have determined that we do not have an independent
director as defined in NASDAQ Marketplace Rule
4200(a)(15). 

We do not have a standing audit, compensation or nominating
committee, but our directors and officer act in such capacities. We
believe that our sole director is capable of analyzing and
evaluating our financial statements and understanding internal
controls and procedures for financial reporting. Our sole director
does not believe that it is necessary to have an audit committee
because we believe that the functions of an audit committee can be
adequately performed by the sole director. In addition, we believe
that retaining an independent director who would qualify as an
 audit committee financial expert would be overly
costly and burdensome and is not warranted in our circumstances
given the early stages of our development. 

I TEM 14. PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING FEES
AND SERVICES 

The aggregate fees billed for the most recently completed fiscal
year ended July 31, 2021 and for the fiscal year ended July 31,
2020 for professional services rendered by the principal accountant
for the audit of our annual financial statements and review of the
financial statements included in our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q
and services that are normally provided by the accountant in
connection with statutory and regulatory filings or engagements for
these fiscal periods were as follows: 

Year Ended 

July 31, 2021 

July 31, 2020 

Audit
Fees 

43,000 

25,000 

Audit
Related Fees 

- 

- 

Tax
Fees 

- 

- 

All
Other Fees 

- 

- 

Total 

43,000 

25,000 

Our board of directors pre-approves all services provided by our
independent auditors. All of the above services and fees were
reviewed and approved by the board of directors either before or
after the respective services were rendered. 

Our board of directors has considered the nature and amount of fees
billed by our independent auditors and believes that the provision
of services for activities unrelated to the audit is compatible
with maintaining our independent auditors 
independence.
