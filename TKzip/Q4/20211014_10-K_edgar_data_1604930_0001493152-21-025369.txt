Competition,
competitive position in the industry and methods of competition 

The
AI and mental health apps industry is highly competitive. The Company faces intense competition from very large, international corporations,
as well as from local and national companies. In addition, the Company faces competition from well-known companies that have large market
share. 

The
intensity of competition in the future is expected to increase and no assurance can be provided that the Company can sustain its market
position or expand its business. 

Many
of the Company s current and potential competitors are well established and have longer operating histories, significantly greater
financial and operational resources, and name recognition, which the Company does not have. 

Status
of any publicly announced new product or service 

The
Aiki mobile app product was launched on the Apple App Store the 1 st week of August 2021. The new AI-based intuitive mental
health ChatBot was announced in a press release on August 12 th . It was also available to Android users as of September. Aiki
is an interactive assistant that makes it easy to measure, understand, and improve the mental health of employees. The product aims to
capitalize on the trend towards artificial intelligence platforms utilized by employers to raise awareness of employees mental
health. 

Aiki
uses proprietary voice tone analysis and context analysis, which is processed by Cognitive Apps AI. It is a next generation ChatBot
for understanding and managing individual mental health that includes: 

Tracking
 of emotions and mood 

Analysis
 of mental state 

Treatment
 for improving mental well-being 

Aiki
will target corporate users who want to use Cognitive Apps voice biomarkers to target improved employee mental health. According to a
recent article on BenefitsPro.com i , research by Gallup shows mental health and emotional well-being have plunged to their
lowest levels since 2001. Another study charted a 50 rise in depression and a 60 drop in focus among all ages in the workplace at the
start of the year. Mental health at work was called one of the most far-reaching workplace issues of 2019 - well before COVID, which
creates a tremendous opportunity for Aiki.

Operating
expenses, which consisted of professional fees and general and administrative expenses, for the year ended June 30, 2021, were 599,590.
This compares with operating expenses for the year ended June 30, 2020, of 326,614. The increase of 272,976 in operating
expenses for the year ended June 30, 2021 is related to increases in contractual executive salaries and subsidiary payroll expenses. 

Other
Income/(Expense) increased to 2,929,447) for the year ended June 30, 2021 vs. 10,413,713) for the year ended June 30,
2020. The increase was directly related to the swings in derivative fair values from (10,018,665) in 2020 to 7,274,230 in 2021. Additionally,
there was a 10,036,200 loss on impairment of intangibles and a 468,505 gain on Batterfly settlement for the year ended

As
a result of the foregoing, we had a net loss of 3,479,037 for the year ended June 30, 2021. This compares with
a net loss for the year ended June 30, 2020 of 10,740,327. The difference is primarily due to a 2021 net gain in derivatives of 7,274,230,
compared to a net loss in derivatives of 10,018,665 for the year ended June 30, 2020. Additionally, there was a 10,036,200 loss on
impairment of intangibles for the year ended June 30, 2021. 

In
its audited consolidated financial statements as of June 30, 2021, the Company was issued an opinion by its auditors that raised substantial
doubt about the ability to continue as a going concern based on the Company s current financial position. Our ability to achieve
and maintain profitability and positive cash flow is dependent upon our ability to successfully develop and market our products and our
ability to generate revenues. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

As
of June 30, 2021, we had cash and cash equivalents of 230,685. As of June 30, 2020, we had cash and cash equivalents of 12,160. 

Net cash from operating activities was (175,088)
for the year ended June 30, 2021. This compares to net cash from operating activities of (21,614) for the year ended June 30, 2020.
The change of 153,474) in our net cash from operating activities for the year ended June 30, 2021 was primarily due to a change
in net income /(loss) of 7,261,290, plus a change in the fair value of the derivative of 7,274,230, offset by a loss on impairment
of intangibles of 10,036,200. 

Cash
flows from investing activities was 0 for the years ended June 30, 2021 and June 30, 2020. 

Cash
flows from financing activities was 400,000 for the year ended June 30, 2021, which compares to cash flows from financing activities
of 0 for the year ended June 30, 2020. The increase in our cash flows from financing activities for the year ended June 30, 2021 was
due to an increase in proceeds from convertible notes payable. 

We
have no present agreements or commitments with respect to any material acquisitions of other businesses, products, product rights or
technologies or any other material capital expenditures. However, we will continue to evaluate acquisitions of and/or investments in
products, technologies, capital equipment or improvements or companies that complement our business and may make such acquisitions and/or
investments in the future. Accordingly, we may need to obtain additional sources of capital in the future to finance any such acquisitions
and/or investments. We may not be able to obtain such financing on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. Due to the ongoing global
economic crisis, we believe it may be difficult to obtain additional financing if needed. Even if we are able to obtain additional financing,
it may contain undue restrictions on our operations, in the case of debt financing, or cause substantial dilution for our stockholders,
in the case of equity financing.

Going
Concern 

We
believe that the actions presently being taken to further implement the Company s business plan and generate revenues provide the
opportunity for us to continue as a going concern. While we believe in the viability of our strategy to generate revenues and in its
ability to raise additional funds, there can be no assurances to that effect. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent
upon our ability to further implement our business plan and generate revenues. 

The
consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if we are unable to continue as a going concern. 

Future
Financings 

We
will require additional financing to fund our planned operations. We currently do not have committed sources of additional financing
and may not be able to obtain additional financing particularly, if the volatile conditions of the stock and financial markets, and more
particularly the market for early development stage company stocks persist. There can be no assurance that additional financing will
be available to us when needed or, if available, that it can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. If we are not able to obtain
the additional financing on a timely basis, if and when it is needed, we will be forced to further delay or further scale down some or
all of our activities or perhaps even cease the operations of the business. 

Since
inception we have funded our operations primarily through equity and debt financings and we expect that we will continue to fund our
operations through equity and debt financing, either alone or through strategic alliances. If we are able to raise additional financing
by issuing equity securities, our existing stockholders ownership will be diluted. Obtaining commercial or other loans, assuming
those loans would be available, will increase our liabilities and future cash commitments. 

There
is no assurance that we will be able to maintain operations at a level sufficient for an investor to obtain a return on his, her, or
its investment in our common stock. Further, we may continue to be unprofitable. 

Critical
Accounting Policies 

The
SEC has defined a company s critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of our financial
condition and results of operations and which require us to make its most difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the
need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. Based on this definition, we have identified the critical accounting
policies and judgments addressed below. We also have other key accounting policies that are significant to understanding our results. 

The
following are deemed to be the most significant accounting policies affecting us. 

Use
of Estimates 

The
preparation of these consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures
of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of net sales and
expenses during the reported periods. Actual results may differ from those estimates and such differences may be material to the consolidated
financial statements. The more significant estimates and assumptions by management include among others: derivatives, estimated useful
lives of property and equipment, foreign currency transactions and translations, and common stock valuation. The current economic environment
has increased the degree of uncertainty inherent in these estimates and assumptions. 

Income
Taxes 

We
account for income taxes under an asset and liability approach. This process involves calculating the temporary and permanent differences
between the carrying amounts of the assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes.
The temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which would be recorded on our consolidated balance sheets in
accordance with ASC 740, which established financial accounting and reporting standards for the effect of income taxes. We must assess
the likelihood that its deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and, to the extent we believe that recovery
is not likely, we must establish a valuation allowance. Changes in our valuation allowance in a period are recorded through the income
tax provision on the consolidated statements of operations. 

- 12 - 

From
the date of our inception we adopted ASC 740-10-30. ASC 740-10 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in
an entity s consolidated financial statements and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attributes for consolidated
financial statement disclosure of tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return. Under ASC 740-10, the impact of an uncertain
income tax position on the income tax return must be recognized at the largest amount that is more-likely-than-not to be sustained upon
audit by the relevant taxing authority. An uncertain income tax position will not be recognized if it has less than a 50 likelihood
of being sustained. Additionally, ASC 740-10 provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in
interim periods, disclosure and transition. As a result of the implementation of ASC 740-10, we recognized no material adjustment in
the liability for unrecognized income tax benefits. 

Non-Cash
Equity Transactions 

Shares
of equity instruments issued for non-cash consideration are recorded at the fair value of the consideration received based on the market
value of services to be rendered, or at the value of the stock given, considered in reference to contemporaneous cash sale of stock. 

Fair
Value of Financial Instruments 

We
apply the provisions of accounting guidance, FASB Topic ASC 825, that requires all entities to disclose the fair value of financial instruments,
both assets and liabilities recognized and not recognized on the consolidated balance sheet, for which it is practicable to estimate
fair value, and defines fair value of a financial instrument as the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction
between willing parties. As of June 30, 2021 and 2020, the fair value of accounts payable approximated the carrying value due to the
short maturity of the instruments, quoted market prices or interest rates which fluctuate with market rates. 

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements 

There
were no Recently Adopted Standards. 

- 13 - 

In
June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial
Instruments. ASU 2016-13 amends the guidance on the impairment of financial instruments. This update adds an impairment model (known
as the current expected credit losses model) that is based on expected losses rather than incurred losses. Under the new guidance, an
entity recognizes, as an allowance, its estimate of expected credit losses. In November 2018, ASU 2016-13 was amended by ASU 2018-19,
 Codification Improvements to Topic 326, Financial Instruments Credit Losses. ASU 2018-19 changes the effective date of
the credit loss standards (ASU 2016-13) to fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, including interim periods within those fiscal
years. Further, the ASU clarifies that operating lease receivables are not within the scope of ASC 326-20 and should instead be accounted
for under the new leasing standard, ASC 842. The Company does not believe that the impact of this ASU will have a material impact on
its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 

In
January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment.
 The amendments in this ASU simplify the subsequent measurement of goodwill by eliminating Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test
and eliminating the requirement for a reporting unit with a zero or negative carrying amount to perform a qualitative assessment. Instead,
under this ASU, an entity would perform its annual, or interim, goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit
with its carrying amount and would recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit s
fair value; however, the loss recognized is not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. In addition,
income tax effects will be considered, if applicable. This ASU is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal
years, beginning after December 15, 2019. The Company adopted this ASU on July 1, 2020 and it had no material impact on its consolidated
financial statements and related disclosures. 

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements 

Under
SEC regulations, we are required to disclose our off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current
or future effect on our financial condition, such as changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity,
capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors. As of June 30, 2021, we have no off-balance sheet arrangements. 

Inflation 

We
do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our results of operations.

REPORT
OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

To
the Board of Directors and 

 Stockholders
of Life Clips, Inc. 

Opinion
on the Financial Statements 

We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Life Clips, Inc. (the Company) as of June 30, 2021 and 2020, and the related
consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss, changes in shareholders deficit, and cash flows for the years then
ended, and the related notes and schedules (collectively referred to as the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of June 30, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its
operations and its cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America. 

Basis
for Opinion 

These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s
financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities
laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company
is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits,
we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion
on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our
audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error
or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

Critical
Audit Matters 

The
critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated
or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial
statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters
does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit
matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. 

Derivatives 

As
described in Note 2 to the Company s consolidated financial statements, the Company evaluates all of its financial instruments
to determine if such instruments are derivative instruments or contain features that qualify as embedded derivatives. For derivative
financial instruments that are accounted for as liabilities, the derivative instrument is initially recorded at its fair value and then
re-valued at each reporting date, with changes in the fair value reported as charges or credits to income. 

We
identified the Company s application of the accounting for convertible notes as a critical audit matter. The principal considerations
for our determination of this critical audit matter related to the high degree of subjectivity in the Company s judgments in determining
the qualitative factors. Auditing these judgments and assumptions by the Company involves auditor judgment due to the nature and extent
of audit evidence and effort required to address these matters. 

F- 2 

The
primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matters included the following: 

We obtained debt related agreements and performed the following procedures: 

- 
 Reviewed
 agreements for all relevant terms. 

- 
 Tested
 management s identification and treatment of agreement terms. 

- 
 Recalculated
 management s fair value of each conversion feature based on the terms in the agreements. 

- 
 Assessed
 the terms and evaluated the appropriateness of management s application of their accounting policies, along with their use
 of estimates, in the determination of the amortization of the debt discount. 

- 
 Reviewed
 the work of the Company s specialist to calculate the fair value of the derivative liability using the Monte Carlo method to
 determine whether the derivative liability recorded by the Company was reasonable. 

Acquisition
of Subsidiary 

As
described in Note 4 to the Company s consolidated financial statements, the Company acquired Cognitive Apps Software Solutions,
Inc. during the year. The Company accounted for the acquisition in accordance with ASC 805, Business Combinations . 

We
identified the Company s accounting for the acquisition as a critical audit matter. The principal considerations for our determination
of this critical audit matter related to the high degree of subjectivity in the Company s judgments in determining the qualitative
factors. Auditing these judgments and assumptions by the Company involves auditor judgment due to the nature and extent of audit evidence
and effort required to address these matters. 

The
primary procedures we performed to address these critical audit matters included the following: 

We obtained the acquisition agreements and performed the following procedures: 

- 
 Reviewed
 agreements for all relevant terms, consideration and other relevant information. 

- 
 Tested
 supporting documentation related to the acquired company in determining the identifiable assets and liabilities. 

- 
 Reviewed
 the guidance related to ASC 805 to determine the acquisitions were appropriately accounted for by the Company. 

Substantial
Doubt about the Company s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern 

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note
3, the Company has incurred net accumulated losses and has minimal revenues. These factors, and the need for additional financing in
order for the Company to meet its business plans raises substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern.
Our opinion is not modified with respect to that matter.

NOTE
1. ORGANIZATION AND OPERATIONS 

Life

business was developing, financing, producing and distributing motion pictures and related entertainment products. Following the Company s
October 2, 2015 acquisition of Klear Kapture, Inc. Klear Kapture ), the Company continued Klear Kapture s business
of developing a body camera and an auditable software solution suitable for use by law enforcement. The Company changed its name to Life
Clips, Inc. on November 3, 2015 in order to better reflect its business operations at the time. 

On

solutions to the mental health and healthcare sector. 

Cognitive
Apps sold all of its issued and outstanding capital stock to LCLP, such that, becoming a 100 wholly-owned subsidiary of LCLP. 

NOTE
2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 

Basis
of Presentation and Consolidation The consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America GAAP ). The Company consolidates the financial
statements of its wholly-owned subsidiary and all intercompany transactions and account balances have been eliminated in consolidation. 

Use
of Estimates The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date
of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results
could differ from these estimates. 

Cash
and Cash Equivalents For financial statement presentation purposes, the Company considers all short-term investments with
a maturity date of three months or less to be cash equivalents. 

Investments The Company s
investments in marketable securities are measured at fair value with unrealized gains and losses recognized in other comprehensive income/(loss).
The Company received a total of 960,559 shares of Ehave, Inc. s common stock as payment for a licensing agreement. These shares
had a total value of 100,000 upon issuance. Subsequent to issuance, the stock price of the shares decreased and an unrealized loss on
the investment of 61,578 was recognized, decreasing the asset value to 38,422 at June 30, 2021. 

Income
Tax The Company accounts for income taxes under Accounting Standards Certifications ASC 740 Income
Taxes ASC 740 ). Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable
to differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective
tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years
in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Under ASC 740, the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities
of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period the enactment occurs. A valuation allowance is provided for certain deferred
tax assets if it is more likely than not that the Company will not realize tax assets through future operations. 

Basic
and Diluted Net Income (Loss) Per Share The Company computes net income (loss) per share in accordance with ASC 260 Earnings
Per Share ASC 260 ). ASC 260 requires presentation of both basic and diluted earnings per share EPS 
on the face of the consolidated statements of operations. Basic EPS is computed by dividing net income (loss) available to common shareholders
(numerator) by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. If applicable, diluted earnings per
share assume the conversion, exercise or issuance of all common stock instruments such as options, warrants and convertible securities,
unless the effect is to reduce a loss or increase earnings per share. Diluted EPS excludes all dilutive potential shares if their effect
is anti-dilutive. 

Fair
Value of Financial Instruments The Company measures assets and liabilities at fair value based on an expected exit price
as defined by the authoritative guidance on fair value measurements, which represents the amount that would be received on the sale of
an asset or paid to transfer a liability, as the case may be, in an orderly transaction between market participants. As such, fair value
may be based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. The authoritative guidance on fair value
measurements establishes a consistent framework for measuring fair value on either a recurring or nonrecurring basis whereby inputs,
used in valuation techniques, are assigned a hierarchical level. 

The
following are the hierarchical levels of inputs to measure fair value: 

Level
 1 Observable inputs that reflect quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. 

Level
 2 Inputs reflect quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; quoted prices for similar
 assets or liabilities in active markets; inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the assets or liabilities; or inputs
 that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means. 

Level
 3 Unobservable inputs reflecting the Company s assumptions incorporated in valuation techniques used to determine fair
 value. These assumptions are required to be consistent with market participant assumptions that are reasonably available. 

F- 8 

The
carrying amounts of the Company s financial assets and liabilities, such as cash, accounts payable, accrued expenses and interest,
certain notes payable and notes payable due to related parties, approximate their fair values because of the short maturity of
these instruments. 

The
Company accounts for its derivative liabilities, at fair value, on a recurring basis under Level 3 (See Note 7). The Company accounts
for its investments, at fair value, on a recurring basis under Level 1 (See Note 5) 

Embedded
Conversion Features The Company evaluates embedded conversion features within convertible debt under ASC 815 Derivatives
and Hedging to determine whether the embedded conversion feature(s) should be bifurcated from the host instrument and accounted
for as a derivative at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in earnings. If the conversion feature does not require derivative
treatment under ASC 815, the instrument is evaluated under ASC 470-20 Debt with Conversion and Other Options for
consideration of any beneficial conversion feature. 

Derivative
Financial Instruments The Company does not use derivative instruments to hedge exposures to cash flow, market, or foreign
currency risks. The Company evaluates all of its financial instruments, including stock purchase warrants, to determine if such instruments
are derivatives or contain features that qualify as embedded derivatives. For derivative financial instruments that are accounted for
as liabilities, the derivative instrument is initially recorded at its fair value and is then re-valued at each reporting date, with
changes in the fair value reported as charges or credits to income. 

For
option-based simple derivative financial instruments, the Company uses the Monte Carlo option-pricing model to value the derivative instruments
at inception and subsequent valuation dates. The classification of derivative instruments, including whether such instruments should
be recorded as liabilities or as equity, is re-assessed at the end of each reporting period. 

Debt
Issue Costs and Debt Discount The Company may record debt issue costs and/or debt discounts in connection with raising funds
through the issuance of debt. These costs may be paid in the form of cash, or equity (such as warrants). These costs are amortized to
interest expense over the life of the debt. If a conversion of the underlying debt occurs, a proportionate share of the unamortized amounts
is immediately expensed. 

Stock
Based Compensation ASC 718 Compensation-Stock Compensation prescribes accounting and reporting standards
for all stock-based compensation plan payments awarded to employees, including employee stock options, restricted stock, employee stock
purchase plans and stock appreciation rights, which may be classified as either equity or liabilities. The Company should determine if
a present obligation to settle the share-based payment transaction in cash or other assets exists. A present obligation to settle in
cash or other assets exists if: (a) the option to settle by issuing equity instruments lacks commercial substance or (b) the present
obligation is implied because of an entity s past practices or stated policies. If a present obligation exists, the transaction
should be recognized as a liability otherwise, the transaction should be recognized as equity. 

The
Company accounts for stock-based compensation issued to nonemployees and consultants in accordance with the provisions of ASC 505-50
 Equity-Based Payments to Non-Employees . Measurement of share-based payment transactions with nonemployees shall
be based on the fair value of whichever is more reliably measurable: (a) the goods or services received or (b) the equity instruments
issued. The fair value of the share-based payment transaction should be determined at the earlier of performance commitment date or performance
completion date. 

Recognition
of Licensing Revenues The Company recognizes licensing revenue in accordance with Accounting Standards Update ASU No. 2014-09 Revenue from Contracts with Customers . The Company recognizes
as revenues the amount of the transaction price that is allocated to the respective performance obligations when the performance obligation
is satisfied, or as it is satisfied. The Company primarily sells disposable and recyclable cell phone batteries. The Company s
performance obligation is satisfied when the goods have been delivered, which is at a point in time. The Company applies the following
five steps in order to determine the appropriate amount of revenue recognized as it fulfills its obligations under each of its agreements: 

identify
 the contract with a customer; 

identify
 the performance obligations in the contract; 

determine
 the transaction price; 

allocate
 the transaction price to performance obligations in the contract; and 

recognize
 revenue as the performance obligation is satisfied. 

Specifically
for licensing arrangements, the Company determines the nature of its Subsidiary s promise in granting a license is
either to provide a right to access intellectual property, which is satisfied over time and for which revenue is recognized over time,
or to provide a right to use our intellectual property, which is satisfied at a point in time and for which revenue is recognized at
a point in time. The scope and applicability of the guidance about when to recognize revenue for sales-based or usage-based royalties
promised in exchange for a license of intellectual property and whether restrictions of time, geographical region, or use on a license
of intellectual property do not affect the identification of performance obligations. 

Recently
Issued Accounting Pronouncements Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB ASU 2016-02 Leases (Topic 842) -
 In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, which will require lessees to recognize almost all leases on their consolidated balance
sheet as a right-of-use asset and a lease liability. For consolidated income statement purposes, the FASB retained a dual model, requiring
leases to be classified as either operating or finance. Classification will be based on criteria that are largely similar to those applied
in current lease accounting, but without explicit bright lines. Lessor accounting is similar to the current model, but updated to align
with certain changes to the lessee model and the new revenue recognition standard. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company adopted this in Fiscal Year 2020. 

Subsequent
Events The Company follows the guidance in ASC 855 Subsequent Events for the disclosure of subsequent
events. The Company will evaluate subsequent events through the date when the consolidated financial statements are issued. Pursuant
to ASU 2010-09 of the FASB ASC, the Company as an SEC filer considers its consolidated financial statements issued when they are widely
distributed to users, such as through filing them on EDGAR. 

F- 9 

NOTE
3. UNCERTAINTY OF ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN 

The
accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets
and the settlement of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. As reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial
statements, the Company has minimal revenues, net accumulated losses since inception and an accumulated deficit of 32,780,235.
These factors raise doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern
is dependent on management funding operating costs. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be
necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern. 

The
impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has had, and is expected to continue to have, an adverse effect on our business and our financial results.
The COVID-19 pandemic has negatively affected global economy, disrupted consumer spending and global supply chains and created significant
volatility and disruption of financial markets. The pandemic had and will continue to have an adverse effect on our business and financial
performance. The extent of the impact of the COVID-19, including our ability to execute our business strategies as planned, will depend
on future developments, including the duration and severity of the pandemic, which are uncertain and cannot be predicted. The COVID-19
pandemic could also adversely affect our liquidity and ability to access the capital markets. Uncertainty regarding the duration of the
COVID-19 pandemic may adversely impact our ability to raise additional capital, or require additional capital. 

NOTE
4. ACQUISITION OF SUBSIDIARY 

On
April 5, 2021, the Company closed its acquisition of Cognitive Apps Software Solutions, Inc. Cognitive Apps , Subsidiary ),
a developer of artificial intelligence (AI) applications for the healthcare industry and psychedelic research. Cognitive Apps was incorporated
in British Columbia on November 25, 2020. Its principal business is developing, financing, producing and distributing AI based technological
solutions to the mental health and healthcare sector. 

Cognitive
Apps sold all of its issued and outstanding capital stock to LCLP, such that, becoming a 100 wholly-owned subsidiary of LCLP. 

In
exchange for the acquisition, the subsidiary received the following consideration: 

(a)
 Preferred Shares. Exchange each issued and outstanding share of Cognitive Apps common stock for 5,760,000 shares of LCLP Series
B Preferred Shares. The Series B Preferred Shares are convertible based on 80 of average of the 5 lowest closing prices for a share
of Common Stock on the principal exchange or market on which such shares are then trading for the 20 trading days immediately preceding
such date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no case shall the fair market value multiplied by the total number of shares issued and
outstanding be less than 5,000,000. The fair value on the date of acquisition was calculated at 10,016,089. 

(b)
 Warrants. In addition to the Acquisition Preferred Shares, the Shareholders, on a pro-rata basis, will receive warrants to purchase
a total of 3,500,000 shares of the common shares of the Company at an exercise price of 0.10. The fair value of the warrants
on the date of acquisition was calculated at 20,111. 

(c)
 Financing. The Company shall use its best efforts after Closing to provide Cognitive Apps, as a wholly owned subsidiary, up to
 1,000,000 in the form of an equity investment by Corporation into the subsidiary. 

Cognitive
Apps had no operations and no significant assets recorded at the acquisition date. Based on the calculated purchase price of 10,036,200,
the entire amount was allocated to intangible assets. Due the lack of historical operations and uncertainty regarding future operations,
the Company impaired the full value of the intangible asset acquired. Also, as there were no previous operations, there are no pro forma
disclosures to present. 

NOTE
5. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS 

At
June 30, 2021 and 2020, due to related parties was 1,155,550 and 763,050, respectively. At June 30, 2021, this was comprised
of unpaid compensation of 776,050 to Victoria Rudman, 164,500 to William Singer, 90,000 to Charles Adelson, and 125,000 to
Robert Grinberg. 

As
of June 30, 2021, the board approved to pay these and any other amounts due by converting them to common stock. 

F- 10 

At June 30, 2021 and 2020, due from related party
was 34,271 and 0, respectively. This amount is due from a Subsidiary shareholder. 

NOTE
6. NOTES PAYABLE IN DEFAULT 

At
June 30, 2020, the Company had two notes payable in the amount of 530,000, with the following terms: 

1. 
 The
 Batterfly Acquisition Note required the Company to make two payments of 250,000 on October 6, 2017 and February 13, 2017. Upon failure
 to pay the payment due, the balance began to accrue at 11 interest per annum. 

2. 
 On
 July 14, 2016, the Company issued a new promissory note to NUWA Group, LLC NUWA ), from which the Company received
 30,000 in gross proceeds, has a maturity date of October 14, 2016, and bears interest at 5 per annum. This promissory note does
 not have a conversion feature. 

As
of June 30, 2021, all of the above Notes Payable were settled with shares of the Company s Common Stock. 

NOTE
7. CONVERTIBLE NOTES PAYABLE 

On
June 15, 2021, the Company entered into six Note Exchange Agreements to amend and restate 35 variable conversion notes, most of which
were in default, with interest rates ranging from 3.85 to 22 to a fixed conversion rate of 0.01 with an interest rate
of 8 . A total of 3,288,241 in principal and interest was converted from the variable to fixed conversion price, reducing the
need for derivative calculations to the 5 remaining notes that one holder declined to exchange. 

As
of June 30, 2021, the Company entered into two new notes payable with Leviston Resources LLC in the amount of 375,000, with the
following terms: 

1.

The
Company evaluated the convertible promissory notes under ASC 815 Derivatives and Hedging ASC 815 ). ASC 815 generally
requires the analysis of embedded terms and features that have characteristics of derivatives to be evaluated for bifurcation and separate
accounting in instances where their economic risks and characteristics are not clearly and closely related to the risks of the host contract.
The material embedded derivative consists of the embedded conversion feature. The conversion option bears risks of equity which were
not clearly and closely related to the host debt agreement and required bifurcation. 

Debt
Discount 

The
Company recorded the debt discount to the extent of the gross proceeds raised and expensed immediately the remaining fair value of the
derivative liability, as it exceeded the gross proceeds of the note. 

Total
amortization of debt discount amounted to 99,960 and 22,890 for the years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. 

As of June 30, 2021 and 2020, the debt discounts
were 80,369 and 0, respectively.

NOTE
8. DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 

The
Company s convertible promissory notes and detachable warrants gave rise to derivative financial instruments. The notes embodied
certain terms and conditions that were not clearly and closely related to the host debt agreement in terms of economic risks and characteristics.
These terms and features consist of the embedded conversion option. Additionally, the detachable warrants contained terms and features
that gave rise to derivative liability classification. As of June 30, 2021, the Company does not have enough authorized shares to settle
all potential conversion and warrant transactions. 

The
following tables summarize the components of the Company s derivative liabilities and linked common shares as of June 30, 2021
and 2020 and the amounts that were reflected in income related to derivatives for the period ended:

Current
accounting principles that are provided in ASC 815 - Derivatives and Hedging require derivative financial instruments to be classified
in liabilities and carried at fair value with changes recorded in income. The Company has selected the Binomial Lattice Model, which
approximates the Monte Carlo Simulations, valuation technique to fair value the compound embedded derivative because it believes that
this technique is reflective of all significant assumption types, and ranges of assumption inputs, that market participants would likely
consider in transactions involving compound embedded derivatives. Such assumptions include, among other inputs, interest risk assumptions,
credit risk assumptions and redemption behaviors in addition to traditional inputs for option models such as market trading volatility
and risk-free rates. The Binomial Lattice Model technique is a level three valuation technique because it requires the development of
significant internal assumptions in addition to observable market indicators. For instruments in which the time to expiration has expired,
the Company has utilized the intrinsic value as the fair value. The intrinsic value is the difference between the quoted market price
on the valuation date and the applicable conversion price.

Authorized
Capital 

On
September 28, 2017, the Company filed Articles of Amendment authorizing 5,000,000, shares of common stock, par value 0.001 per share
(the Common Stock and 20,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock, par value 0.001 (the Preferred Stock ). The
Board may issue shares of Preferred Stock in one or more series and fix the rights, preferences and privileges thereof, including voting
rights, terms of redemption, redemption prices, liquidation preferences, number of shares constituting any series or the designation
of such series, without further vote or action by the stockholders. 

F- 14 

Preferred
Stock 

Effective
May 19, 2017, the Company amended its Articles of Incorporation to designate 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock as Series A Preferred
Stock, with a par value of 0.001 per share (the Series A Stock ). Each share of Series A Stock ranks, with respect to dividend
rights and rights upon liquidation, winding up or dissolution of the Company, the same as the common stock of the Company, par value
 0.001 per share (the Common Stock and is not entitled to any specific dividends or other distributions, other than those
declared by the Board of Directors. Each share of Series A Stock has 400 votes on any matter submitted to the shareholders of the Company,
and the Series A Stock votes together with the holders of the outstanding shares of all other capital stock of the Company (including
the Common Stock and any other series of preferred stock then outstanding), and not as a separate class, series or voting group on any
such matter. The Series A Preferred Stock is not transferrable by the holder, and may be redeemed by the Company at any time for the
par value. In the event that the holder of Series A Preferred Stock who is an employee or officer of the Company leaves their position
as an employee or officer of the Company for any reason, the Series A Preferred Stock held by that holder will be automatically cancelled
and will revert to being authorized and unissued shares of Series A Preferred Stock. The Series A Stock is not convertible into any other
class of shares of the Company. 

On
June 16, 2021, the Board determined that it would be in the best interest of the Company to increase the Company s authorized Series
A Preferred stock to 5,000,000 (Five Million) shares. 

Additionally,
the Board authorized 5,760,000 (Five Million Seven Hundred and Sixty Thousand) shares of the Company s Series B preferred pursuant
to the acquisition of its Subsidiary. In exchange for the acquisition, the subsidiary received as consideration these Preferred Shares
in exchange for each issued and outstanding share of Cognitive Apps common stock at 1.00 per share. 

Each
share of Series B Preferred Stock shall be convertible, at the option of the holder thereof, beginning 12 months from the date of issuance,
and thereafter at any time and from time to time, and without the payment of additional consideration by the holder thereof, into that
number of fully paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock (whether whole or fractional) that have a Fair Market Value, in the aggregate,
equal to the Series B Conversion Price. The Series B Conversion Price shall initially be equal to 1.00. Such initial Series
B Conversion Price, and the rate at which shares of Series B Preferred Stock may be converted into shares of Common Stock, shall be subject
to adjustment as provided below. Fair Market Value shall mean as of any date of determination, the 80 of average of the
5 lowest closing prices for a share of Common Stock on the principal exchange or market on which such shares are then trading for the
20 trading days immediately preceding such date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no case shall the Fair Market Value multiplied by
the total number of shares issued and outstanding be less than 5,000,000. 

Stock
and Incentive Plan 

On
April 20, 2017, the Company adopted the Life Clips, Inc. 2017 Stock and Incentive Plan under which the Company may issue nonqualified
stock options, incentive stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock grants and units, performance units and awards of
cash. A maximum of 20,000,000 shares of common stock may be issued under the plan, representing in excess of 35 of the number of the
Company s currently outstanding shares. Awards under the plan will be made at the discretion of the Board of Directors, although
no awards have been made to date. Accordingly, the Company cannot currently determine the amount of awards that will be made under the
plan.

Company did not issue any warrants during the year ended June 30, 2020. 

On
April 5, 2021, as part of its acquisition of Cognitive Apps, the Company issued the shareholders of the subsidiary warrants to purchase
a total of 3,500,000 shares of the Company s common stock. 

Additionally,

NOTE
10. INCOME TAX PROVISION 

Income
taxes are provided for the tax effects of transactions reported in the consolidated financial statements and consist of taxes currently
due. Deferred taxes relate to differences between the basis of assets and liabilities for financial and income tax reporting which will
be either taxable or deductible when the assets or liabilities are recovered or settled. 

The
Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with the provisions of ASC 740, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes . The
Company accounts for income taxes using an asset and liability approach to calculate deferred income taxes. The asset and liability approach
requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between
the carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities. A valuation allowance is provided to offset any net deferred tax assets
for which management believes it is more likely than not that the net deferred asset will not be realized. 

F- 15 

At
June 30, 2021, the Company has a net operating loss carry-forward of (22,694,075) available to offset future taxable income
expiring through 2035. Utilization of future net operating losses may be limited due to potential ownership changes under Section
382 of the Internal Revenue Code. 

In
assessing the realization of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of
the deferred income tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred income tax assets is dependent upon the generation
of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled
reversal of deferred income tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and tax planning strategies in making this assessment.
Based on consideration of these items, management has determined that enough uncertainty exists relative to the realization of the deferred
income tax asset balances to warrant the application of a full valuation allowance as of June 30, 2021. 

The
effects of temporary differences that gave rise to significant portions of deferred tax assets at June 30, 2021 and 2020 are approximately
as follows: 

June 30, 2021 
 June 30, 2020

The
Company had no gross unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would favorably affect the effective income tax rate in future periods.
It has not accrued any interest or penalties associated with income taxes. The Company files income tax returns in the United States
federal jurisdiction. With few exceptions, it is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or non-U.S. income tax authorities on tax returns
filed before January 31, 2012. No tax returns are currently under examination by tax authorities. 

NOTE
11. COMMITTMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES 

From
time to time, the Company may be a party to other legal proceedings. Management currently believes that the ultimate resolution of these
matters will not have a material adverse effect on consolidated results of operations, financial position, or cash flow.

9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. 

Management s
annual report on internal control over financial reporting 

Our
management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, is responsible for establishing and maintaining
adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Our management, with the participation
of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our internal control over financial
reporting as of June 30, 2021. Our management s evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting was based on the framework
in Internal Control-Integrated Framework, issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this
evaluation, our management concluded that as of June 30, 2021, our internal control over financial reporting was not effective. 

The
ineffectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting was due to the following material weaknesses which we identified in
our internal control over financial reporting: (1) the lack of multiples levels of management review on complex accounting and financial
reporting issues, (2) a lack of adequate segregation of duties and necessary corporate accounting resources in our financial reporting
process and accounting function as a result of our limited financial resources to support hiring of personnel and implementation of accounting
systems. 

We
expect to be materially dependent upon third parties to provide us with accounting consulting services related to accounting services
for the foreseeable future. We believe this will be sufficient to remediate the material weaknesses related to our accounting discussed
above. Until such time as we have a chief financial officer with the requisite expertise in U.S. GAAP, there are no assurances that the
material weaknesses and significant deficiencies in our disclosure controls and procedures will not result in errors in our consolidated
financial statements which could lead to a restatement of those consolidated financial statements. 

A
material weakness is a deficiency or a combination of control deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting such that there
is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim consolidated financial statements will not be prevented
or detected on a timely basis. 

Limitations
on Effectiveness of Controls 

Our
principal executive officer and principal financial officer do not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial
reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable,
not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact
that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent
limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of
fraud, if any, within our company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making
can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Additional controls can be circumvented by the individual
acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls
also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will
succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes
in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a
cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.
