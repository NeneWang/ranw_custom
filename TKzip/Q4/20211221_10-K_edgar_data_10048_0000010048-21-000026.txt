ITEM 1. BUSINESS 
 
 Overview 
 
 Barnwell was incorporated in Delaware in 1956 and fiscal 2021 represented Barnwell s 65th year of operations. Barnwell operates in the following three principal business segments: 
 
 Oil and Natural Gas Segment - Barnwell engages in oil and natural gas development, production, acquisitions and sales in Canada and in the U.S. state of Oklahoma. 
 
 Land Investment Segment - Barnwell invests in land interests in Hawaii. 
 
 Contract Drilling Segment - Barnwell provides well drilling services and water pumping system installation and repairs in Hawaii. 
 
 Oil and Natural Gas Segment 
 
 Overview 
 
 Barnwell acquires and develops crude oil and natural gas assets in the province of Alberta, Canada via two corporate entities, Barnwell of Canada and Octavian Oil. Barnwell of Canada is a U.S. incorporated company that has been active in Canada for over 50 years, primarily as a non-operator participating in exploration projects operated by others. Octavian Oil is a Canadian company incorporated in 2016 to achieve growth through the acquisition of crude oil reserves and development of those reserves. Additionally, through its wholly-owned subsidiary BOK Drilling, LLC BOK ), established in February 2021, Barnwell is indirectly involved in oil and natural gas investments in Oklahoma. 
 
 Strategy 
 
 Barnwell s oil and natural gas assets are currently managed as two categories, Twining and non-operated, based on their differing attributes and strategies. 
 
 Twining consists of the Company-owned assets in the Twining field that were purchased in 2018. These assets are characterized by being mostly low decline oil wells that the Company operates that we believe have development opportunities. Due to the lower decline rates in the field, Twining requires a lower capital investment to maintain production levels. This lower capital requirement along with the fact that the land is largely held indefinitely, means development drilling can be done when higher commodity prices support it. Since Barnwell s entry into the Twining property in August 2018, the development methods in the area have evolved to include longer horizontal wells with multi-stage sand fracs. Barnwell invested approximately 2,400,000 and drilled its first well of this type in November 2019, and it is currently producing 90 Bbls of oil and 81 Boe of natural gas and NGL per day and has made cumulative production of 68,000 Boe since initial production. Barnwell continues to work to improve the operational efficiency of the Twining property and, if possible, to expand our land position and level of influence in the Twining area. 
 
 5 

The non-operated category consists of the Company's Canadian oil and natural gas assets not in the Twining area, as well as the new U.S. wells in Oklahoma. The Canadian non-operated assets are located throughout Alberta, Canada, and produce shallow gas and conventional oil from a variety of pools. These non-operated Canadian assets have been accumulated over decades of Barnwell activity. Barnwell continues to evaluate opportunities to either divest the legacy Canadian assets, or add to them depending on technical and economic evaluations. The majority of the Canadian assets have been up for sale on and off since January 2019, but COVID-19 and the resulting oil price collapse resulted in no reasonable offers being received. However, in April 2021, the Company re-initiated marketing for the sale of these assets and sold some properties. 
 
 In Oklahoma, the Company commenced participation in an eight-well drilling program with non-operated working interests for seven wells varying from 1.2 to 4.2 and a minor overriding royalty interest, 0.07 , in one well. Additional drilling opportunities in the U.S. are being investigated, however no definitive plans have yet been developed. 
 
 At September 30, 2021, Barnwell s Canadian reserves were approximately 64 operated and 56 conventional oil and natural gas liquids and 44 natural gas. Proved oil and natural gas reserves located in the United States were not significant at September 30, 2021, as most of the wells drilled were still undergoing evaluation. At September 30, 2020, Barnwell s reserves were approximately 48 operated and 57 conventional oil and natural gas liquids and 43 natural gas. 
 
 Operations 
 
 All acquisitions, operational and developmental activities in the Twining area are the responsibility of the President and Chief Operating Officer of Octavian Oil with approvals for major expenditures secured from Barnwell s executive management and the Board of Directors. 
 
 Our oil and natural gas segment revenues, profitability, and future rate of growth are dependent upon oil and natural gas prices and the Company s ability to use its current cash, obtain external financing or generate sufficient cash flows to fund the development of our reserves. The industry has experienced a period of low oil and natural gas prices that have negatively impacted our past operating results, cash flows and liquidity. Credit and capital markets for oil and natural gas companies have been negatively affected as well, resulting in a decline in sources of financing as compared to previous years. Oil and natural gas prices have recovered significantly from the prior year which could improve sources of external finances. 
 
 Natural gas prices are typically higher in the winter than at other times due to increased heating demand. Oil prices are also subject to seasonal fluctuations, but to a lesser degree. Oil and natural gas unit sales are based on the quantity produced from the properties by the properties operator. Prices received in Canada have also been negatively impacted by the lack of export pipeline capacity. 
 
 In August 2018, Barnwell completed the acquisition of interests in oil and natural gas properties located in the Twining area of Alberta, Canada, from an independent third party. The purchase price per the agreement was 10,362,000, which took into account estimated customary purchase price adjustments to reflect the economic activity from the effective date of July 1, 2018 to the closing date. The final determination of the customary adjustments to the purchase price resulted in a 172,000 reduction in the purchase price in the year ended September 30, 2019, bringing the final purchase price to 10,190,000. Barnwell also assumed 3,076,000 in asset retirement obligations associated with the Twining acquisition. This acquisition represented a significant step in Barnwell s long-term strategy to transform its Canadian 
 6 

operations to having almost exclusively conventional light and medium oil assets. This was a strategic purchase by the Company of what is now its largest oil and natural gas property. 
 
 At September 30, 2020, Barnwell reported no proved undeveloped reserves related to Twining as oil prices fell significantly in the second quarter of fiscal 2020 making the drilling of proved undeveloped reserves uneconomic and as a result, the Company suspended its development of proved undeveloped reserves in the Twining area. 
 
 The Company currently is planning to drill a new 100 working interest, operated horizontal well in the Twining area in the first half of fiscal 2022. Additionally, the Company is participating in the drilling of 2.0 gross (0.6 net) non-operated horizontal wells in the area over the same period. The results of these wells will help determine the quality and pace of future development. 
 
 As stated above, the Company commenced participation in an eight-well drilling program in Oklahoma with non-operated working interests in seven wells varying from 1.2 to 4.2 and a minor overriding royalty interest, 0.07 , in one well. One well began production in late May 2021 and the Company s share of net production, after royalties, from this well was 1,000 barrels of oil, 4,000 MCF of natural gas and 1,000 barrels of natural gas liquids through September 30, 2021. The remaining wells started production in September 2021. 
 
 Preparation of Reserve Estimates 
 
 Barnwell s Canadian reserves are estimated by our independent petroleum reserve engineers, InSite, in accordance with generally accepted petroleum engineering and evaluation principles and techniques and rules and regulations of the SEC. All information with respect to the Company s Canadian reserves in this Form 10-K is derived from the report of InSite. A copy of the report issued by InSite is filed with this Form 10-K as Exhibit 99.1. 
 
 The preparation of data used by the independent petroleum reserve engineers to compile our oil and natural gas reserve estimates was completed in accordance with various internal control procedures which include verification of data input into reserves evaluation software, reconciliations and reviews of data provided to the independent petroleum reserve engineers to ensure completeness, and management review controls, including an independent internal review of the final reserve report for completeness and accuracy. 
 
 Barnwell has a Reserves Committee consisting of three independent directors. The Reserves Committee was established to ensure the independence of the Company s petroleum reserve engineers. The Reserves Committee is responsible for reviewing the annual reserve evaluation report prepared by the independent petroleum reserve engineering firm and ensuring that the reserves are reported fairly in a manner consistent with applicable standards. The Reserves Committee meets annually to discuss reserve issues and policies and to meet with Company personnel and the independent petroleum reserve engineers. 
 
 Barnwell of Canada s President and Chief Operating Officer is a professional engineer with over 25 years of relevant experience in the oil and natural gas industry in Canada and is a member of the Association of Professional Engineers and Geoscientists of Alberta.

Reserves 
 
 The amounts set forth in the following table, based on InSite s evaluation of our reserves, summarize our estimated proved reserves of oil (including natural gas liquids) and natural gas as of September 30, 2021, for all properties located in Canada in which Barnwell has an interest. Proved oil and natural gas reserves located in the United States are not yet significant and are therefore not included in the table below. All of our oil and natural gas reserves are based on constant dollar price and cost assumptions. The Company emphasizes that reserve estimates are inherently imprecise and that estimates of new discoveries and undeveloped locations are more imprecise than estimates of established proved producing oil and natural gas properties. Accordingly, these estimates are expected to change as future information becomes available. Proved oil and natural gas reserves are the estimated quantities of oil and natural gas that geological and engineering data demonstrate, with reasonable certainty, to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under economic and operating conditions (i.e., prices and costs) existing at the time the estimate is made. Proved developed oil and natural gas reserves are proved reserves that can be expected to be recovered through existing wells and equipment in place and under operating methods being utilized at the time the estimates were made. No estimates of total proved net oil or natural gas reserves have been filed with, or included in reports to, any federal authority or agency, other than the SEC, since October 1, 2020. 
 As of September 30, 2021 Estimated Net Proved Developed Reserves Estimated Net Proved Undeveloped Reserves Estimated Net Proved Reserves Oil, including natural gas liquids (Bbls) 636,000 4,000 640,000 Natural gas (Mcf) 2,913,000 2,913,000 Total (Boe) 1,138,000 4,000 1,142,000 
 
 During fiscal 2021, Barnwell s total net proved developed reserves of oil and natural gas liquids increased by 106,000 Bbls (20 and total net proved developed reserves of natural gas increased by 603,000 Mcf (26 ), for a combined increase of 210,000 Boe (23 ). The increase in natural gas reserves were primarily the result of higher oil and gas prices resulting in positive revisions in the current year period. 
 
 The following table sets forth Barnwell s Canadian oil and natural gas net reserves at September 30, 2021, by property name, based on information prepared by InSite, as well as net production and net revenues by property name for the year ended September 30, 2021. The reserve data in this table is based on constant dollars where reserve estimates are based on sales prices, costs and statutory tax rates in existence at September 30, 2021, the date of the projection.

 Net proved reserves that are attributable to existing producing wells are primarily determined using decline curve analysis and rate transient analysis, which incorporates the principles of hydrocarbon flow. Net proved reserves attributable to producing wells with limited production history and for undeveloped locations are estimated using performance from analogous wells in the surrounding area and geologic data to assess the reservoir continuity. Technologies relied on to establish reasonable certainty of economic producibility include electrical logs, radioactivity logs, core analyses, geologic maps and available production data, seismic data and well test data.

Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows 
 
 The following table sets forth Barnwell s Estimated Future Net Revenues from total proved oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids reserves and the present value of Barnwell s Estimated Future Net Revenues (discounted at 10 as of September 30, 2021. Estimated future net revenues for total proved reserves are net of estimated future expenditures of developing and producing the proved reserves, and assume the continuation of existing economic conditions. Net revenues have been calculated using the average first-day-of-the-month price during the 12-month period ending as of the balance sheet date and current costs, after deducting all royalties, operating costs, future estimated capital expenditures (including abandonment costs), and income taxes. The amounts below include future cash flows from reserves that are currently proved undeveloped reserves and do not deduct general and administrative or interest expenses. Proved oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids reserves located in the United States are not significant and are therefore not included in the table below. 
 Year ending September 30, 2022 2,440,000 2023 1,795,000 2024 859,000 Thereafter (10,047,000) Undiscounted future net cash flows, after income taxes (4,953,000) Standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows 2,645,000 
 _______________________________________________ 
 This amount does not purport to represent, nor should it be interpreted as, the fair value of Barnwell s oil and natural gas reserves. An estimate of fair value would also consider, among other items, the value of Barnwell s undeveloped land position, the recovery of reserves not presently classified as proved, anticipated future changes in oil and natural gas prices (these amounts were based on a natural gas price of 2.23 per Mcf and an oil price of 49.73 per Bbl) and costs, and a discount factor more representative of the time value of money and the risks inherent in reserve estimates. 
 
 Barnwell has included all abandonment, decommissioning and reclamation costs and inactive well costs in accordance with best practice recommendations into the Company s reserve reports. 
 
 Oil and Natural Gas Production 
 
 The following table summarizes (a) Barnwell s net production for the last three fiscal years, based on sales of natural gas, oil and natural gas liquids, from all wells in which Barnwell has or had an interest, and (b) the average sales prices and average production costs for such production during the same periods. Production amounts reported are net of royalties. Barnwell s net production in fiscal 2021 was derived primarily in Alberta, Canada and to a lesser extent in Oklahoma. All of Barnwell's net production in fiscal 2020 and 2019 was derived in Alberta, Canada. For a discussion regarding our total annual production volumes, average sales prices, and related production costs, see Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

 Capital Expenditures and Acquisitions 
 
 Barnwell invested 2,217,000 in oil and natural gas properties during fiscal 2021, including accrued capital expenditures and acquisitions of oil and natural gas properties and excluding additions and revisions to estimated asset retirement obligations. Barnwell s capital expenditures were mostly for the acquisition of additional working interests in several wells and equipment in the Twining area and the drilling of wells in Oklahoma that began in the third quarter of fiscal 2021. 
 
 Barnwell invested 3,151,000 in oil and natural gas properties during fiscal 2020, including accrued capital expenditures and acquisitions of oil and natural gas properties and excluding additions and revisions to estimated asset retirement obligations. Barnwell s capital expenditures were mostly due to the Twining horizontal development well drilled in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 which amounted to approximately 2,400,000 and the participation in one gross (0.3 net) development well in the Spirit River area that was drilled in fiscal 2019 and completed in fiscal 2020 where approximately 670,000 in capital expenditures was incurred in fiscal 2020. There were no significant amounts paid for oil and natural gas property acquisitions during fiscal 2020. 
 
 Well Drilling Activities 
 
 The Company participated in the drilling of seven gross (0.20 net) non-operated wells in Oklahoma during the year ended September 30, 2021. Capital expenditures incurred by the Company for these Oklahoma wells totaled 1,178,000 for the year ended September 30, 2021. One gross (0.04 net) well was completed, the well began flowback production in late May 2021 and the Company s share of net production, after royalties, from this well was 1,000 barrels of oil, 4,000 MCF of natural gas and 1,000 barrels of natural gas liquids through September 30, 2021. The remaining six gross (0.16 net) wells were all producing in October 2021. 
 
 11 

The Company did not drill or participate in the drilling of wells in Canada during the year ended September 30, 2021. Drilling opportunities in the Company's core Twining area are being investigated for potential investment in the forthcoming months. 
 
 In fiscal 2020, Barnwell drilled one gross (1.0 net) horizontal development well in the Twining area. This well was successful and started producing in January 2020 and was temporarily shut-in from mid-April 2020 to mid-May 2020 due to decreased oil prices. This well contributed approximately 15,900 barrels of net oil production from January through September 2020, representing 10 total net oil production for fiscal 2020. In fiscal 2021, this well contributed approximately 34,200 barrels of net oil production, representing 23 total net oil production. 
 
 Producing Wells 
 
 As of September 30, 2021, Barnwell had interests in 139 gross (49.7 net) producing wells in Alberta, Canada, of which 82 gross (42.0 net) were oil wells and 57 gross (7.7 net) were natural gas wells. 
 
 As of September 30, 2021, Barnwell had interests in seven gross (0.20 net) producing oil wells in Oklahoma. 
 
 Developed Acreage and Undeveloped Acreage 
 
 The following table sets forth the gross and net acres of both developed and undeveloped oil and natural gas leases in Canada which Barnwell held as of September 30, 2021. Proved oil and natural gas reserves located in the United States are not significant and are therefore not included in the table below. 
 Developed Acreage Undeveloped Acreage Total Location Gross Net Gross Net Gross Net Canada 156,980 32,400 36,230 8,730 193,210 41,130 
 _________________________________________________ 
 Developed Acreage includes the acres covered by leases upon which there are one or more producing wells. Undeveloped Acreage includes acres covered by leases upon which there are no producing wells and which are maintained by the payment of delay rentals or the commencement of drilling thereon. 
 
 Eighty-five percent of Barnwell s undeveloped acreage is not subject to expiration at September 30, 2021. Fifteen percent of Barnwell s leasehold interests in undeveloped acreage is subject to expiration and expire over the next five fiscal years, if not developed, as follows: 6 expire during fiscal 2022; 7 expire during fiscal 2023; no expirations during fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2025; and 2 expire during fiscal 2026. There can be no assurance that Barnwell will be successful in renewing its leasehold interests in the event of expiration. 
 
 Much of the undeveloped acreage is at non-operated properties over which we do not have control, and the value of such acreage is not estimated to be significant at current commodity prices. Barnwell s undeveloped acreage includes a significant concentration in the Twining area (2,164 net acres). 
 
 Marketing of Oil and Natural Gas 
 
 Barnwell sells its oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids production, including under short-term contracts between itself and two main oil marketers, one natural gas purchaser, and one natural gas liquids marketer. The prices received are freely negotiated between buyers and sellers and are determined from transparent posted prices adjusted for quality and transportation differentials. In fiscal 2021, over 80 of 
 12 

Barnwell s oil and natural gas revenues were from products sold at spot prices. Barnwell does not use derivative instruments to manage price risk. 
 
 In fiscal 2021 and 2020, Barnwell took most of its oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas in kind where Barnwell markets the products instead of having the operator of a producing property market the products on Barnwell s behalf. We sell oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids to a variety of energy marketing companies. Because our products are commodities for which there are numerous marketers, we are not dependent upon one purchaser or a small group of purchasers. Accordingly, the loss of any single purchaser would not materially affect our revenues. 
 
 Governmental Regulation 
 
 The jurisdictions in which the oil and natural gas properties of Barnwell are located have regulatory provisions relating to permits for the drilling of wells, the spacing of wells, the prevention of oil and natural gas waste, allowable rates of production, environmental protection, and other matters. The amount of oil and natural gas produced is subject to control by regulatory agencies in each province. The province of Alberta and the Government of Canada also monitor the volume of natural gas that may be removed from the province and the conditions of removal; currently all our natural gas is sold within Alberta. 
 
 All of Barnwell s Canadian gross revenues were derived from properties located within Alberta, which charges oil and natural gas producers a royalty for production within the province. Provincial royalties are calculated as a percentage of revenue and vary depending on production volumes, selling prices and the date of discovery. Barnwell also pays gross overriding royalties and leasehold royalties on a portion of its oil and natural gas sales to parties other than the province of Alberta. 
 
 In January 2016, the Alberta Royalty Panel recommended a new modernized Alberta royalty framework which applies to wells drilled on or after January 1, 2017. The previous royalty framework will continue to apply to wells drilled prior to January 1, 2017 for a period of ten years, after which they will fall under the current royalty framework. Under the current royalty framework the same royalty calculation applies to both oil and natural gas wells, whereas the previous royalty framework had different royalties applicable to each category, and royalties are determined on a revenue minus cost basis where producers pay a flat royalty rate of 5 of gross revenues until a well reaches payout after which an increased post-payout royalty applies. Post payout royalties vary with commodity prices and are adjusted down for cost increases as wells age. 
 
 In fiscal 2021 and 2020, 45 and 44 , respectively, of royalties related to Alberta government charges, and 55 and 56 , respectively, of royalties related to freehold, override and other charges which are not directly affected by the Alberta royalty framework. 
 
 In fiscal 2021, the weighted-average royalty rate paid on all of Barnwell s natural gas was 8 , and the weighted-average royalty rate paid on oil was 12 . 
 
 Barnwell's oil and natural gas segment is currently subject to the provisions of the AER s LLR program. Under the LLR program the AER calculates a LMR for a company based on the ratio of the company s deemed assets over its deemed liabilities relating to wells and facilities for which the company is the licensed operator. The LMR assessment is designed to assess a company s ability to address its suspension, abandonment, remediation, and reclamation liabilities. The value of the deemed assets is based on each well's most recent twelve months of production and a rolling three-year average industry 
 13 

netback as determined by the AER annually. The AER has not recalculated the three-year average industry netback since March 2015 making the current value a premium to what most producers have been realizing. A recalculation of the value using current industry netback values would likely have a negative impact on our LMR. Companies with an LMR less than 1.0 are required to deposit funds with the AER to cover future deemed liabilities. At September 30, 2021, the Company had sufficient deemed asset value that no security deposit was due. The current liability framework is under revision by the AER. A percentage-based retirement framework is expected to be introduced, but further details are unknown at this time. 
 
 In September 2019, the AER issued an abandonment/closure order for all wells and facilities in the Manyberries area which had been largely operated by LGX, an operating company that went into receivership in 2016. The estimated asset retirement obligation for the Company's interest in the wells and facilities in the Manyberries area is included in Asset retirement obligation in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Many 100 LGX-owned wells are to be reclaimed by the OWA. However, as next largest interest holder in 82 wells and 7 facilities formerly operated by LGX, averaging 11 , the Company is required to take care and custody of those properties and to coordinate their closure. 
 
 In November 2019, in response to the AER order, the Company submitted its proposed plan to abandon the Manyberries wells and facilities in an orderly fashion over a ten-year period. This area has unique access issues as a result of an Emergency Protection Order to protect the Sage Grouse under the Canadian Government s Species at Risk Act. Access is limited to a window of mid-September to the end of November each year. The plan that the Company submitted began in October 2019 with field inspections, securing wells, and equipment inventory and the plan included further field activity beginning in the fall of 2020, our fiscal 2021 first quarter, which has been initiated and initially involves removal and salvage of the surface equipment; these costs are estimated to be minimal due in part to the salvage value of the equipment. Beyond fiscal 2021, the Company proposed and intends to perform seven to ten well abandonments per year over an estimated ten-year period as well as abandon the facilities in that time period. 
 
 Recently, the OWA created a WIP program for specific areas where there are a significant number of orphaned wells to abandon. The OWA has the ability and expertise to abandon wells using its internal resources and network of service providers resulting in efficiencies that companies such as Barnwell, would not be able to obtain on its own. Under the WIP program, the Company would be required to provide payment for only Barnwell s working interest share, however, all WIP s would have to participate in the program for the OWA to begin its work. In March 2021, the Company was notified by the OWA that Barnwell s Manyberries wells were confirmed to be in the WIP program. 
 
 Under the new agreement with the OWA, the Company is required to pay the abandonment and reclamation costs in advance through a cash deposit. The total cash deposit amount was calculated to be approximately 1,525,000 and the Company paid 888,000 of the total deposit in July and August 2021 and will need to pay the remaining balance of 637,000 by August 2022. The Company revised its Manyberries ARO liability based on the OWA s revised abandonment and reclamation estimates, which resulted in an increase of approximately 213,000 in the current year. The increase in the ARO liability was a result of higher reclamation and remediation costs than anticipated, partially offset by lower abandonment estimates. Based on a review of the details of the cash deposit calculation provided by the OWA, which includes amounts added for possible contingencies, the Company believes the required cash deposit amount by the OWA is higher than the actual costs of the asset retirement obligation for the Manyberries wells and that any excess of the deposit over actual asset retirement costs for the first phase 
 14 

of the work would be credited toward the second phase of the work. A remaining excess deposit, if any, would ultimately be refunded to the Company upon completion of all of the work. 
 
 Over the past five years, the Company has worked to reduce its abandonment and reclamation obligations associated with its oil and natural gas segment, both by divesting low-productivity assets and actively closing wells and sites. Sixteen Barnwell operated sites have been certified as fully reclaimed or exempt since 2016. To aid in this regard, and as a stimulus response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Canadian Federal Government created and funded the Alberta-administered Site Rehabilitation Program SRP in spring 2020. The SRP has been designed to reduce oil and gas industry liabilities by funding vendors who perform closure work. In partnership with its vendors, Barnwell-operated sites have received 303,000 in net funding to date, to be directed to ARO reduction activities. Barnwell has further benefited from grants allocated to its non-operated property partners amounting to 114,000. 
 
 The Company began participating in non-operated oil and natural gas investments in Oklahoma in fiscal 2021, however such operations were not significant as they were only in the initial stages of development and production. 
 
 Competition 
 
 Barnwell competes in the sale of oil and natural gas on the basis of price and on the ability to deliver products. The oil and natural gas industry is intensely competitive in all phases, including the acquisition and development of new production and reserves and the acquisition of equipment and labor necessary to conduct drilling activities. The competition comes from numerous major oil companies as well as numerous other independent operators. There is also competition between the oil and natural gas industry and other industries in supplying the energy and fuel requirements of industrial, commercial and individual consumers. Barnwell is a minor participant in the industry and competes in its oil and natural gas activities with many other companies having far greater financial, technical and other resources. 
 
 Land Investment Segment 
 
 Overview 
 
 Barnwell owns a 77.6 interest in Kaupulehu Developments, a Hawaii general partnership Kaupulehu Developments that has the right to receive payments from KD I and KD II resulting from the sale of lots and/or residential units by KD I and KD II within the approximately 870 acres of the Kaupulehu Lot 4A area in two increments Increment I and Increment II ), located approximately six miles north of the Kona International Airport in the North Kona District of the island of Hawaii. Kaupulehu Developments also holds an interest in approximately 1,000 acres of vacant leasehold land zoned conservation located adjacent to Lot 4A under a lease that terminates in December 2025, which currently has no development potential without both a development agreement with the lessor and zoning reclassification. 
 
 Barnwell, through two limited liability limited partnerships, KD Kona and KKM Makai KKM ), holds a non-controlling ownership interest in the Kukio Resort Land Development Partnerships comprised of KD Kukio Resorts, KD Maniniowali, and KDK. The Kukio Resort Land Development Partnerships own certain real estate and development rights interests in the Kukio, Maniniowali and Kaupulehu portions of Kukio Resort, a private residential community on the Kona coast of the island of Hawaii, as well as Kukio Resort s real estate sales office operations. KDK holds interests in KD I and KD II. KD I is the developer of Increment I, and KD II is the developer of Increment II. Barnwell's ownership interests in 
 15 

the Kukio Resort Land Development Partnerships are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. 
 
 Operations 
 
 In the 1980s, Kaupulehu Developments obtained the state and county zoning changes necessary to permit development of the Four Seasons Resort Hualalai at Historic Ka`upulehu and Hualalai Golf Club, which opened in 1996, a second golf course, and single-family and multi-family residential units. These projects were developed by an unaffiliated entity on leasehold land acquired from Kaupulehu Developments. 
 
 In the 1990s and 2000s, Kaupulehu Developments obtained the state and county zoning changes necessary to permit development of single-family and multi-family residential units, a golf course and a limited commercial area on approximately 870 leasehold acres, known as Lot 4A, zoned for resort/residential development, located adjacent to and north of the Four Seasons Resort Hualalai at Historic Ka`upulehu. In 2004 and 2006, Kaupulehu Developments sold its leasehold interest in Kaupulehu Lot 4A to KD I's and KD II's predecessors in interest, which was prior to Barnwell s affiliation with KD I and KD II which commenced on November 27, 2013, the acquisition date of our ownership interest in the Kukio Resort Land Development Partnerships. 
 
 Increment I is an area of 80 single-family lots, 71 of which were sold from 2006 to 2021 and of which nine lots remain to be sold, and a beach club on the portion of the property bordering the Pacific Ocean. The purchasers of the 80 single-family lots will have the right to apply for membership in the Kuki`o Golf and Beach Club, which is located adjacent to and south of the Four Seasons Resort Hualalai at Historic Ka`upulehu. Increment II is the remaining portion of the approximately 870-acre property and is zoned for single-family and multi-family residential units and a golf course and clubhouse. Two residential lots of approximately two to three acres in size fronting the ocean were developed within Increment II and sold by KD II, and the remaining acreage within Increment II is not yet under development. It is uncertain when or if KD II will develop the other areas of Increment II, and there is no assurance with regards to the amounts of future sales from Increments I and II. The remaining 420 developable acres at Increment II are entitled for up to 350 homesites. No definitive development plans have been made by the developer of Increment II as of the date of this report. 
 
 Kaupulehu Developments is entitled to receive payments from KD I based on the following percentages of the gross receipts from KD I s sales of single-family residential lots in Increment I: 10 of such aggregate gross proceeds greater than 100,000,000 up to 300,000,000; and 14 of such aggregate gross proceeds in excess of 300,000,000. In fiscal 2021, eight single-family lots in Increment I were sold bringing the total amount of gross proceeds from single-family lot sales through September 30, 2021 to 237,038,000. 
 
 In March 2019, KD II admitted a new development partner, Replay Kaupulehu Development, LLC Replay ), a party unrelated to Barnwell, in an effort to move forward with development of the remainder of Increment II at Kaupulehu. KDK and Replay hold ownership interests of 55 and 45 , respectively, of KD II and Barnwell has a 10.8 indirect non-controlling ownership interest in KD II through KDK, which is accounted for using the equity method of accounting. Barnwell continues to have an indirect 19.6 non-controlling ownership interest in KD Kukio Resorts, KD Maniniowali, and KD I. 
 
 Under the terms of the Increment II agreement with KD II, Kaupulehu Developments is entitled to 15 of the distributions of KD II, the cost of which is to be solely borne by KDK out of its 55 
 16 

ownership interest in KD II, plus a priority payout of 10 of KDK s cumulative net profits derived from Increment II sales subsequent to Phase 2A, up to a maximum of 3,000,000 as to the priority payout. Such interests are limited to distributions or net profits interests and Barnwell does not have any partnership interests in KD II or KDK through its interest in Kaupulehu Developments. The arrangement also gives Barnwell rights to three single-family residential lots in Phase 2A of Increment II, and four single-family residential lots in phases subsequent to Phase 2A when such lots are developed by KD II, all at no cost to Barnwell. Barnwell is committed to commence construction of improvements within 90 days of the transfer of the four lots in the phases subsequent to Phase 2A as a condition of the transfer of such lots. Also, in addition to Barnwell s existing obligations to pay professional fees to certain parties based on percentages of its gross receipts, Kaupulehu Developments is also obligated to pay an amount equal to 0.72 and 0.2 of the cumulative net profits of KD II to KD Development and a pool of various individuals, respectively, all of whom are partners of KKM and are unrelated to Barnwell, in compensation for the agreement of these parties to admit the new development partner for Increment II. Such compensation will be reflected as the obligation becomes probable and the amount of the obligation can be reasonably estimated. 
 
 In fiscal 2021, the Kukio Resort Land Development Partnerships sold eight lots in Increment I and as a result of the lot sales, made cash distributions to its partners of which Barnwell received 6,011,000, after distributing 683,000 to minority interests. Of the 6,011,000 net cash distribution received from the Kukio Resort Land Development Partnerships, 459,000 represented a payment of the preferred return from KKM and was recorded as an additional equity pickup in the Equity in income of affiliates line item on the accompanying Consolidated Statement of Operations during the year ended September 30, 2021. See Note 4 for further discussion on the preferred return from KKM. 
 
 Competition 
 
 Barnwell s land investment segment is subject to intense competition in all phases of its operations including the acquisition of new properties, the securing of approvals necessary for land rezoning, and the search for potential buyers of property interests presently owned. The competition comes from numerous independent land development companies and other industries involved in land investment activities. The principal factors affecting competition are the location of the project and pricing. Barnwell is a minor participant in the land development industry and competes in its land investment activities with many other entities having far greater financial and other resources. 
 
 Contract Drilling Segment 
 
 Overview 
 
 Barnwell s wholly-owned subsidiary, Water Resources, drills water and water monitoring wells of varying depths in Hawaii, installs and repairs water pumping systems, and is the distributor for Trillium Flow Technologies, previously known as Floway, pumps and equipment in the state of Hawaii. 
 
 Operations 
 
 Water Resources owns and operates five water well drilling rigs, two pump rigs and other ancillary drilling and pump equipment. Additionally, Water Resources temporarily rents a storage facility in Honolulu, Hawaii, and leases a one acre maintenance and storage facility with 2,800 square feet of interior space in Kawaihae, Hawaii, and a one-half acre equipment storage yard in Waimea, Hawaii. Water 
 17 

Resources also maintains an inventory of uninstalled materials for jobs in progress and an inventory of drilling materials and pump supplies. 
 
 Water Resources currently operates in Hawaii and is not subject to seasonal fluctuations. The demand for Water Resources services is primarily dependent upon land development activities in Hawaii. Water Resources markets its services to land developers and government agencies, and identifies potential contracts through public notices, its officers involvement in the community and referrals. Contracts are usually fixed price per lineal foot drilled and are negotiated with private entities or obtained through competitive bidding with private entities or local, state and federal agencies. Contract revenues are not dependent upon the discovery of water or other similar targets, and contracts are not subject to renegotiation of profits or termination at the election of the governmental entities involved. Contracts provide for arbitration in the event of disputes. 
 
 In fiscal 2021, Water Resources started one well drilling and five pump installation and repair contracts and completed six pump and repair contracts. No well drilling contracts were completed in fiscal 2021. Of the six completed pump and repair contracts, one was started in fiscal 2019, two were started in fiscal 2020 and three were started in the current year. Fifty-six percent of well drilling and pump installation and repair jobs, representing 48 of total contract drilling revenues in fiscal 2021, have been pursuant to government contracts. 
 
 At September 30, 2021, there was a backlog of six well drilling and ten pump installation and repair contracts, of which five well drilling and nine pump installation and repair contracts were in progress as of September 30, 2021. 
 
 The approximate dollar amount of Water Resources backlog of firm well drilling and pump installation and repair contracts at December 1, 2021 and 2020 was as follows: 
 December 1, 2021 2020 Well drilling 8,000,000 4,700,000 Pump installation and repair 1,500,000 2,500,000 9,500,000 7,200,000 
 
 Of the contracts in backlog at December 1, 2021, 5,900,000 is expected to be recognized in fiscal 2022, 2,436,000 pertains to a government contract that expires in 2022 and may not be extended, with the remainder to be recognized in the following fiscal year. 
 
 Competition 
 
 Water Resources competes with other drilling contractors in Hawaii, some of which use drill rigs similar to Water Resources . These competitors are also capable of installing and repairing vertical turbine and submersible water pumping systems in Hawaii. These contractors compete actively with Water Resources for government and private contracts. Pricing is Water Resources major method of competition; reliability of service is also a significant factor. 
 
 Competitive pressures are expected to remain high, thus there is no assurance that the quantity or values of available or awarded jobs which occurred in fiscal 2021 will continue.

Financial Information About Industry Segments and Geographic Areas 
 
 Note 12 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 contains information on our segments and geographic areas. 
 
 Employees 
 
 At December 1, 2021, Barnwell employed 36 individuals; 35 on a full time basis and 1 on a part time basis. 
 
 Environmental Costs 
 Barnwell is subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations. U.S. Federal and state and Canadian Federal and provincial governmental agencies issue rules and regulations and enforce laws to protect the environment which are often difficult and costly to comply with and which carry substantial penalties for failure to comply, particularly in regard to the discharge of materials into the environment. These laws, which are constantly changing, regulate the discharge of materials into the environment and maintenance of surface conditions and may require Barnwell to remove or mitigate the environmental effects of the disposal or release of petroleum or chemical substances at various sites where it has a working interest. 
 
 For further information on environmental remediation, see the Contingencies section included in Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 
 
 The business of Barnwell and its subsidiaries face numerous risks, including those set forth below or those described elsewhere in this Form 10-K or in Barnwell s other filings with the SEC. The risks described below are not the only risks that Barnwell faces. If any of the following risk factors should occur, our profitability, financial condition or liquidity could be materially negatively impacted. 
 
 Entity-Wide Risks 
 
 Our business operations and financial condition have been and may continue to be materially and adversely affected by the outbreak of a novel strain of coronavirus, which resulted in the global health pandemic referred to as COVID-19. 
 
 In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak a global pandemic and the United States and Canadian governments declared the virus a national emergency shortly thereafter. The ongoing global health crisis (including resurgences) resulting from the pandemic have, and continue to, disrupt the normal operations of many businesses, including the temporary closure or scale-back of business operations and/or the imposition of either quarantine or remote work or meeting requirements for employees, either by government order or on a voluntary basis. While the outbreak recently appeared to be trending downward, particularly as vaccination rates increased, new variants of COVID-19 continue emerging, including the highly transmissible Delta variant and the newly-discovered Omicron variant (currently a variant of concern ), spreading throughout the U.S. and globally and causing significant uncertainty. The global economy, our markets and our business have been, and may continue to be, materially and adversely affected by COVID-19. 
 
 The COVID-19 outbreak materially and adversely affected our business operations and financial condition as a result of the deteriorating market outlook, the global economic recession and weakened liquidity. Although demand for oil and oil prices has recovered from the lows of March through May of the prior year, uncertainty regarding future oil prices has impacted and continues to impact the Company s financial condition and outlook. While the Company s contract drilling segment remained operational throughout fiscal 2020 and 2021 and continues to work, the continuing potential impact of COVID-19 on the health of our contract drilling segment's crews and ability or desire for customers to continue such work is uncertain, and any discontinuation of contracts currently in backlog would result in a material adverse impact to the Company s financial condition and outlook. Though availability of vaccines and reopening of state and local economies has improved the outlook for recovery from COVID-19's impacts, the impact of the Delta or Omicron variant or other new, more contagious or lethal variants that may emerge, the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines against the Delta or Omicron variant or such other variants and the related responses by governments, including reinstated government-imposed lockdowns or other measures, cannot be predicted at this time. Both the health and economic aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic remain highly fluid and the future course of each is uncertain. We cannot foresee whether the outbreak of COVID-19 will be effectively contained on a sustained basis, nor can we predict the severity and duration of its impact. If the outbreak of COVID-19 is not effectively and timely controlled on a sustained basis going forward, our business operations and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected by factors that we cannot foresee. Any of these factors and other factors beyond our control could have an adverse effect on the overall business environment, cause uncertainties in the regions where we conduct business, cause our business to suffer in ways that we cannot predict and materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.

We are subject to the Continued Listing Criteria of the NYSE American and our failure to maintain continued compliance with the listing requirements of the NYSE American exchange could result in the delisting of our common stock. 
 
 Our common stock is listed on the NYSE American. In order to maintain this listing, we must maintain certain share prices, financial and share distribution targets, including maintaining a minimum amount of stockholders equity and a minimum number of public stockholders. In addition to these objective standards, the NYSE American may delist the securities of any issuer if, in its opinion, the issuer s financial condition and/or operating results appear unsatisfactory; if it appears that the extent of public distribution or the aggregate market value of the security has become so reduced as to make continued listing on the NYSE American inadvisable; if the issuer sells or disposes of principal operating assets or ceases to be an operating company; if an issuer fails to comply with the NYSE American s listing requirements; if an issuer s common stock sells at what the NYSE American considers a low selling price (generally trading below 0.20 per share for an extended period of time); or if any other event occurs or any condition exists which makes continued listing on the NYSE American, in its opinion, inadvisable. 
 
 On January 13, 2020, the Company received notice from the NYSE American that the Company was not in compliance with Section 1003(a)(i) and Section 1003(a)(ii) of the NYSE American Company Guide (the Guide ), which respectively require an issuer to have (i) stockholders equity of 2.0 million or more if such issuer reported losses from continuing operations and/or net losses in two of its three most recent fiscal years and (ii) stockholders equity of 4.0 million or more if such issuer reported losses from continuing operations and/or net losses in three of its four most recent fiscal years, since we reported stockholders equity of 1.2 million as of September 30, 2019 and net losses in three of the last four most recent fiscal years then ended, and that the Company s common stock could be at risk of being delisted. 
 
 In accordance with the NYSE American s policies and procedures, we subsequently submitted a plan (the Plan to the NYSE American detailing the steps we planned to take to raise our stockholders equity above 4.0 million and regain compliance with Section 1003(a)(i) and Section 1003(a)(ii) of the Guide. On April 2, 2020, the NYSE American notified the Company that it accepted the Plan and granted the Company an extension for its continued listing until July 13, 2021. 
 
 On July 13, 2021, the Company filed a Form 8-K report with the Securities and Exchange Commission announcing that the Company s pro forma stockholders equity (unaudited) as of July 13, 2021 was projected to be above the 4.0 million required to comply with Section 1003(a)(i) and Section 1003(a)(ii) of the Guide. Accordingly, in a letter dated July 14, 2021, the NYSE American determined the Company had resolved the continued listing deficiency with respect to Section 1003(a)(i) and Section 1003(a)(ii) of the Guide and notified the Company that it had successfully regained compliance with the NYSE American continued listing standards. 
 
 Accordingly, the Company continues to be subject to the normal continued listing criteria of the NYSE American. However, if the company, within 12 months of July 14, 2021, is again determined to be below any of the continued listing standards, the NYSE American staff will examine the relationship between the two incidents of falling below continued listing standards and re-evaluate the Company's method of financial recovery from the first incident. It will then take appropriate action, which, depending upon the circumstances, may include truncating the procedures described above or immediately initiating delisting proceedings. If the NYSE American delists our common stock, investors may face material adverse consequences, including, but not limited to, a lack of a trading market for our common stock, reduced liquidity, and an inability for us to obtain financing to fund our operations. 
 21 

Stockholders may be diluted significantly through our efforts to obtain financing and satisfy obligations through the issuance of securities. 
 
 Our Board of Directors has authority, without action or vote of the stockholders, subject to the requirements of the NYSE American (which generally require stockholder approval for any transactions which would result in the issuance of more than 20 of our then outstanding shares of common stock or voting rights representing over 20 of our then outstanding shares of stock, subject to certain exceptions, including sales in public offerings and/or sales which are undertaken at or above the greater of the book value and/or market value of the issuer s common stock on the date the transaction is agreed to be completed), to issue all or part of the authorized but unissued shares of common stock or warrants to purchase such shares of common stock. In addition, we may attempt to raise capital by selling shares of our common stock, possibly at a discount to market in the future. These actions would result in dilution of the ownership interests of existing stockholders and may further dilute common stock book value, and that dilution may be material. A related effect of such issuances may enhance existing large stockholders influence on the Company, including that of Alexander Kinzler, our Chief Executive Officer. 
 
 A small number of stockholders, including our CEO, own a significant amount of our common stock and have influence over our business regardless of the opposition of other stockholders. 
 
 As of September 30, 2021, the CEO, who is a member of the Board of Directors, and two other stockholders hold approximately 39 of our outstanding common stock. The interests of one or more of these stockholders may not always coincide with the interests of other stockholders. These stockholders have significant influence over all matters submitted to our stockholders, including the election of our directors, and could accelerate, delay, deter or prevent a change of control of the Company. The significant stockholders who are also members of the Board of Directors could significantly affect our business, policies and affairs. 
 
 Our operations are subject to currency rate fluctuations. 
 
 Our operations are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the Canadian dollar. Our financial statements, presented in U.S. dollars, may be affected by foreign currency fluctuations through both translation risk and transaction risk. Volatility in exchange rates may adversely affect our results of operations, particularly through the weakening of the U.S. dollar relative to the Canadian dollar which may affect the relative prices at which we sell our oil and natural gas and may affect the cost of certain items required in our operations. To date, we have not entered into foreign currency hedging transactions to control or minimize these risks. 
 
 Adverse changes in actuarial assumptions used to calculate retirement plan costs due to economic or other factors, or lower returns on plan assets could adversely affect Barnwell s results and financial condition. 
 
 Retirement plan cash funding obligations and plan expenses and obligations are subject to a high degree of uncertainty and could increase in future years depending on numerous factors, including the performance of the financial markets, specifically the equity markets, levels of interest rates, and the cost of health care insurance premiums. 
 22 

The price of our common stock has been volatile and could continue to fluctuate substantially. 
 
 The market price of our common stock has been volatile and could fluctuate based on a variety of factors, including: 
 
 fluctuations in commodity prices; 
 variations in results of operations; 
 announcements by us and our competitors; 
 legislative or regulatory changes; 
 general trends in the industry; 
 general market conditions; 
 litigation; and 
 other events applicable to our industries. 
 
 Failure to retain key personnel could hurt our operations. 
 
 We require highly skilled and experienced personnel to operate our business. In addition to competing in highly competitive industries, we compete in a highly competitive labor market. Our business could be adversely affected by an inability to retain personnel or upward pressure on wages as a result of the highly competitive labor market. Further, there are significant personal liability risks to Barnwell of Canada's individual officers and directors related to well clean-up costs that may affect our ability to attract or retain the necessary people. 
 
 We are a smaller reporting company and benefit from certain reduced governance and disclosure requirements, including that our independent registered public accounting firm is not required to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. We cannot be certain if the omission of reduced disclosure requirements applicable to smaller reporting companies will make our common stock less attractive to investors. 
 
 Currently, we are a smaller reporting company, meaning that our outstanding common stock held by nonaffiliates had a value of less than 250 million at the end of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter. As a smaller reporting company, we are not required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, meaning our auditors are not required to attest to the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. As a result, investors and others may be less comfortable with the effectiveness of the Company s internal controls and the risk that material weaknesses or other deficiencies in internal controls go undetected may increase. In addition, as a smaller reporting company, we take advantage of our ability to provide certain other less comprehensive disclosures in our SEC filings, including, among other things, providing only two years of audited financial statements in annual reports and simplified executive compensation disclosures. Consequently, it may be more challenging for investors to analyze our results of operations and financial prospects, as the information we provide to stockholders may be different from what one might receive from other public companies in which one hold shares. As a smaller reporting company, we are not required to provide this information.

Risks Related to Oil and Natural Gas Segment 
 
 Acquisitions or discoveries of additional reserves are needed to increase our oil and natural gas segment operating results and cash flow. 
 
 In August 2018, Barnwell made a significant reinvestment into its oil and natural gas segment with the acquisition of the Twining property in Alberta, Canada. The Company believes there are potential undeveloped reserves for which significant future capital expenditures will be needed to convert those potential undeveloped reserves into developed reserves. If future circumstances are such that we are not able to make the capital expenditures necessary to convert potential undeveloped reserves to developed reserves, we will not replace the amount of reserves produced and sold and our reserves and oil and natural gas segment operating results and cash flows will decline accordingly, and we may be forced to sell some of our oil and natural gas segment assets under untimely or unfavorable terms. Any such curtailment or sale could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 Future oil and natural gas operating results and cash flow are highly dependent upon our level of success in acquiring or finding additional reserves on an economic basis. We cannot guarantee that we will be successful in developing or acquiring additional reserves and our current financial resources may be insufficient to make such investments. Furthermore, if oil or natural gas prices increase, our cost for additional reserves could also increase. 
 
 We may not realize an adequate return on oil and natural gas investments. 
 
 Drilling for oil and natural gas involves numerous risks, including the risk that we will not encounter commercially productive oil or natural gas reservoirs. The wells we drill or participate in may not be productive, and we may not recover all or any portion of our investment in those wells. If future oil and natural gas segment acquisition and development activities are not successful it could have an adverse effect on our future results of operations and financial condition. 
 
 Oil and natural gas prices are highly volatile and further declines, or extended low prices will significantly affect our financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 Much of our revenues and cash flow are greatly dependent upon prevailing prices for oil and natural gas. Lower oil and natural gas prices not only decrease our revenues on a per unit basis, but also reduce the amount of oil and natural gas we can produce economically, if any. Prices that do not produce sufficient operating margins will have a material adverse effect on our operations, financial condition, operating cash flows, borrowing ability, reserves, and the amount of capital that we are able to allocate for the acquisition and development of oil and natural gas reserves. 
 
 Various factors beyond our control affect prices of oil and natural gas including, but not limited to, changes in supply and demand, market uncertainty, weather, worldwide political instability, foreign supply of oil and natural gas, the level of consumer product demand, government regulations and taxes, the price and availability of alternative fuels and the overall economic environment. Energy prices are also subject to other political and regulatory actions outside our control, which may include changes in the policies of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries or other developments involving or affecting oil-producing countries, or actions or reactions of the government of the United States in anticipation of or in response to such developments. 
 24 

The inability of one or more of our working interest partners to meet their obligations may adversely affect our financial results. 
 
 For our operated properties, we pay expenses and bill our non-operating partners for their respective shares of costs. Some of our non-operating partners may experience liquidity problems and may not be able to meet their financial obligations. Nonperformance by a non-operating partner could result in significant financial losses. 
 
 Liquidity problems encountered by our working interest partners or the third party operators of our non-operated properties may also result in significant financial losses as the other working interest partners or third party operators may be unwilling or unable to pay their share of the costs of projects as they become due. In the event a third party operator of a non-operated property becomes insolvent, it may result in increased operating expenses and cash required for abandonment liabilities if the Company is required to take over operatorship. Barnwell holds an 11 working interest, the largest working interest other than that held by the operator, in a property with approximately 82 wells and 7 facilities where the operator is in receivership. 
 
 We may incur material costs to comply with or as a result of health, safety, and environmental laws and regulations. 
 
 The oil and natural gas industry is subject to extensive environmental regulation pursuant to local, provincial and federal legislation. A violation of that legislation may result in the imposition of fines or the issuance of clean up orders. Legislation regulating the oil and natural gas industry may be changed to impose higher standards and potentially more costly obligations. Although we have recorded a provision in our financial statements relating to our estimated future environmental and reclamation obligations that we believe is reasonable, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to satisfy our actual future environmental and reclamation obligations. 
 
 Barnwell's oil and natural gas segment is subject to the provisions of the AER s LLR program. Under the LLR program the AER calculates a LMR for a company based on the ratio of the company s deemed assets over its deemed liabilities relating to wells and facilities for which the company is the licensed operator and imposes a security deposit on operators whose estimated liabilities exceed their deemed asset value. At September 30, 2021, the Company had sufficient deemed asset value that no security deposit was due. However, decreases in prices and production and related netbacks from relevant properties could result in a decline in the Company's deemed asset value to a point where a deposit could be due in the future. The current liability framework is under revision by the AER. A percentage-based retirement framework is expected to be introduced, but further details are unknown at this time. 
 
 The AER requires purchasers of AER licensed oil and natural gas assets to have an LMR of 2.0 or higher immediately following the transfer of a license. This LMR requirement for well transfers hinders our ability to generate capital by selling oil and natural gas assets as there are less qualified buyers. 
 
 A requirement to provide security deposit funds to the AER in the future would result in the diversion of cash on hand and operating cash flows that could otherwise be used to fund oil and natural gas reserve replacement efforts, which could in turn have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. If Barnwell fails to comply with the requirements of the LLR program, Barnwell's oil and natural gas subsidiary would be subject to the AER's enforcement provisions which could include suspension of operations and non-compliance fees and could ultimately result in the 
 25 

AER serving the Company with a closure order to shut-in all operated wells. Additionally, if Barnwell is non-compliant, the Company would be prohibited from transferring well licenses which would prohibit us from selling any oil and natural gas assets until the required cash deposit is made with the AER. 
 
 We are not fully insured against certain environmental risks, either because such insurance is not available or because of high premium costs. In particular, insurance against risks from environmental pollution occurring over time, as opposed to sudden and catastrophic damages, is not available on economically reasonable terms. Accordingly, any site reclamation or abandonment costs actually incurred in the ordinary course of business in a specific period could negatively impact our cash flow. Should we be unable to fully fund the cost of remedying an environmental problem, we might be required to suspend operations or enter into interim compliance measures pending completion of the required remedy. 
 
 We may fail to fully identify potential problems related to acquired reserves or to properly estimate those reserves. 
 
 We periodically evaluate acquisitions of reserves, properties, prospects and leaseholds and other strategic transactions that appear to fit within our overall business strategy. Our evaluation includes an assessment of reserves, future oil and natural gas prices, operating costs, potential for future drilling and production, validity of the seller s title to the properties and potential environmental issues, litigation and other liabilities. 
 
 In connection with these assessments, we perform a review of the subject properties that we believe to be generally consistent with industry practices. Our review will not reveal all existing or potential problems nor will it permit us to become sufficiently familiar with the properties to fully assess their deficiencies and potential recoverable reserves. Inspections may not always be performed on every well, and environmental problems are not necessarily observable even when an inspection is undertaken. Even when problems are identified, the seller may be unwilling or unable to provide effective contractual protection against all or part of the problems. We often are not entitled to contractual indemnification for environmental liabilities or title defects in excess of the amounts claimed by us before closing and acquire properties on an as is basis. 
 
 There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved oil and gas reserves and future production rates and costs with respect to acquired properties, and actual results may vary substantially from those assumed in the estimates. 
 
 If oil and natural gas prices decline, we may be required to take write-downs of the carrying values of our oil and natural gas properties. 
 
 Oil and natural gas prices affect the value of our oil and natural gas properties as determined in our full cost ceiling calculation. Any future ceiling test write-downs will result in reductions of the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties and an equivalent charge to earnings. 
 
 26 

The oil and natural gas industry is highly competitive. 
 
 We compete for capital, acquisitions of reserves, undeveloped lands, skilled personnel, access to drilling rigs, service rigs and other equipment, access to processing facilities, pipeline capacity and in many other respects with a substantial number of other organizations, most of which have greater technical and financial resources than we do. Some of these organizations explore for, develop and produce oil and natural gas, carry on refining operations and market oil and other products on a worldwide basis. As a result of these complementary activities, some of our competitors may have competitive resources that are greater and more diverse than ours. Furthermore, many of our competitors may have a competitive advantage when responding to factors that affect demand for oil and natural gas production, such as changing prices and production levels, the cost and availability of alternative fuels and the application of government regulations. If our competitors are able to capitalize on these competitive resources, it could adversely affect our revenues and profitability. 
 
 An increase in operating costs greater than anticipated could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. 
 Higher operating costs for our properties will directly decrease the amount of cash flow received by us. Electricity, supplies, and labor costs are a few of the operating costs that are susceptible to material fluctuation. The need for significant repairs and maintenance of infrastructure may increase as our properties age. A significant increase in operating costs could negatively impact operating results and cash flow. 
 
 Our operating results are affected by our ability to market the oil and natural gas that we produce. 
 
 Our business depends in part upon the availability, proximity and capacity of oil and natural gas gathering systems, pipelines and processing facilities. Canadian federal and provincial, as well as United States federal and state, regulation of oil and natural gas production, processing and transportation, tax and energy policies, general economic conditions, and changes in supply and demand could adversely affect our ability to produce and market oil and natural gas. If market factors change and inhibit the marketing of our production, overall production or realized prices may decline. 
 
 We are not the operator and have limited influence over the operations of certain of our oil and natural gas properties. 
 
 We hold minority interests in certain of our oil and natural gas properties. As a result, we cannot control the pace of exploration or development, major decisions affecting the drilling of wells, the plan for development and production at non-operated properties, or the timing and amount of costs related to abandonment and reclamation activities although contract provisions give Barnwell certain consent rights in some matters. The operator s influence over these matters can affect the pace at which we incur capital expenditures. Additionally, as certain underlying joint venture data is not accessible to us, we depend on the operators at non-operated properties to provide us with reliable accounting information. We also depend on operators and joint operators to maintain the financial resources to fund their share of all abandonment and reclamation costs. 
 
 27 

Actual reserves will vary from reserve estimates. 
 
 Estimating reserves is inherently uncertain and the reserves estimation process involves significant decisions and assumptions in the evaluation of available geological, geophysical, engineering and economic data. The reserve data and standardized measures set forth herein are only estimates. Ultimately, actual reserves attributable to our properties will vary from estimates, and those variations may be material. The estimation of reserves involves a number of factors and assumptions, including, among others: 
 
 oil and natural gas prices as prescribed by SEC regulations; 
 historical production from our wells compared with production rates from similar producing wells in the area; 
 future commodity prices, production and development costs, royalties and capital expenditures; 
 initial production rates; 
 production decline rates; 
 ultimate recovery of reserves; 
 success of future development activities; 
 marketability of production; 
 effects of government regulation; and 
 other government levies that may be imposed over the producing life of reserves. 
 
 If these factors, assumptions and prices prove to be inaccurate, actual results may vary materially from reserve estimates. 
 
 SEC rules could limit our ability to book additional proved undeveloped reserves PUDs in the future. 
 
 SEC rules require that, subject to limited exceptions, PUDs may only be booked if they relate to wells scheduled to be drilled within five years after the date of booking. This requirement may limit our ability to book PUDs as we pursue our drilling program. 
 
 Part of our strategy involves using some of the latest available horizontal drilling and completion techniques. The results of our drilling are subject to drilling and completion technique risks, and results may not meet our expectations for reserves or production. 
 
 Many of our operations involve, and are planned to utilize, the latest drilling and completion techniques as developed by our service providers in order to maximize production and ultimate recoveries and therefore generate the highest possible returns. Risks we face while completing our wells include, but are not limited to, the inability to fracture stimulate the planned number of stages, the inability to run tools and other equipment the entire length of the well bore during completion operations, the inability to recover such tools and other equipment, and the inability to successfully clean out the well bore after completion of the final fracture stimulation. Ultimately, the success of these drilling and completion techniques can only be evaluated over time as more wells are drilled and production profiles are established over a sufficiently long time period. If our drilling results are less than anticipated or we are unable to execute our drilling program because of capital constraints, lease expirations, limited access to gathering systems and takeaway capacity, and/or prices for crude oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids decline, then the return on our investment for a particular project may not be as attractive as we anticipated and we could incur material write-downs of oil and gas properties and the value of our undeveloped acreage could decline in the future. 
 28 

Production and reserves, if any, attributable to the use of enhanced recovery methods are inherently difficult to predict. If our enhanced recovery methods do not allow for the extraction of crude oil, natural gas, and associated liquids in a manner or to the extent that we anticipate, we may not realize an acceptable return on our investments in such projects. 
 
 Delays in business operations could adversely affect the amount and timing of our cash inflows. 
 
 In addition to the usual delays in payment by purchasers of oil and natural gas to the operators of our properties, and the delays of those operators in remitting payment to us, payments between any of these parties may also be delayed by: 
 
 restrictions imposed by lenders; 
 accounting delays; 
 delays in the sale or delivery of products; 
 delays in the connection of wells to a gathering system; 
 blowouts or other accidents; 
 adjustments for prior periods; 
 recovery by the operator of expenses incurred in the operation of the properties; and 
 the establishment by the operator of reserves for these expenses. 
 
 Any of these delays could expose us to additional third party credit risks. 
 
 The oil and natural gas market in which we operate exposes us to potential liabilities that may not be covered by insurance. 
 Our operations are subject to all of the risks associated with the operation and development of oil and natural gas properties, including the drilling of oil and natural gas wells, and the production and transportation of oil and natural gas. These risks include encountering unexpected formations or pressures, premature declines of reservoirs, blow-outs, equipment failures and other accidents, cratering, sour gas releases, uncontrollable flows of oil, natural gas or well fluids, adverse weather conditions, pollution, other environmental risks, fires and spills. A number of these risks could result in personal injury, loss of life, or environmental and other damage to our property or the property of others. 
 
 While we carry various levels of insurance, we could be affected by civil, criminal, regulatory or administrative actions, claims or proceedings. We cannot fully protect against all of the risks listed above, nor are all of these risks insurable. There is no assurance that any applicable insurance or indemnification agreements will adequately protect us against liability for the risks listed above. We could face substantial losses if an event occurs for which we are not fully insured or are not indemnified against or a customer or insurer fails to meet its indemnification or insurance obligations. In addition, there can be no assurance that insurance will continue to be available to cover any or all of these risks, or, even if available, that insurance premiums or other costs will not rise significantly in the future, so as to make the cost of such insurance prohibitive. 
 
 Deficiencies in operating practices and record keeping, if any, may increase our risks and liabilities relating to incidents such as spills and releases and may increase the level of regulatory enforcement actions. 
 
 29 

Our operations are subject to domestic and foreign government regulation and other risks, particularly in Canada and the United States. 
 
 Barnwell s oil and natural gas operations are affected by political developments and laws and regulations, particularly in Canada and the United States, such as restrictions on production, restrictions on imports and exports, the maintenance of specified reserves, tax increases and retroactive tax claims, expropriation of property, cancellation of contract rights, environmental protection controls, environmental compliance requirements and laws pertaining to workers health and safety. Further, the right to explore for and develop oil and natural gas on lands in Alberta, Saskatchewan and British Columbia is controlled by the governments of each of those provinces. Changes in royalties and other terms of provincial leases, permits and reservations may have a substantial effect on Barnwell s operations. We derive a significant portion of our revenues from our operations in Canada; 57 in fiscal 2021. 
 
 Additionally, our ability to compete in the Canadian oil and natural gas industry may be adversely affected by governmental regulations or other policies that favor the awarding of contracts to contractors in which Canadian nationals have substantial ownership interests. Furthermore, we may face governmentally imposed restrictions or fees from time to time on the transfer of funds to the U.S. 
 
 Government regulations control and often limit access to potential markets and impose extensive requirements concerning employee safety, environmental protection, pollution control and remediation of environmental contamination. Environmental regulations, in particular, prohibit access to some markets and make others less economical, increase equipment and personnel costs and often impose liability without regard to negligence or fault. In addition, governmental regulations may discourage our customers activities, reducing demand for our products and services. 
 
 Compliance with foreign tax and other laws may adversely affect our operations. 
 Tax and other laws and regulations are not always interpreted consistently among local, regional and national authorities. Income tax laws, other legislation or government incentive programs relating to the oil and natural gas industry may in the future be changed or interpreted in a manner that adversely affects us and our stockholders. It is also possible that in the future we will be subject to disputes concerning taxation and other matters in Canada, including the manner in which we calculate our income for tax purposes, and these disputes could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance. 
 
 Unforeseen title defects may result in a loss of entitlement to production and reserves. 
 
 Although we conduct title reviews in accordance with industry practice prior to any purchase of resource assets or property, such reviews do not guarantee that an unforeseen defect in the chain of title will not arise and defeat our title to the purchased assets. If such a defect were to occur, our entitlement to the production from such purchased assets could be jeopardized. 
 
 30 

Risks Related to Land Investment Segment 
 
 Receipt of future payments from KD I and KD II and cash distributions from the Kukio Resort Land Development Partnerships is dependent upon the developer s continued efforts and ability to develop and market the property. 
 
 We are entitled to receive future payments based on a percentage of the sales prices of residential lots sold within the Kaupulehu area by KD I and KD II as well as a percentage of future distributions KD II makes to its members. However, in order to collect such payments we are reliant upon the developer, KD I and KD II, in which we own a non-controlling ownership interest, to continue to market the remaining lots within Increment I and to proceed with the development or sale of the remaining portion of Increment II. Additionally, future cash distributions from the Kukio Resort Land Development Partnerships, which includes KD I and KD II, are also dependent on future lot sales in Increment I by KD I and the development or sale of Increment II by KD II. It is uncertain when or if KD II will develop or sell the remaining portion of Increment II, and there is no assurance with regards to the amounts of future sales from Increments I and II. We do not have a controlling interest in the partnerships, and therefore are dependent on the general partner for development decisions. The receipt of future payments and cash distributions could be jeopardized if the developer fails to proceed with development and marketing of the property. 
 
 We hold investment interests in unconsolidated land development partnerships, which are accounted for using the equity method of accounting, in which we do not have a controlling interest. These investments involve risks and are highly illiquid. 
 
 These investments involve risks which include: 
 
 the lack of a controlling interest in these partnerships and, therefore, the inability to require that the entities sell assets, return invested capital or take any other action without obtaining the majority vote of partners; 
 potential for future additional capital contributions to fund operations and development activities; 
 the adverse impact on overall profitability if the entities do not achieve the financial results projected; 
 the reallocation of amounts of capital from other operating initiatives and/or an increase in indebtedness to pay potential future additional capital contributions, which could in turn restrict our ability to access additional capital when needed or to pursue other important elements of our business strategy; 
 undisclosed, contingent or other liabilities or problems, unanticipated costs, and an inability to recover or manage such liabilities and costs and which could delay or prevent development of the real estate held by the land development partnerships; and 
 certain underlying partnership data is not accessible to us, therefore we depend on the general partner to provide us with reliable accounting information. 
 
 31 

We may be required to write-down the carrying value of our investment in the Kukio Resort Land Development Partnerships if our assumptions about future lot sales and profitability prove incorrect. Any write-down would negatively impact our results of operations. 
 
 In analyzing the value of our investment in the Kukio Resort Land Development Partnerships, we have made assumptions about the level of future lot sales, operating and development costs, cash generation and market conditions. These assumptions are based on management s and the general partner s best estimates and if the actual results differ significantly from these assumptions, we may not be able to realize the value of the assets recorded, which could lead to an impairment of certain of these assets in the future. Such a write-down would have a negative impact on our results of operations. 
 
 Our land investment business is concentrated in the state of Hawaii. As a result, our financial results are dependent on the economic growth and health of Hawaii, particularly the island of Hawaii. 
 
 Barnwell s land investment segment is impacted by the condition of Hawaii s real estate market, which is affected by Hawaii s economy and Hawaii s tourism industry, as well as the United States and world economies in general. Any future cash flows from Barnwell s land development activities are subject to, among other factors, the level of real estate activity and prices, the demand for new housing and second homes on the island of Hawaii, the rate of increase in the cost of building materials and labor, the introduction of building code modifications, changes to zoning laws, and the level of confidence in Hawaii s economy. 
 
 The occurrence of natural disasters in Hawaii could adversely affect our business. 
 The occurrence of a natural disaster in Hawaii such as, but not limited to, earthquakes, landslides, hurricanes, tornadoes, tsunamis, volcanic activity, droughts and floods, could have a material adverse effect on our land investments. The occurrence of a natural disaster could also cause property and flood insurance rates and deductibles to increase, which could reduce demand for real estate in Hawaii. 
 
 Risks Related to Contract Drilling Segment 
 
 Demand for water well drilling and/or pump installation is volatile. A decrease in demand for our services could adversely affect our revenues and results of operations. 
 
 Demand for services is highly dependent upon land development activities in the state of Hawaii. As also noted above, the real estate development industry is cyclical in nature and is particularly vulnerable to shifts in local, regional, and national economic conditions outside of our control such as interest rates, housing demand, population growth, employment levels and job growth and property taxes. A decrease in water well drilling and/or pump installation contracts will result in decreased revenues and operating results. 
 
 If we are unable to accurately estimate the overall risks, requirements or costs when bidding on or negotiating a contract that is ultimately awarded, we may achieve a lower than anticipated profit or incur a loss on the contract. 
 
 Contracts are usually fixed price per lineal foot drilled and require the provision of line-item materials at a fixed unit price based on approved quantities irrespective of actual per unit costs. Under such contracts, prices are established in part on cost and scheduling estimates, which are based on a number of assumptions, many of which are beyond our control. Expected profits on contracts are realized 
 32 

only if costs are accurately estimated and successfully controlled. We may not be able to obtain compensation for additional work performed or expenses incurred as a result of changes or inaccuracies in these estimates and underlying assumptions, such as unanticipated sub-surface site conditions, unanticipated technical problems, equipment failures, inefficiencies, cost of raw materials, schedule delays due to constraints on drilling hours, weather delays, or accidents. If cost estimates for a contract are inaccurate, or if the contract is not performed within cost estimates, then cost overruns may result in losses or cause the contract not to be as profitable as expected. 
 
 A significant portion of our contract drilling business is dependent on municipalities and a decline in municipal spending could adversely impact our business. 
 
 A significant portion of our contract drilling division revenues is derived from water and infrastructure contracts with governmental entities or agencies; 48 in fiscal 2021. Reduced tax revenues and governmental budgets may limit spending by local governments which in turn will affect the demand for our services. Material reductions in spending by a significant number of local governmental agencies could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, liquidity and financial position. 
 
 Our contract drilling operations face significant competition. 
 
 We face competition for our services from a variety of competitors. Many of our competitors utilize drilling rigs that drill as quickly as our equipment but require less labor. Our strategy is to compete based on pricing and to a lesser degree, quality of service. If we are unable to compete effectively with our competitors, our financial results could be adversely affected. 
 
 The loss of or damage to key vendor, customer or sub-contractor relationships would adversely affect our operations. 
 
 Our contract drilling business is dependent on our relationships with key vendors, customers and subcontractors. The loss of or damage to any of our key relationships could negatively affect our business. 
 
 Awarding of contracts is dependent upon our ability to obtain contract bid and performance bonds from insurers. 
 
 There can be no assurance that our ability to obtain such bonds will continue on the same basis as the past. Additionally, bonding insurance rates may increase and have an impact on our ability to win competitive bids, which could have a corresponding material impact on contract drilling operating results. 
 
 The contracts in our backlog are subject to change orders and cancellation. 
 
 Our backlog consists of the uncompleted portion of services to be performed under contracts that have been started and new contracts not yet started. Our contracts are subject to change orders and cancellations, and such changes could adversely affect our operations. 
 
 The occurrence of natural disasters in Hawaii could adversely affect our business. 
 
 The occurrence of a natural disaster in Hawaii such as, but not limited to, earthquakes, landslides, hurricanes, tornadoes, tsunamis, volcanic activity, droughts and floods, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to complete our contracts.

This discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report. 
 
 Current Outlook 
 
 Impact of COVID-19 
 
 In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak a global pandemic and the United States and Canadian governments declared the virus a national emergency shortly thereafter. The ongoing global health crisis (including resurgences) resulting from the pandemic have, and continue to, disrupt the normal operations of many businesses, including the temporary closure or scale-back of business operations and/or the imposition of either quarantine or remote work or meeting requirements for employees, either by government order or on a voluntary basis. While the outbreak recently appeared to be trending downward, particularly as vaccination rates increased, new variants of COVID-19 continue emerging, including the highly transmissible Delta variant and the newly-discovered Omicron variant (currently a variant of concern ), spreading throughout the U.S. and globally and causing significant uncertainty. The global economy, our markets and our business have been, and may continue to be, materially and adversely affected by COVID-19. 
 The COVID-19 outbreak materially and adversely affected our business operations and financial condition as a result of the deteriorating market outlook, the global economic recession and weakened liquidity. Although demand for oil and oil prices has recovered from the lows of March through May of the prior year, uncertainty regarding future oil prices has impacted and continues to impact the Company s financial condition and outlook. While the Company s contract drilling segment remained operational throughout fiscal 2020 and 2021 and continues to work, the continuing potential impact of COVID-19 on the health of our contract drilling segment's crews and ability or desire for customers to continue such work is uncertain, and any discontinuation of contracts currently in backlog would result in a material adverse impact to the Company s financial condition and outlook. Though availability of vaccines and reopening of state and local economies has improved the outlook for recovery from COVID-19's impacts, the impact of the Delta or Omicron variant or other new, more contagious or lethal variants that may emerge, the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines against the Delta or Omicron variant or such other variants and the related responses by governments, including reinstated government-imposed lockdowns or other measures, cannot be predicted at this time. Both the health and economic aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic remain highly fluid and the future course of each is uncertain. We cannot foresee whether the outbreak of COVID-19 will be effectively contained on a sustained basis, nor can we predict the severity and duration of its impact. If the outbreak of COVID-19 is not effectively and timely controlled on a sustained basis going forward, our business operations and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected by factors that we cannot foresee. Any of these factors and other factors beyond our control could have an adverse effect on the overall business environment, cause uncertainties in the regions where we conduct business, cause our business to suffer in ways that we cannot predict and materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 36 

Going Concern 
 
 Our ability to sustain our business in the future will depend on the sufficiency of our cash on hand, oil and natural gas operating cash flows, which are highly sensitive to volatile oil and natural gas prices, contract drilling operating cash flows, which are subject to large changes in demand, and future land investment segment proceeds and distributions from the Kukio Resort Land Development Partnerships, the timing of which are both highly uncertain and not within Barnwell s control. A sufficient level of such cash and cash inflows are necessary to fund discretionary oil and natural gas capital expenditures, which must be economically successful to provide sufficient returns, as well as fund our non-discretionary outflows such as oil and natural gas asset retirement obligations and ongoing operating and general and administrative expenses. In addition, as discussed in the "Asset Retirement Obligation" section of "Liquidity and Capital Resources," a significant amount of funds will be required to be put on deposit with Canadian regulatory authorities to fund abandonments at the Company's oil and natural gas properties in the Manyberries area. Other sources and potential sources of funding are discussed below. 
 
 In fiscal 2020, the Company listed its corporate office on the 29th floor of a commercial office building in downtown Honolulu, Hawaii for sale and on September 30, 2021, the Company s Honolulu corporate office was sold for approximately 1,864,000, net of related costs. 
 
 On March 16, 2021, the Company initiated an at-the-market offering program ATM pursuant to which the Company may offer and sell, from time to time, shares of its common stock under price and volume guidelines set by the Company's Board of Directors and the terms and conditions described in the Registration Statement. The sale of shares under the ATM began in May 2021 and as of September 30, 2021, the Company sold 1,167,987 shares of common stock resulting in net proceeds of 3,784,000 after commissions and fees of 123,000. 
 
 In April 2021, the Company re-initiated the marketing of its non-core oil and natural gas properties in the Spirit River, Wood River, Medicine River, Kaybob, Bonanza, Balsam and Thornbury areas for sale. On July 8 2021, Barnwell entered into and completed a purchase and sale agreement with an independent third party and sold its interests in certain natural gas and oil properties located in the Spirit River area of Alberta, Canada. The sales price per the agreement was adjusted for customary purchase price adjustments to 1,047,000 in order to, among other things, reflect an economic effective closing date of sale of July 8, 2021. From Barnwell's net proceeds, 526,000 was withheld for remittance by the buyers to the Canada Revenue Agency for potential amounts due for Barnwell s Canadian income taxes related to the sale. Negotiations regarding the potential sales of other non-core oil and natural gas properties is ongoing, however there is no assurance that the sale of any of the other non-core properties will occur. 
 
 We have experienced a trend of losses and negative operating cash flows in three of the last four years. During fiscal 2020 and 2021, continuing uncertainties regarding the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business and the sufficiency of our cash balances and future cash inflows as described above raised substantial doubt about our ability to meet our estimated cash outflows or continue as a going concern. However, due to the 3,784,000 of net proceeds raised by the ATM through September 30, 2021, the proceeds received from the sale of the Company's corporate office and its interests in certain natural gas and oil properties in the Spirit River area, as well as the 7,156,000 of net cash inflows in the year ended September 30, 2021 from land segment percentage of sales proceeds and distributions from the Kukio Resort Land Development Partnerships, substantial doubt about our ability to meet our estimated cash outflows or continue as a going concern for one year from the date of the filing of this report has been overcome.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 
 The Company considers an accounting estimate to be critical if the accounting estimate requires the Company to make assumptions that are difficult or subjective about matters that were highly uncertain at the time that the accounting estimate was made, and changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur in periods subsequent to the period in which the estimate was made, or use of different estimates that the Company could have used in the current period, would have a material impact on the Company s financial condition or results of operations. The most critical accounting policies inherent in the preparation of the Company s consolidated financial statements are described below. We continue to monitor our accounting policies to ensure proper application of current rules and regulations. 
 
 Oil and Natural Gas Properties - full cost ceiling calculation and depletion 
 
 Policy Description 
 
 We use the full cost method of accounting for our oil and natural gas properties under which we are required to conduct quarterly calculations of a ceiling, or limitation, on the carrying value of oil and natural gas properties . The ceiling limitation is the sum of 1) the discounted present value (at 10 ), using average first-day-of-the-month prices during the 12-month period ending as of the balance sheet date held constant over the life of the reserves, of Barnwell s estimated future net cash flows from estimated production of proved oil and natural gas reserves, less estimated future expenditures to be incurred in developing and producing the proved reserves but excluding future cash outflows associated with settling asset retirement obligations with the exception of those associated with proved undeveloped reserves from wells that are to be drilled in the future; plus 2) the cost of major development projects and unproven properties not subject to depletion, if any; plus 3) the lower of cost or estimated fair value of unproven properties included in costs subject to depletion; less 4) related income tax effects. If net capitalized costs exceed this limit, the excess is expensed. 
 
 All items classified as unevaluated and unproved properties are assessed on a quarterly basis for possible impairment or reduction in value. Properties are assessed on an individual basis or as a group if properties are individually insignificant. The assessment includes consideration of various factors, including, but not limited to, the following: intent to drill; remaining lease term; geological and geophysical evaluations; drilling results and activity; assignment of proved reserves; and economic viability of development if proved reserves are assigned. During any period in which these factors indicate an impairment, the cumulative drilling costs incurred to date for such property and all or a portion of the associated leasehold costs are transferred to the full cost pool and become subject to amortization. 
 
 Judgments and Assumptions 
 
 The estimate of our oil and natural gas reserves is a major component of the ceiling calculation and represents the component that requires the most subjective judgments. Estimates of reserves are forecasts based on engineering data, historical data, projected future rates of production and the timing of future expenditures. The process of estimating oil and natural gas reserves requires substantial judgment, resulting in imprecise determinations, particularly for new discoveries. Our reserve estimates are prepared at least annually by independent petroleum reserve engineers. The passage of time provides more quantitative and qualitative information regarding estimates of reserves, and revisions are made to prior estimates to reflect updated information. A portion of the revisions are attributable to changes in the rolling 12-month average first-day-of-the-month prices, which impact the economics of producible reserves. In the last three fiscal years, annual revisions to our reserve volume estimates have averaged 
 38 

36 of the previous year s estimate, due in large part to the impacts of volatile oil and natural gas prices which change the economic viability of producing such reserves and changes in estimated proved undeveloped reserves which can fluctuate from year to year depending upon the Company's plans and ability to fund the capital expenditures necessary to develop such reserves. There can be no assurance that more significant revisions will not be necessary in the future. If future significant revisions are necessary that reduce previously estimated reserve quantities, such revisions could result in a write-down of oil and natural gas properties. 
 
 If reported reserve volumes were revised downward by 5 at the end of fiscal 2021, the ceiling limitation would have decreased approximately 398,000 before income taxes, which would not have resulted in an increase in the ceiling impairment before income taxes due to sufficient room between the ceiling and the carrying value of oil and natural gas properties at the end of fiscal 2021 of approximately 5,716,000. 
 
 In addition to the impact of the estimates of proved reserves on the calculation of the ceiling, estimated proved reserves are also a significant component of the quarterly calculation of depletion expense. The lower the estimated reserves, the higher the depletion rate per unit of production. Conversely, the higher the estimated reserves, the lower the depletion rate per unit of production. If reported reserve volumes were revised downward by 5 as of the beginning of fiscal 2021, depletion for fiscal 2021 would have increased by approximately 26,000. 
 
 While the quantities of proved reserves require substantial judgment, the associated prices of oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids reserves are the average first-day-of-the-month prices during the 12-month period ending in the reporting period on a constant basis as prescribed by SEC regulations. Additionally, the applicable discount rate that is used to calculate the discounted present value of the reserves is mandated at 10 . Costs included in future net revenues are determined in a similar manner. As such, the future net revenues associated with the estimated proved reserves are not based on an assessment of future prices or costs. 
 
 Contract Drilling Revenues and Operating Expenses 
 
 Policy Description 
 
 Through contracts which are normally less than twelve months in duration, Barnwell drills water and water monitoring wells and installs and repairs water pumping systems in Hawaii. Barnwell recognizes revenue from well drilling or the installation of pumps over time based on total costs incurred on the projects relative to the total expected costs to satisfy the performance obligation as management believes this is an accurate representation of the percentage of completion as control is continuously transferred to the customer. Uninstalled materials, which typically consists of well casing or pumps, are excluded in the costs-to-costs calculation for the duration of the contract as including these costs would result in a distortion of progress towards satisfaction of the performance obligation due to the resulting cumulative catch-up in margin in a single period. An equal amount of cost and revenue is recorded when uninstalled materials are controlled by the customer, which is typically when Barnwell has the right to payment for the materials and when the materials are delivered to the customer s site or location and such materials have been accepted by the customer. Uninstalled materials are held in inventory and included in Other current assets on the Company s Consolidated Balance Sheets until control is transferred to the customer. When the estimate on a contract indicates a loss, Barnwell records the entire estimated loss in the period the loss becomes known. 
 
 39 

Unexpected significant inefficiencies that were not considered a risk at the time of entering into the contract, such as design or construction execution errors that result in significant wasted resources, are excluded from the measure of progress toward completion and the costs are expensed as incurred. 
 
 To the extent a contract is deemed to have multiple performance obligations, the Company allocates the transaction price of the contract to each performance obligation using its best estimate of the standalone selling price of each distinct good or service in the contract. The contract price may include variable consideration, which includes such items as increases to the transaction price for unapproved change orders and claims for which price has not yet been agreed by the customer. The Company estimates variable consideration using either the most likely amount or expected value method, whichever is a more appropriate reflection of the amount to which it expects to be entitled based on the characteristics and circumstances of the contract. Variable consideration is included in the estimated transaction price to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative recognized revenue will not occur. 
 
 Contracts are sometimes modified for a change in scope or other requirements. The Company considers contract modifications to exist when the modification either creates new or changes the existing enforceable rights and obligations. Most of the Company s contract modifications are for goods and services that are not distinct from the existing performance obligations. The effect of a contract modification on the transaction price, and the measure of progress for the performance obligation to which it relates, is recognized as an adjustment to revenue (either as an increase or decrease) on a cumulative catchup basis. 
 
 Judgments and Assumptions 
 
 Management evaluates the performance of contracts on an individual basis. In the ordinary course of business, but at least quarterly, we prepare updated estimates that may impact the cost and profit or loss for each contract based on actual results to date plus management s best estimate of costs to be incurred to complete each performance obligation. Increases or decreases in the estimated costs to complete a performance obligation without a change to the contract price has the impact to decrease or increase, respectively, the contract completion percentage applied to the contract price to calculate the cumulative contract revenue to be recognized to date. Changes in the cost estimates can have a material impact on our contract revenue and are reflected in the results of operations when they become known. The nature of accounting for these contracts is such that refinements of the estimated costs to complete may occur and are characteristic of the estimation process due to changing conditions and new developments. Many factors and assumptions can and do change during a contract performance obligation period which can result in a change to contract profitability including unforeseen underground geological conditions (to the extent that contract remedies are unavailable), the availability and costs of skilled contract labor, the performance of major material suppliers, the performance of major subcontractors, unusual weather conditions and unexpected changes in material costs, changes in the scope and nature of work to be performed, and unexpected construction execution errors, among others. Any revisions to estimated costs to complete the performance obligation from period to period as a result of changes in these factors can materially affect revenue and operating results in the period such revisions are necessary. In addition, many contracts give the customer a unilateral right to cancel for convenience or other than for cause. In accordance with FASB ASC 606-10-32-4, our estimates are based on the assumption that the existing contract will not be cancelled. Any unforeseen cancellation of a contract may result in a material revision to our estimates. 
 
 We have a long history of working with multiple types of projects and preparing cost estimates, and we rely on the expertise of key personnel to prepare what we believe are reasonable best estimates 
 40 

given available facts and circumstances. Due to the nature of the work involved, however, judgment is involved to estimate the costs to complete and the amounts estimated could have a material impact on the revenue we recognize in each accounting period. We can not estimate unforeseen events and circumstances which may result in actual results being materially different from previous estimates. 
 
 Income Taxes 
 
 Policy Description 
 
 Income taxes are determined using the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax impacts of differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. 
 
 Deferred income tax assets are routinely assessed for realizability. A valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. 
 
 Barnwell recognizes the financial statement effects of tax positions when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained by a taxing authority. 
 
 Judgments and Assumptions 
 
 We make estimates and judgments in determining our income tax expense for each reporting period. Significant changes to these estimates could result in an increase or decrease in our tax provision in future periods. We are also required to make judgments about the recoverability of deferred tax assets and when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized, a valuation allowance is provided. We consider available positive and negative evidence and available tax planning strategies when assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets. Accordingly, changes in our business performance and unforeseen events could require a further increase in the valuation allowance or a reversal in the valuation allowance in future periods. This could result in a charge to, or an increase in, income in the period such determination is made, and the impact of these changes could be material. 
 
 In addition, Barnwell operates within the U.S. and Canada and is subject to audit by taxing authorities in these jurisdictions. Barnwell records accruals for the estimated outcomes of these audits, and the accruals may change in the future due to new developments in each matter. Tax benefits are recognized when we determine that it is more likely than not that such benefits will be realized. Management evaluates its potential exposures from tax positions taken that have or could be challenged by taxing authorities. These potential exposures result because taxing authorities may take positions that differ from those taken by management in the interpretation and application of statutes, regulations and rules. Management considers the possibility of alternative outcomes based upon past experience, previous actions by taxing authorities (e.g., actions taken in other jurisdictions) and advice from tax experts. Where uncertainty exists due to the complexity of income tax statutes and where the potential tax amounts are significant, we generally seek independent tax opinions to support our positions. If our evaluation of the likelihood of the realization of benefits is inaccurate, we could incur additional income tax and interest expense that would adversely impact earnings, or we could receive tax benefits greater than anticipated which would positively impact earnings, either of which could be material. 
 41 

Overview 
 
 Barnwell is engaged in the following lines of business: 1) acquiring, developing, producing and selling oil and natural gas in Canada and Oklahoma (oil and natural gas segment), 2) investing in land interests in Hawaii (land investment segment), and 3) drilling wells and installing and repairing water pumping systems in Hawaii (contract drilling segment). 
 
 Oil and Natural Gas Segment 
 
 Barnwell is involved in the acquisition and development of oil and natural gas properties in Canada where we initiate and participate in acquisition and developmental operations for oil and natural gas on properties in which we have an interest, and evaluate proposals by third parties with regard to participation in exploratory and developmental operations elsewhere. Additionally, through its wholly-owned subsidiary BOK, Barnwell is indirectly involved in several non-operated oil and natural gas investments in Oklahoma. 
 
 Barnwell sells all of its oil and natural gas under short-term contracts with marketers based on prices indexed to market prices. The price of natural gas, oil and natural gas liquids is freely negotiated between the buyers and sellers. Oil and natural gas prices are determined by many factors that are outside of our control. Market prices for oil and natural gas products are dependent upon factors such as, but not limited to, changes in market supply and demand, which are impacted by overall economic activity, changes in weather, pipeline capacity constraints, inventory storage levels, and output. Oil and natural gas prices are very difficult to predict and fluctuate significantly. Natural gas prices tend to be higher in the winter than in the summer due to increased demand, although this trend has become less pronounced due to the increased use of natural gas to generate electricity for air conditioning in the summer and increased natural gas storage capacity in North America. 
 
 Oil and natural gas exploration, development and operating costs generally follow trends in product market prices, thus in times of higher product prices the cost of exploring, developing and operating the oil and natural gas properties will tend to escalate as well. Capital expenditures are required to fund the exploration, development, and production of oil and natural gas. Cash outlays for capital expenditures are largely discretionary, however, a minimum level of capital expenditures is required to replace depleting reserves. Due to the nature of oil and natural gas exploration and development, significant uncertainty exists as to the ultimate success of any drilling effort. 
 
 Land Investment Segment 
 
 Through Barnwell s 77.6 interest in Kaupulehu Developments, 75 interest in KD Kona, and 34.45 non-controlling interest in KKM Makai, the Company s land investment interests include the following: 
 
 The right to receive percentage of sales payments from KD I resulting from the sale of single-family residential lots by KD I, within Increment I of the Kaupulehu Lot 4A area located in the North Kona District of the island of Hawaii. Kaupulehu Developments is entitled to receive payments from KD I based on the following percentages of the gross receipts from KD I s sales at Increment I: 10 of such aggregate gross proceeds greater than 100,000,000 up to 300,000,000; and 14 of such aggregate gross proceeds in excess 
 42 

of 300,000,000. Inventory of unsold lots at Increment I were nine single-family lots at September 30, 2021. 
 
 The right to receive 15 of the distributions of KD II, the cost of which is to be solely borne by KDK out of its 55 ownership interest in KD II, plus a priority payout of 10 of KDK's cumulative net profits derived from Increment II sales subsequent to Phase 2A, up to a maximum of 3,000,000. Such interests are limited to distributions or net profits interests and Barnwell does not have any partnership interest in KD II or KDK through its interest in Kaupulehu Developments. Barnwell also has rights to three single-family residential lots in Phase 2A of Increment II, and four single-family residential lots in phases subsequent to Phase 2A when such lots are developed by KD II, all at no cost to Barnwell. Barnwell is committed to commence construction of improvements within 90 days of the transfer of the four lots in the phases subsequent to Phase 2A as a condition of the transfer of such lots. Also, in addition to Barnwell's existing obligations to pay professional fees to certain parties based on percentages of its gross receipts, Kaupulehu Developments is now also obligated to pay an amount equal to 0.72 and 0.20 of the cumulative net profits of KD II to KD Development and a pool of various individuals, respectively, all of whom are partners of KKM and are unrelated to Barnwell. Two developed single-family lots were sold in Increment II in prior years and the remaining 420 developable acres at Increment II are entitled for up to 350 homesites. The remaining acreage within Increment II is not yet under development, and there is no assurance that development of such acreage will in fact occur. No definitive development plans have been made by the developer of Increment II as of the date of this report. 
 
 An indirect 19.6 non-controlling ownership interest in KD Kukio Resorts, KD Maniniowali and KD I and an indirect 10.8 non-controlling ownership interest in KD II through KDK. These entities own certain real estate and development rights interests in the Kukio, Maniniowali and Kaupulehu portions of Kukio Resort, a private residential community on the Kona coast of the island of Hawaii, as well as Kukio Resort s real estate sales office operations. KDK was the developer of Kaupulehu Lot 4A Increments I and II. The partnerships derive income from the sale of residential parcels as well as from commissions on real estate sales by the real estate sales office and revenues resulting from the sale of private club memberships. 
 
 Approximately 1,000 acres of vacant leasehold land zoned conservation in the Kaupulehu Lot 4C area, which currently has no development potential without both a development agreement with the lessor and zoning reclassification. 
 
 Contract Drilling Segment 
 
 Barnwell drills water and water monitoring wells and installs and repairs water pumping systems in Hawaii. Contract drilling results are highly dependent upon the quantity, dollar value and timing of contracts awarded by governmental and private entities and can fluctuate significantly. 
 
 43 

Business Environment 
 
 Our operations are located in Canada and in the states of Hawaii and Oklahoma. Accordingly, our business performance is directly affected by macroeconomic conditions in those areas, as well as general economic conditions of the U.S. domestic and world economies. 
 
 Oil and Natural Gas Segment 
 
 Barnwell realized an average price for oil of 51.74 per barrel during the year ended September 30, 2021, an increase of 53 from 33.85 per barrel realized during the prior year. While oil prices have recovered from the significant lows of March and May of the prior year, the Company is unable to reasonably predict future oil prices and the impacts future oil prices will have on the Company. 
 
 Barnwell realized an average price for natural gas of 2.62 per Mcf during the year ended September 30, 2021, an increase of 60 from 1.64 per Mcf realized during the prior year. 
 
 Land Investment Segment 
 
 Future land investment payments and any future cash distributions from our investment in the Kukio Resort Land Development Partnerships are dependent upon the sale of the remaining nine residential lots within Increment I by KD I and potential future development or sale of the remaining portion of Increment II by KD II of Kaupulehu Lot 4A. The amount and timing of future land investment segment proceeds from percentage of sales payments and cash distributions from the Kukio Resort Land Development Partnerships are highly uncertain and out of our control, and there is no assurance with regards to the amounts of future sales of residential lots within Increments I and II. No definitive development plans have been made by the developer of Increment II as of the date of this report. 
 
 Barnwell estimates that it will be partially reliant upon land investment segment proceeds in order to provide sufficient liquidity to fund our operations in 2022 and beyond. However, there can be no assurance that the amount of future land investment segment proceeds will provide the liquidity required. 
 
 Contract Drilling Segment 
 
 Demand for water well drilling and/or pump installation and repair services is volatile and dependent upon land development activities within the state of Hawaii. Management currently estimates that well drilling activity for fiscal 2022 will be significantly lower than fiscal 2021 based upon the number and value of contracts in backlog.

 Summary 
 
 Net earnings attributable to Barnwell for fiscal 2021 totaled 6,253,000, an 11,009,000 increase in operating results from a net loss of 4,756,000 in fiscal 2020. The following factors affected the results of operations for the current fiscal year as compared to the prior fiscal year: 
 
 A 6,653,000 improvement in oil and natural gas segment operating results, before income taxes, primarily attributable to a decrease in the ceiling test impairment which was 4,326,000 in the prior year period, compared to a ceiling test impairment of 630,000 in the current year 
 44 

period. Also contributing to the increase was a significant increase in oil and natural gas prices in the current period as compared to the same period in the prior year; 
 
 A 5,441,000 increase in equity in income from affiliates as a result of increased operating results of the Kukio Resort Land Development Partnerships; 
 
 A 1,463,000 increase in land investment segment operating results, before non-controlling interests share of such profits, due to the sale of eight lots in the current period, whereas there were only two lot sales in the same period in the prior year; 
 
 A 2,341,000 gain recognized in the current year period from the termination of the Company s Post-retirement Medical plan and 1,982,000 in gains from the sales of assets in the current year period; 
 
 A 3,214,000 decrease in contract drilling segment operating results, before income taxes, primarily resulting from decreased activity attributable to a significant well drilling contract as this contract was essentially completed as of December 31, 2020; 
 
 A 1,268,000 increase in general and administrative expenses primarily due to increases in share-based compensation expense, bonuses and director fees, and costs related to the cooperation and support agreement with the MRMP Stockholders in the current year period as compared to the same period in the prior year, partially offset by a reduction in legal fees in the current year period as compared to the same period in the prior year; and 
 
 A 1,336,000 gain recognized in the prior year period from the sale of the Company s leasehold interest in a three-quarter of an acre contract drilling segment maintenance and storage yard in Honolulu, Hawaii, whereas there was no such gain in the current period. 
 
 General 
 
 Barnwell conducts operations in the U.S. and Canada. Consequently, Barnwell is subject to foreign currency translation and transaction gains and losses due to fluctuations of the exchange rates between the Canadian dollar and the U.S. dollar. Barnwell cannot accurately predict future fluctuations of the exchange rates and the impact of such fluctuations may be material from period to period. To date, we have not entered into foreign currency hedging transactions. 
 
 The average exchange rate of the Canadian dollar to the U.S. dollar increased 6 in fiscal 2021, as compared to fiscal 2020, and the exchange rate of the Canadian dollar to the U.S. dollar increased 5 at September 30, 2021, as compared to September 30, 2020. Accordingly, the assets, liabilities, stockholders equity and revenues and expenses of Barnwell s subsidiaries operating in Canada have been adjusted to reflect the change in the exchange rates. Barnwell s Canadian dollar liabilities are greater than its Canadian dollar assets; therefore, increases or decreases in the value of the Canadian dollar to the U.S. dollar generate other comprehensive loss or income, respectively. Other comprehensive income and losses are not included in net earnings (loss). Other comprehensive loss due to foreign currency translation adjustments, net of taxes, for fiscal 2021 was 283,000, a 137,000 change from other comprehensive loss due to foreign currency translation adjustments, net of taxes, of 146,000 in fiscal 2020. There were no taxes on other comprehensive loss due to foreign currency translation adjustments in fiscal 2021 and 2020 due to a full valuation allowance on the related deferred tax assets.

Oil and natural gas 
 
 Selected Operating Statistics 
 
 The following tables set forth Barnwell s annual average prices per unit of production and annual net production volumes for fiscal 2021 as compared to fiscal 2020. Production amounts reported are net of royalties. 
 
 Annual Average Price Per Unit Increase (Decrease) 2021 2020 Natural gas (Mcf) 2.62 1.64 0.98 60 Oil (Bbls) 51.74 33.85 17.89 53 Liquids (Bbls) 31.92 17.16 14.76 86

 _________________________________________________ 
 Natural gas price per unit is net of pipeline charges. 
 
 The oil and natural gas segment generated a 2,423,000 operating profit in fiscal 2021 before general and administrative expenses, an increase in operating results of 6,653,000 as compared to 4,230,000 of operating loss in fiscal 2020. There was a 630,000 ceiling test impairment included in the operating profit in the current year as compared to a 4,326,000 ceiling test impairment in the prior year. 
 
 Oil and natural gas revenues increased 3,561,000 (53 from 6,693,000 in fiscal 2020 to 10,254,000 in fiscal 2021, primarily due to significant increases in oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids prices as compared to the same periods in the prior as prior year's commodity prices were impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. 
 
 Oil and natural gas operating expenses increased 1,706,000 (35 from 4,850,000 in fiscal 2020 to 6,556,000 in fiscal 2021, primarily due to equalization of operating costs related to processing facilities and workovers in the current year period and to a lesser degree due to carbon taxes, whereas there were no such costs in the prior year period, as well as due to lower operating costs in the prior year period due to the aforementioned low commodity prices. 
 
 Oil and natural gas segment depletion decreased 1,102,000 from 1,747,000 in fiscal 2020 to 645,000 in fiscal 2021, primarily due to a decrease in the depletion rate for the current year period, as compared to the same period in prior year, due primarily to impairment write-downs in the prior year. 
 
 Net oil production during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021 decreased 4 due largely to a natural decline in oil production from the Spirit River area as compared to the prior year period. In addition, the Company sold its oil and natural gas properties in the Spirit River area in July 2021. The 
 46 

decrease was partially offset by an increase in production from the Twining area due largely to the acquisition of additional wells in the area. Net natural gas and natural gas liquids production increased 7 and 14 , respectively, as compared to the same period of the prior year, also due largely to the acquisition of additional wells in the Twining area, partially offset by a decrease in production due to the sale of oil and natural gas properties in the Hillsdown area in April 2021. 
 
 While oil prices have recovered from the significant lows of March through May of the prior year, the Company is unable to reasonably predict future oil prices and the impacts future oil prices will have on the Company. 
 
 Sale of interest in leasehold land 
 
 Kaupulehu Developments is entitled to receive a percentage of the gross receipts from the sales of lots and/or residential units in Increment I by KD I. 
 
 The following table summarizes the revenues received from KD I and the amount of fees directly related to such revenues: 
 Year ended September 30, 2021 2020 Sale of interest in leasehold land: Revenues - sale of interest in leasehold land 1,738,000 325,000 Fees - included in general and administrative expenses (212,000) (40,000) Sale of interest in leasehold land, net of fees paid 1,526,000 285,000 
 
 During the year ended September 30, 2021, Barnwell received 1,738,000 in percentage of sales payments from KD I from the sale of eight single-family lots within Phase II of Increment I. During the year ended September 30, 2020, Barnwell received 325,000 in percentage of sales payments from KD I from the sale of two single-family lots within Phase II of Increment I. 
 
 Subsequent to the close of the year ended September 30, 2021, Kaupulehu Developments received percentage of sales payments totaling 600,000 from the sale of three lots within Phase II of Increment I. Financial results from the receipt of these payment will be reflected in Barnwell's quarter ending December 31, 2021. Accordingly, with the inclusion of the lot sales subsequent to September 30, 2021, six single-family lots of the 80 lots developed within Increment I remained to be sold as of the date of this report. The Company does not have a controlling interest in Increments I and II, and there is no assurance with regards to the amounts of future sales from Increments I and II, or that the remaining acreage within Increment II will be developed. No definitive development plans have been made by the developer of Increment II as of the date of this report. 
 
 Contract drilling 
 
 Contract drilling revenues and costs are associated with well drilling and water pump installation, replacement and repair in Hawaii. 
 
 Contract drilling revenues decreased 5,185,000 (47 to 5,809,000 in fiscal 2021, as compared to 10,994,000 in fiscal 2020, and contract drilling costs decreased 1,958,000 (26 to 5,555,000 in fiscal 2021, as compared to 7,513,000 in fiscal 2020. The contract drilling segment generated an 89,000 operating loss before general and administrative expenses during fiscal 2021, a decrease in operating 
 47 

results of 3,214,000 as compared to an operating profit before general and administrative expenses of 3,125,000 in fiscal 2020. The decrease in operating results was primarily due to a significant well drilling contract in the prior year period. The significant well drilling contract was for multiple wells and was based on a fixed rate per day or fixed rate per hour, depending upon the activity, as opposed to the Company's typical contracts that are based on a fixed price per lineal foot drilled. Up to three drilling rigs were being used at this job during the prior year period with crews working extended hours. However, activity related to this contract was essentially completed in the quarter ended December 31, 2020 and thus contract drilling revenues and costs have decreased in the current year period as compared to the same period of the prior year. 
 
 At September 30, 2021, there was a backlog of six well drilling and ten pump installation and repair contracts, of which five well drilling and nine pump installation and repair contracts were in progress as of September 30, 2021. The backlog of contract drilling revenues as of December 1, 2021 was approximately 9,500,000, of which 5,900,000 is expected to be realized in fiscal 2022 with the remainder to be recognized in the following fiscal year. Based on these contracts in backlog, contract drilling segment operating profit is estimated to be higher in fiscal 2022 as compared to fiscal 2021. 
 
 In the quarter ended December 31, 2019, the Company experienced the failure of a hole opener which broke apart leaving pieces in the bottom of a water well being drilled in Hawaii. Efforts to remove the items from the well were unsuccessful through the quarter ended March 31, 2020 and subsequently the Company determined that the well should be abandoned and a new well drilled at no incremental cost to the customer as per the terms of the contract. Accordingly, all the costs to drill and abandon the first well, which are all wasted costs, were excluded from the measurement of progress toward contract completion and all such costs were fully accrued in the quarter ended March 31, 2020, as this contract was determined to be a loss job. In September 2020, while making progress towards the drilling of a replacement well in different location, the drill string twisted off and became lodged in the well borehole, which required a stoppage of drilling and the need to dislodge and retrieve the broken drill string. Accordingly, the estimated total rework costs to remediate the situation was accrued at September 30, 2020. In January 2021, the broken drill string was retrieved from the well borehole and drilling of the replacement well recommenced. 
 
 In the year ended September 30, 2019, two of the water wells drilled by the contract drilling segment for one customer were determined to not meet the contract specifications for plumbness. Subsequently, in the quarter ended March 31, 2020, the Company executed a separate five-year warranty agreement with the customer for one of the wells that did not meet plumbness. Under the terms of the agreement, if the lack of plumbness is determined to be the cause of a pump failure within the warranty period, the Company would be obligated to replace the pump at no cost to the customer. If the Company is unable to replace the pump using industry-standard methods, or if there are two or more pump failures attributable to lack of plumbness within the five-year warranty period, the Company would be obligated to drill a new well at no cost to the customer. Negotiations with the customer are currently ongoing for the other well that the customer claims did not meet plumbness despite the fact that the independent consulting engineer for the job concluded that the most recent plumbness test, completed after the well was cased with casing cemented into place as per the contract, showed that the well meets the plumbness specifications of the contract. Management believes the degrees of deviation for both wells are not impactful to the performance of the submersible pumps that will be installed in those wells. Accordingly, no accruals have been recorded as of September 30, 2021 as there is no probable or estimable contingent liability. 
 
 48 

In July 2020, the Staff of the State of Hawaii s Commission on Water Resource Management Commission circulated a draft of a proposed recommendation to the Commission under which the Company, the water utility, the water utility's independent hydrologist firm and the owner of the land on which the two aforementioned water wells were drilled would be assessed penalty fines because each of the wells were calculated to have been drilled beyond the depth permitted by the permit. The wells were drilled to a depth to penetrate certain layers of impermeable rock necessary to access the aquifer at the instructions and on the advice of the hydrologist hired by the owner of the well. The Company s share of the proposed penalties and fines was originally calculated to approximately 1,200,000. Subsequently, the Staff of the Commission acknowledged that one well had not been drilled to a depth beyond its permitted depth and the fines on that well were eliminated. Additionally, the fines applicable to the depth of the second well were dropped in lieu of the parties entering into an agreement to perform a water quality study and repurpose a current well into a monitoring well. Accordingly, the Company recorded a contingent liability of approximately 300,000 at September 30, 2020 and no subsequent revision to the accrual has been recorded as of September 30, 2021. 
 
 There has been a significant decrease in demand for water well drilling contracts in recent years that has generally led to increased competition for available contracts and lower margins on awarded contracts. The Company is unable to predict the near-term and long-term availability of water well drilling and pump installation and repair contracts as a result of this volatility in demand. While the Company s contract drilling segment remained operational throughout fiscal 2020 and 2021 and continues to work, the continuing potential impact of COVID-19 on the health of our contract drilling segment's crew and ability or desire for customers to continue such work is uncertain, and any discontinuation of contracts currently in backlog for any reason would result in a material adverse impact to the Company s financial condition and outlook. 
 
 General and administrative expenses 
 
 General and administrative expenses increased 1,268,000 (22 to 7,088,000 in fiscal 2021, as compared to 5,820,000 in fiscal 2020. The increase was primarily due to increases in share-based compensation expense, bonuses and director fees, and costs related to the cooperation and support agreement with the MRMP Stockholders as discussed below, in the current year period as compared to the same period in the prior year. The increase was partially offset by a reduction in fees related to legal services, proxy solicitation, proxy advisory, and public relation costs in the current year period as compared to the same period in the prior year. 
 
 In January 2021, the Company entered into a cooperation and support agreement with MRMP-Managers LLC, Ned L. Sherwood Revocable Trust, Ned L. Sherwood and Bradley M. Tirpak (collectively, the MRMP Stockholders ), with respect to the potential proxy contest pertaining to the election of directors to our Board of Directors. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, among other things, the Company and the MRMP Stockholders agreed on certain nominations and voting with respect to the directors nominated to stand for reelection to the Board of Directors at the 2021 annual meeting of stockholders, which was held on April 20, 2021. The Company agreed to reimburse the MRMP Stockholders for their reasonable, documented out-of-pocket fees and expenses (including legal expenses) of up to a maximum of 300,000 in connection with the MRMP Stockholders election contest at the Company s 2020 annual meeting of stockholders and the negotiation of this agreement and accordingly, incurred approximately 296,000 in expenses related to this agreement in the year ended September 30, 2021. 
 
 49 

Depletion, depreciation, and amortization 
 
 Depletion, depreciation, and amortization decreased 1,184,000 (55 in fiscal 2021 as compared to fiscal 2020 primarily due to a decrease in the oil and natural gas depletion rates as a result of ceiling test impairment write-downs in the prior year as discussed in the Oil and natural gas section above. 
 
 Impairment of assets 
 
 Under the full cost method of accounting, the Company performs quarterly oil and natural gas ceiling test calculations. There was a ceiling test impairment of 630,000 during the year ended September 30, 2021. There was a 4,326,000 ceiling test impairment during the year ended September 30, 2020. 
 
 Changes in the mandated 12-month historical rolling average first-day-of-the-month prices for oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids prices, the value of reserve additions as compared to the amount of capital expenditures to obtain them, and changes in production rates and estimated levels of reserves, future development costs and the estimated market value of unproved properties, impact the determination of the maximum carrying value of oil and natural gas properties. 
 
 In September 2021, the Company designated a contract drilling segment drilling rig and related ancillary equipment, with an aggregate net carrying value of 725,000, as assets held for sale and recorded an impairment of 38,000 to reduce the value of these assets to its fair value, less estimated selling costs. The fair value of these assets in the aggregate amount of 687,000 is recorded as Assets held for sale on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet at September 30, 2021. 
 
 During the year ended September 30, 2020, the Company recorded a 50,000 impairment in the carrying value of its investment in leasehold land interest in Lot 4C as a result of recent uncertainty regarding the timing of future development and potential use of water rights within Lot 4C prior to the expiration of the lease term. The lease terminates in December 2025. 
 
 Gain on termination of Post-Retirement Medical plan 
 
 In June 2021, the Company terminated its Post-retirement Medical plan, which covered officers of the Company who had attained at least 20 years of service of which at least 10 years were at the position of Vice President or higher, their spouses and qualifying dependents, effective June 4, 2021. Pursuant to the Post-retirement Medical plan document, the Company, as the sponsor of the Post-retirement Medical plan, had the right to terminate the plan within sixty days notice to each participant and the plan may be terminated by the resolution of the Board of the Directors of the Company. Further, under the terms of the plan document, the participants in the Post-retirement Medical plan were not entitled to any unpaid vested benefits thereunder upon plan termination. The Post-retirement Medical plan was an unfunded plan and the Company funded benefits when payments were made. As a result of the plan termination, the Company recognized a non-cash gain of 2,341,000 during the year ended September 30, 2021. 
 
 Gain on sale of assets 
 
 On July 8, 2021, Barnwell entered into and completed a purchase and sale agreement with an independent third party and sold its interests in certain natural gas and oil properties located in the Spirit River area of Alberta, Canada. The sales price per the agreement was adjusted for customary purchase price adjustments to 1,047,000 in order to, among other things, reflect an economic effective closing date of sale of July 8, 2021. From Barnwell's net proceeds, 526,000 was withheld for remittance by the buyers 
 50 

to the Canada Revenue Agency for potential amounts due for Barnwell s Canadian income taxes related to the sale. 
 
 The difference in the relationship between capitalized costs and proved reserves of the Spirit River properties sold as compared to the properties retained by Barnwell was significant as there was a 93 difference in capitalized costs divided by proved reserves if the gain was recorded versus the gain being credited against the full-cost pool. Accordingly, Barnwell recorded a gain on the sale of Spirit River of 818,000 in the year ended September 30, 2021 in accordance with the guidance in Rule 4-10(c)(6)(i) of Regulation S-X of the rules and regulations of the SEC, which requires an allocation of capitalized costs to the reserves sold and reserves retained on the basis of the relative fair values of the properties as there was a substantial economic difference between the properties sold and those retained. Also included in the gain calculation were asset retirement obligations of 77,000 assumed by the purchaser. 
 
 On September 30, 2021, the Company s Honolulu corporate office was sold for approximately 1,864,000, net of related costs, resulting in a gain of 1,164,000, which was recognized in the year ended September 30, 2021. 
 
 In March 2020, the Company sold its leasehold interest in a three-quarter of an acre contract drilling segment maintenance and storage yard in Honolulu, Hawaii to an unrelated third party for a 1,100,000 cash payment. As a result of the sale transaction, the Company recognized a gain of 1,336,000, inclusive of a 236,000 gain from the reversal of the storage yard's lease liability in excess of the right-of-use asset, in the year ended September 30, 2020. 
 
 Equity in income of affiliates 
 
 Barnwell s investment in the Kukio Resort Land Development Partnerships is accounted for using the equity method of accounting. Barnwell was allocated partnership income of 5,793,000 in fiscal 2021, as compared to allocated income of 352,000 in fiscal 2020. The increase in the allocated partnership income is primarily due to the Kukio Resort Land Development Partnerships' sale of eight lots during the current year, whereas there were two lot sales in the prior year. In addition, there was a significant increase in real estate resale activity in the current year period for which the Kukio Resort Land Development Partnerships' real estate sales office earns commissions revenue, as well as an increase in the Kukio Resort Land Development Partnerships' revenues related to an increase in club memberships sold. 
 
 The increase is also attributed to distributions received from the Kukio Resort Land Development Partnerships in excess of our investment balance of 654,000 which was recorded as income during the year ended September 30, 2021 and 459,000 in preferred return payments received from KKM in the year ended September 30, 2021. 
 
 During the year ended September 30, 2021, the Company received cumulative distributions from the Kukio Resort Land Development Partnerships in excess of our investment balance and in accordance with applicable accounting guidance, the Company suspended its equity method earnings recognition and reduced its Kukio Resort Land Development Partnership investment balance to zero as of September 30, 2021. In addition, the Company recorded the distributions received in excess of our investment balance of 654,000 as equity in income of affiliates during the year ended September 30, 2021. The Company records the distributions in excess of our investment in the Kukio Resort Land Development Partnerships as income because the distributions are not refundable by agreement or by law and the Company is not liable for the obligations of or otherwise committed to provide financial support to the Kukio Resort Land Development Partnerships. The Company will record future equity method earnings only after our share 
 51 

of the Kukio Resort Land Development Partnership s cumulative earnings during the suspended period exceeds our share of the Kukio Resort Land Development Partnership s income recognized for the excess distributions. 
 
 Barnwell has the right to receive distributions from the Kukio Resort Land Development Partnerships via its non-controlling interests in KD Kona and KKM, based on its respective partnership sharing ratios of 75 and 34.45 , respectively. Additionally, Barnwell was entitled to a preferred return from KKM on any allocated equity in income of the Kukio Resort Land Development Partnerships in excess of its partnership sharing ratio for cumulative distributions to all of its partners in excess of 45,000,000 from those partnerships. Cumulative distributions from the Kukio Resort Land Development Partnerships have reached the 45,000,000 threshold and in the quarter ended December 31, 2020, the Kukio Resort Land Development Partnerships made distributions in excess of the threshold out of the proceeds from the sale of two lots in Increment I. Accordingly, Barnwell received a total of 459,000 in preferred return payments, which is reflected as an additional equity pickup in the "Equity in income of affiliates" line item on the accompanying Consolidated Statement of Operations for the year ended September 30, 2021. The preferred return payments received in the quarter ended December 31, 2020 brought the cumulative preferred return total to 656,000, which is the total amount Barnwell was entitled to, and thus there is no more preferred return outstanding as of September 30, 2021. 
 
 During the year ended September 30, 2021, Barnwell received net cash distributions in the amount of 6,011,000 from the Kukio Resort Land Development Partnerships after distributing 683,000 to non-controlling interests. Of the 6,011,000 net cash distribution received from the Kukio Resort Land Development Partnerships, 459,000 represented a partial payment of the preferred return from KKM, as discussed above. 
 
 During the year ended September 30, 2020, Barnwell received net cash distributions in the amount of 360,000 from the Kukio Resort Land Development Partnerships after distributing 20,000 to non-controlling interests. Of the 360,000 net cash distribution received from the Kukio Resort Land Development Partnerships, 197,000 represented a partial payment of the preferred return from KKM. 
 
 Subsequent to the close of the year ended September 30, 2021, Kaupulehu Developments received percentage of sales payments totaling 600,000 from the sale of three lots within Phase II of Increment I. Financial results from the receipt of these payment will be reflected in Barnwell's quarter ending December 31, 2021. Accordingly, with the inclusion of the lot sales subsequent to September 30, 2021, six single-family lots of the 80 lots developed within Increment I remained to be sold as of the date of this report. The Company does not have a controlling interest in Increments I and II, and there is no assurance with regards to the amounts of future sales from Increments I and II, or that the remaining acreage within Increment II will be developed. No definitive development plans have been made by the developer of Increment II as of the date of this report.

Income taxes 
 
 The components of earnings (loss) before income taxes, after adjusting the earnings (loss) for non-controlling interests, are as follows: 
 Year ended September 30, 2021 2020 United States 5,436,000 1,518,000 Canada 1,149,000 (6,271,000) 6,585,000 (4,753,000) 
 
 Barnwell s effective consolidated income tax rate for fiscal 2021, after adjusting earnings (loss) before income taxes for non-controlling interests, was 5 as compared to nil for fiscal 2020. 
 Consolidated taxes do not bear a customary relationship to pretax results due primarily to the fact that the Company is taxed separately in Canada based on Canadian source operations and in the U.S. based on consolidated operations, and essentially all deferred tax assets, net of relevant offsetting deferred tax liabilities, are not estimated to have a future benefit as tax credits or deductions. Income from our non-controlling interest in the Kukio Resort Land Development Partnerships is treated as non-unitary for state of Hawaii unitary filing purposes, thus unitary Hawaii losses provide limited sheltering of such non-unitary income. Income from our investment in the Oklahoma oil venture is 100 allocable to Oklahoma, and therefore, receives no benefit from consolidated or unitary losses. 
 On June 28, 2019, the Government of Alberta reduced its corporate income tax rate from 12 to 11 , effective July 1, 2019, with further reductions in the rate by 1 on January 1 of every year until it reaches 8 on January 1, 2022. On June 29, 2020, the Government of Alberta introduced Alberta s Recovery Plan which will, among other things, reduce Alberta s general corporate income tax rate to 8 (from 10 effective July 1, 2020. This reduction was enacted in the quarter ended December 31, 2020. Canadian deferred tax assets and liabilities have been measured using the enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. Alberta rate changes have no significant impact to earnings/loss as a result of a full valuation allowance being applied to Canadian deferred tax assets. 
 Net earnings attributable to non-controlling interests 
 Earnings and losses attributable to non-controlling interests represent the non-controlling interests share of revenues and expenses related to the various partnerships and joint ventures in which Barnwell has controlling interests and consolidates. 
 
 Net earnings attributable to non-controlling interests totaled 950,000 in fiscal 2021, as compared to net earnings attributable to non-controlling interests of 79,000 in fiscal 2020. The 871,000 (1,103 increase is primarily due to increases in the amount of Kukio Resort Land Development Partnerships' income and percentage of sales proceeds received in the current year period as compared to the same period in the prior year. 
 
 Retirement plans curtailment 
 
 In December 2019, the Company s Board of Directors approved a resolution to freeze all future benefit accruals for all participants under the Company s defined benefit pension plan Pension Plan and Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan SERP effective December 31, 2019. Consequently, current participants in the Pension Plan and SERP no longer accrue new benefits under the plans and new employees of the Company are no longer eligible to enter the Pension Plan and SERP as participants after 
 53 

December 31, 2019. The freezing of the Pension Plan and SERP triggered a curtailment which required a remeasurement of the projected benefit obligations of the Pension Plan and SERP and resulted in a 1,726,000 reduction in unrecognized pension benefit costs that were previously included in accumulated other comprehensive loss, with a corresponding curtailment gain in other comprehensive income which was recorded during the year ended September 30, 2020. 
 
 Inflation 
 
 The effect of inflation on Barnwell has generally been to increase its cost of operations, general and administrative costs and direct costs associated with oil and natural gas production and contract drilling operations. Oil and natural gas prices realized by Barnwell are essentially determined by world prices for oil and western Canadian/Midwestern U.S. prices for natural gas. 
 
 Impact of Recently Issued Accounting Standards on Future Filings 
 
 In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, which replaces the incurred loss model with an expected loss model referred to as the current expected credit loss CECL model. The CECL model is applicable to the measurement of credit losses on financial assets measured at amortized cost, including but not limited to trade receivables. This ASU is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2022, and interim periods within those annual periods. The FASB has subsequently issued other related ASUs which amend ASU 2016-13 to provide clarification and additional guidance. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of these standards. 
 
 In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes, which enhances and simplifies various aspects of the income tax accounting guidance in ASC 740. This ASU is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2020 and interim periods within those annual periods, with early adoption permitted. The adoption of this update is not expected to have a material impact on Barnwell's consolidated financial statements. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 Barnwell s primary sources of liquidity are cash on hand, cash flow generated by operations, land investment segment proceeds, and starting in fiscal 2021, funds generated by the ATM program. At September 30, 2021, Barnwell had 12,134,000 in working capital. 
 
 Cash Flows 
 
 Cash flows provided by operating activities totaled 831,000 for fiscal 2021, as compared to cash flows provided by operating activities of 750,000 for the same period in fiscal 2020. This 81,000 change in operating cash flows was primarily due to a significant increase in distributions of income from the Kukio Resort Land Development Partnerships in the current year period, as compared to the prior year, and higher operating results, before non-cash impairment expenses, for the oil and natural gas segment, which was partially offset by significantly lower operating results for the contract drilling segment in the current year period as compared to the prior year period. The change was also due to fluctuations in working capital, primarily attributed to fluctuations in other current assets and accounts payable in the current period as compared to the prior year period. 
 
 54 

Net cash provided by investing activities totaled 3,686,000 for fiscal 2021, as compared to net cash used in investing activities of 833,000 for fiscal 2020. The 4,519,000 increase in investing cash flows was primarily due to a decrease of 1,193,000 in cash paid for oil and natural gas capital expenditures, a 1,241,000 increase in percentage of sales proceeds received, net of fees, an increase of 1,344,000 received in distributions from equity investees in excess of earnings, and a net increase of 764,000 in proceeds from the sale of assets related to the sale of the Company's Honolulu corporate office in the current year period and the sale of the Company's leasehold interest in a three-quarter of an acre contract drilling segment maintenance and storage yard in Honolulu, Hawaii in the prior year period. 
 
 Cash flows provided by financing activities totaled 2,192,000 for fiscal 2021, as compared to cash flows provided by financing activities of 60,000 for fiscal 2020. The 2,132,000 change in financing cash flows was primarily attributed to 3,179,000 in proceeds from issuance of stock, net of costs, related to the Company's ATM offering in the current year period as compared to none in the prior year period, which was partially offset by an increase of 947,000 in distributions to non-controlling interests in the current year period. 
 
 Paycheck Protection Program Loan 
 
 On April 28, 2020, the Company, as obligor, entered into a promissory note evidencing an unsecured loan in the approximate amount of 147,000 under the Paycheck Protection Program PPP pursuant to the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act CARES that was signed into law in March 2020. The note was to mature two years after the date of the loan disbursement with interest at a fixed annual rate of 1.00 , and with the principal and interest payments deferred until ten months after the last day of the covered period. In April 2021, the Company was notified by the lender of our PPP loan that the entire PPP loan amount and related accrued interest was forgiven by the Small Business Administration. As a result of the loan forgiveness, the Company recognized a gain on debt extinguishment of 149,000 during the year ended September 30, 2021. 
 
 Canada Emergency Business Account Loan 
 
 In the quarter ended December 31, 2020, the Company s Canadian subsidiary, Barnwell of Canada, received a loan of CAD 40,000 under the Canada Emergency Business Account CEBA loan program for small businesses. In the quarter ended March 31, 2021, the Company applied for an increase to our CEBA loan and received an additional CAD 20,000 for a total loan amount received of CAD 60,000 47,000) under the program. The CEBA loan is interest-free with no principal payments required until December 31, 2022, after which the remaining loan balance is converted to a three year term loan at 5 annual interest paid monthly. If the Company repays 66.6 of the principal amount prior to December 31, 2022, there will be loan forgiveness of 33.3 up to a maximum of CAD 20,000. 
 
 At The Market Offering 
 
 On March 16, 2021, the Company entered into a Sales Agreement with A.G.P./Alliance Global Partners A.G.P, ), with respect to the ATM pursuant to which the Company may offer and sell, from time to time, shares of its common stock, par value 0.50 per share, having an aggregate sales price of up to 25 million (subject to certain limitations at any time our public float remains under 75 million), through or to A.G.P as the Company s sales agent or as principal. Sales of our common stock under the ATM, if any, will be made by any methods deemed to be at the market offerings as defined in Rule 415(a)(4) under the Securities Act, including sales made directly on the NYSE American, on any other existing trading market for our Common Stock, or to or through a market maker. Shares of common stock 
 55 

sold under the ATM are offered pursuant to the Company s Registration Statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-254365), filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 16, 2021, and declared effective on March 26, 2021 (the "Registration Statement ), and the prospectus dated March 26, 2021, included in the Registration Statement. 
 
 The sale of shares under the ATM began in May 2021 and as of September 30, 2021, the Company sold 1,167,987 shares of common stock resulting in net proceeds of 3,784,000 after commissions and fees of 123,000. 
 
 Going Concern 
 
 Our ability to sustain our business in the future will depend on the sufficiency of our cash on hand, oil and natural gas operating cash flows, which are highly sensitive to volatile oil and natural gas prices, contract drilling operating cash flows, which are subject to large changes in demand, and future land investment segment proceeds and distributions from the Kukio Resort Land Development Partnerships, the timing of which are both highly uncertain and not within Barnwell s control. A sufficient level of such cash and cash inflows are necessary to fund discretionary oil and natural gas capital expenditures, which must be economically successful to provide sufficient returns, as well as fund our non-discretionary outflows such as oil and natural gas asset retirement obligations and ongoing operating and general and administrative expenses. In addition, as discussed in the "Asset Retirement Obligation" section of "Liquidity and Capital Resources," a significant amount of funds will be required to be put on deposit with Canadian regulatory authorities to fund abandonments at the Company's oil and natural gas properties in the Manyberries area. Other sources and potential sources of funding are discussed below. 
 
 In fiscal 2020, the Company listed its corporate office on the 29th floor of a commercial office building in downtown Honolulu, Hawaii for sale and on September 30, 2021, the Company s Honolulu corporate office was sold for approximately 1,864,000, net of related costs. 
 
 On March 16, 2021, the Company initiated an at-the-market offering program ATM pursuant to which the Company may offer and sell, from time to time, shares of its common stock under price and volume guidelines set by the Company's Board of Directors and the terms and conditions described in the Registration Statement. The sale of shares under the ATM began in May 2021 and as of September 30, 2021, the Company sold 1,167,987 shares of common stock resulting in net proceeds of 3,784,000 after commissions and fees of 123,000. 
 
 In April 2021, the Company re-initiated the marketing of its non-core oil and natural gas properties in the Spirit River, Wood River, Medicine River, Kaybob, Bonanza, Balsam and Thornbury areas for sale. On July 8 2021, Barnwell entered into and completed a purchase and sale agreement with an independent third party and sold its interests in certain natural gas and oil properties located in the Spirit River area of Alberta, Canada. The sales price per the agreement was adjusted for customary purchase price adjustments to 1,047,000 in order to, among other things, reflect an economic effective closing date of sale of July 8, 2021. From Barnwell's net proceeds, 526,000 was withheld for remittance by the buyers to the Canada Revenue Agency for potential amounts due for Barnwell s Canadian income taxes related to the sale. Negotiations regarding the potential sales of other non-core oil and natural gas properties is ongoing, however there is no assurance that the sale of any of the other non-core properties will occur. 
 
 We have experienced a trend of losses and negative operating cash flows in three of the last four years. During fiscal 2020 and 2021, continuing uncertainties regarding the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business and the sufficiency of our cash balances and future cash inflows as described 
 56 

above raised substantial doubt about our ability to meet our estimated cash outflows or continue as a going concern. However, due to the 3,784,000 of net proceeds raised by the ATM through September 30, 2021, the proceeds received from the sale of the Company's corporate office and its interests in certain natural gas and oil properties in the Spirit River area, as well as the 7,156,000 of net cash inflows in the year ended September 30, 2021 from land segment percentage of sales proceeds and distributions from the Kukio Resort Land Development Partnerships, substantial doubt about our ability to meet our estimated cash outflows or continue as a going concern for one year from the date of the filing of this report has been overcome. 
 
 NYSE American Continued Listing Standard 
 
 On January 13, 2020, the Company received notice from the NYSE American that the Company was not in compliance with Section 1003(a)(i) and Section 1003(a)(ii) of the NYSE American Company Guide (the Guide ), which respectively require an issuer to have (i) stockholders equity of 2.0 million or more if such issuer reported losses from continuing operations and/or net losses in two of its three most recent fiscal years and (ii) stockholders equity of 4.0 million or more if such issuer reported losses from continuing operations and/or net losses in three of its four most recent fiscal years, since we reported stockholders equity of 1.2 million as of September 30, 2019 and net losses in three of the last four most recent fiscal years then ended, and that the Company s common stock could be at risk of being delisted. 
 
 In accordance with the NYSE American s policies and procedures, we subsequently submitted a plan (the Plan to the NYSE American detailing the steps we planned to take to raise our stockholders equity above 4.0 million and regain compliance with Section 1003(a)(i) and Section 1003(a)(ii) of the Guide. On April 2, 2020, the NYSE American notified the Company that it accepted the Plan and granted the Company an extension for its continued listing until July 13, 2021. 
 
 On July 13, 2021, the Company filed a Form 8-K report with the Securities and Exchange Commission announcing that the Company s pro forma stockholders equity (unaudited) as of July 13, 2021 was projected to be above the 4.0 million required to comply with Section 1003(a)(i) and Section 1003(a)(ii) of the Guide. Accordingly, in a letter dated July 14, 2021, the NYSE American determined the Company had resolved the continued listing deficiency with respect to Section 1003(a)(i) and Section 1003(a)(ii) of the Guide and notified the Company that it had successfully regained compliance with the NYSE American continued listing standards. 
 
 Oil and Natural Gas Capital Expenditures 
 
 Barnwell s oil and natural gas capital expenditures, including accrued capital expenditures and acquisitions of oil and natural gas properties and excluding additions and revisions to estimated asset retirement obligations, decreased 934,000 from 3,151,000 in fiscal 2020 to 2,217,000 in fiscal 2021. 
 
 The Company participated in the drilling of seven gross (0.20 net) non-operated wells in Oklahoma during the year ended September 30, 2021. Capital expenditures incurred by the Company for these Oklahoma wells totaled 1,178,000 for the year ended September 30, 2021. One gross (0.04 net) well was completed and the well began flowback production in late May 2021 and the Company s share of net production, after royalties, from this well was 1,000 barrels of oil, 4,000 MCF of natural gas and 1,000 barrels of natural gas liquids through September 30, 2021. The remaining six gross (0.16 net) wells were all producing in October 2021. 
 
 57 

The Company did not drill or participate in the drilling of wells in Canada during the year ended September 30, 2021. Drilling opportunities in the Company's core Twining area are being investigated for potential investment in the forthcoming months. 
 
 Oil and Natural Gas Property Acquisitions and Dispositions 
 
 Dispositions 
 
 In April 2021, Barnwell entered into a purchase and sale agreement with an independent third party and sold its interests in properties located in the Hillsdown area of Alberta, Canada. The sales price per the agreement was adjusted for customary purchase price adjustments to 132,000 in order to, among other things, reflect an economic effective date of October 1, 2020. 72,000 of the sales proceeds was withheld by the buyers for potential amounts due for Barnwell s Canadian income taxes related to the sale. The final determination of the customary adjustments to the purchase price has not yet been made, however it is not expected to result in a material adjustment. The proceeds were credited to the full cost pool, with no gain or loss recognized, as the sale did not result in a significant alteration of the relationship between capitalized costs and proved reserves. 
 
 In April 2021, the Company re-initiated the marketing of its non-core oil and natural gas properties in the Spirit River, Wood River, Medicine River, Kaybob, Bonanza, Balsam and Thornbury areas for sale. On July 8, 2021, Barnwell entered into and completed a purchase and sale agreement with an independent third party and sold its interests in certain natural gas and oil properties located in the Spirit River area of Alberta, Canada. The sales price per the agreement was adjusted for customary purchase price adjustments to 1,047,000 in order to, among other things, reflect an economic effective closing date of sale of July 8, 2021. From Barnwell's net proceeds, 526,000 was withheld for remittance by the buyers to the Canada Revenue Agency for potential amounts due for Barnwell s Canadian income taxes related to the sale. 
 
 The difference in the relationship between capitalized costs and proved reserves of the Spirit River properties sold as compared to the properties retained by Barnwell was significant as there was a 93 difference in capitalized costs divided by proved reserves if the gain was recorded versus the gain being credited against the full-cost pool. Accordingly, Barnwell recorded a gain on the sale of Spirit River of 818,000 in the year ended September 30, 2021 in accordance with the guidance in Rule 4-10(c)(6)(i) of Regulation S-X of the rules and regulations of the SEC, which requires an allocation of capitalized costs to the reserves sold and reserves retained on the basis of the relative fair values of the properties as there was a substantial economic difference between the properties sold and those retained. Also included in the gain calculation were asset retirement obligations of 77,000 assumed by the purchaser. 
 
 Negotiations regarding the potential sales of other non-core oil and natural gas properties is ongoing, however there is no assurance that the sale of any of the other non-core properties will occur. 
 
 In the quarter ended December 31, 2019, Barnwell entered into a purchase and sale agreement with an independent third party and sold its interests in properties located in the Progress area of Alberta, Canada. The sales price per the agreement was adjusted for customary purchase price adjustments to 594,000 in order to, among other things, reflect an economic effective date of October 1, 2019. The proceeds were credited to the full cost pool, with no gain or loss recognized, as the sale did not result in a significant alteration of the relationship between capitalized costs and proved reserves. 
 
 58 

Acquisitions 
 
 In April 2021, Barnwell acquired additional working interests in oil and natural gas properties located in the Twining area of Alberta, Canada for cash consideration of 348,000. The purchase price per the agreement was adjusted for customary purchase price adjustments to reflect the economic activity from the effective date to the closing date. The final determination of the customary adjustments to the purchase price has not yet been made, however it is not expected to result in a material adjustment. 
 
 There were no significant amounts paid for oil and natural gas property acquisitions during the year ended September 30, 2020. 
 
 Asset Retirement Obligation 
 
 In September 2019, the AER issued an abandonment/closure order for all wells and facilities in the Manyberries area which had been largely operated by LGX, an operating company that went into receivership in 2016. The estimated asset retirement obligation for the Company's interest in the wells and facilities in the Manyberries area is included in Asset retirement obligation in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Many 100 LGX-owned wells are to be reclaimed by the OWA. However, as next largest interest holder in 82 of the wells and 7 facilities formerly operated by LGX, averaging 11 , the Company is required to take care and custody of those properties and to coordinate their closure. This area has unique access issues as a result of an Emergency Protection Order to protect the Sage Grouse under the Canadian Government s Species at Risk Act. Access is limited to a window of mid-September to the end of November each year. 
 
 Recently, the OWA created a WIP program for specific areas where there are a significant number of orphaned wells to abandon. The OWA has the ability and expertise to abandon wells using its internal resources and network of service providers resulting in efficiencies that companies such as Barnwell, would not be able to obtain on its own. Under the WIP program, the Company would be required to provide payment for only Barnwell s working interest share, however, all WIP s would have to participate in the program for the OWA to begin its work. In March 2021, the Company was notified by the OWA that Barnwell s Manyberries wells were confirmed to be in the WIP program. 
 
 Under the new agreement with the OWA, the Company is required to pay the abandonment and reclamation costs in advance through a cash deposit. The total cash deposit amount was calculated to be approximately 1,525,000 and the Company paid 888,000 of the total deposit in July and August 2021 and will need to pay the remaining balance of 637,000 by August 2022. The Company revised its Manyberries ARO liability based on the OWA s revised abandonment and reclamation estimates, which resulted in an increase of approximately 213,000 in the current year. The increase in the ARO liability was a result of higher reclamation and remediation costs than anticipated, partially offset by lower abandonment estimates. Based on a review of the details of the cash deposit calculation provided by the OWA, which includes amounts added for possible contingencies, the Company believes the required cash deposit amount by the OWA is higher than the actual costs of the asset retirement obligation for the Manyberries wells and that any excess of the deposit over actual asset retirement costs for the first phase of the work would be credited toward the second phase of the work. A remaining excess deposit, if any, would ultimately be refunded to the Company upon completion of all of the work.

ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA 

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 

To the Board of Stockholders and Board of Directors of 
 Barnwell Industries, Inc. 
 
 Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements 
 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Barnwell Industries, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of September 30, 2021 and 2020, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), equity (deficit), and cash flows for the years then ended, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements ). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of September 30, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
 
 Basis for Opinion 
 
 These financial statements are the responsibility of the entity s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) ("PCAOB") and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 
 
 Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 
 Critical Audit Matters 
 
 The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters 
 61 

does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. 
 
 Estimation of Proved Reserves Impacting the Recognition and Valuation of Depletion Expense and Impairment and Oil and Gas Properties 
 
 Critical Audit Matter Description 
 As described in Note 1 to the financial statements, the Company accounts for its oil and gas properties using the full cost method of accounting which requires management to make estimates of proved reserve volumes and future revenues and expenses to calculate depletion expense and measure its oil and gas properties for potential impairment. To estimate the volume of proved reserves and future revenues, management makes significant estimates and assumptions, including forecasting the production decline rate of producing properties and forecasting the timing and volume of production associated with the Company s development plan for proved undeveloped properties. In addition, the estimation of proved reserves is also impacted by management s judgments and estimates regarding the financial performance of wells associated with proved reserves to determine if wells are expected, with reasonable certainty, to be economical under the appropriate pricing assumptions required in the estimation of depletion expense and potential impairment measurements. We identified the estimation of proved reserves of oil and gas properties, due to its impact on depletion expense and impairment evaluation, as a critical audit matter. 
 
 The principal consideration for our determination that the estimation of proved reserves is a critical audit matter is that changes in certain inputs and assumptions, which require a high degree of subjectivity necessary to estimate the volume and future revenues of the Company s proved reserves could have a significant impact on the measurement of depletion expense or the impairment assessment. In turn, auditing those inputs and assumptions required subjective and complex auditor judgement. 
 
 How the Critical Audit Matter was Addressed in the Audit 
 We obtained an understanding of the design and implementation of management s controls and our audit procedures related to the estimation of proved reserves included the following, among others. 
 
 We evaluated the level of knowledge, skill, and ability of the Company s reservoir engineering specialists and their relationship to the Company, made inquiries of those reservoir engineers regarding the process followed and judgments made to estimate the Company s proved reserve volumes, and read the reserve report prepared by the Company s specialists. 
 To the extent key, sensitive inputs and assumptions used to determine proved reserve volumes and other cash flow inputs and assumptions are derived from Company s accounting records, such as commodity pricing, historical pricing differentials, operating costs, estimated capital costs and working and net revenue interests, we tested management s process for determining the assumptions, including examining the underlying support, on a sample basis. Specifically, our audit procedures involved testing management s assumptions as follows: 
 
 Compared the estimated pricing differentials used in the reserve report to realized prices related to revenue transactions recorded in the current year and examined contractual support for the pricing differentials; 
 Evaluated the models used to estimate the operating costs at year-end compared to historical operating costs; 
 62 

Compared the models used to determine the future capital expenditures and compared estimated future capital expenditures used in the reserve report to amounts expended for recently drilled and completed wells with similar locations; 
 Evaluated the working and net revenue interests used in the reserve report by inspecting a sample of ownership interests, historical pricing differentials, and operating costs to underlying support from the Company s accounting records; 
 Evaluated the Company s evidence supporting the amount of proved undeveloped properties reflected in the reserve report by examining support for the Company s or the operator s ability and intent to develop the proved undeveloped properties; 
 Applied analytical procedures to the reserve report by comparing to historical actual results and to the prior year reserve report. 
 
 Revenue Recognition Based on the Percentage of Completion Method 
 
 Critical Audit Matter Description 
 As described further in Note 1 to the financial statements, revenues derived from contract drilling contracts are recognized over time, as performance obligations are satisfied, due to the continuous transfer of control to the customer, using the percentage-of-completion method of accounting, based primarily on contract cost incurred to date compared to total estimated contract cost. Revenue recognition under this method is judgmental, particularly on lump-sum contracts, as it requires the Company to prepare estimates of total contract revenue and total contract costs, including costs to complete in-process contracts. 
 
 Auditing the Company s estimates or total contract revenue and costs used to recognize revenue on contract drilling contracts involved significant auditor judgment, as it required the evaluation of subjective factors such as assumptions related to project schedule and completion, forecasted labor, and material and subcontract costs. These assumptions involved significant management judgment, which affects the measurement of revenue recognized by the Company. 
 
 How the Critical Audit Matter was Addressed in the Audit 
 We obtained an understanding of the design and implementation of management s controls and our audit procedures related to the estimation of proved reserves included the following, among others. 
 
 We obtained an understanding of the Company s estimation process that affected revenue recognized on engineering and construction contracts. This included controls over management s monitoring and review of project costs, including the Company s procedures to validate the completeness and accuracy of data used to determine the estimates. 
 We selected a sample of projects and, among other procedures, obtained and inspected the contract agreements, amendments and change orders to test the existence of customer arrangements and understand the scope of pricing of the related contracts; 
 Evaluated the Company s estimated revenue and costs to complete by obtaining and analyzing supporting documentation of management s estimates of variable consideration and contract costs; 
 Compared contract profitability estimates in the current year to historical estimates and actual performance. 
 
 Calculation of Gain Associated with Sale of Oil and Gas Properties 
 
 Critical Audit Matter Description 
 As described further in Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company recorded a gain to the statement of operations from sale of certain oil and gas properties. Determination of the accounting for 
 63 

this transaction is challenging as it requires the Company to prepare significant assumptions and estimates regarding the associated fair value of the oil and gas reserves sold as compared to costs capitalized. The fair value estimate allows the Company to determine if the sale of the oil and gas assets are significant to the total full cost pool to record a gain on sale under the full cost method of accounting. 
 
 Auditing the Company s estimates and assumptions used to calculate the fair value of the oil and gas reserves used to determine the relationship between capitalized costs and proved reserves of the Spirit River properties sold as compared to the properties retained by the Company, as it required the evaluation of the significant inputs and assumptions used in the reserve reports prepared by a third party reserve engineer (the Company s specialist). Further, such fair values determined by the Company s specialist also determined the gain calculation under the full cost method of accounting used by the Company. 
 
 How the Critical Audit Matter was Addressed in the Audit 
 We obtained an understanding of the design and implementation of management s controls and our audit procedures related to the fair value of oil and gas reserves sold in relationship with the capitalized costs utilized in the calculation of the gain associated with the sale of oil and gas properties included the following: 
 
 We evaluated the level of knowledge, skill, and ability of the Company s reservoir engineering specialists and their relationship to the Company, made inquiries of those reservoir engineers regarding the process followed and judgments made to estimate the Company s proved reserve volumes, and read the reserve report prepared by the Company s specialists. 
 Utilized the support of auditor s specialists to recalculate independently of reserve engineer the fair value of oil and gas reserves sold vs. retained based on reserve information provided by the Company s through their third party reserve engineer; 
 We evaluated management s application of gain accounting under full cost method related to the sale of the oil and gas properties to determine proper treatment was applied. 
 Compared the calculation inputs for the gain recorded to the purchase and sale agreement.

The final determination of the customary adjustments to the purchase price has not yet been made, however it is not expected to result in a material adjustment.

From Barnwell's net proceeds, was withheld for remittance by the buyers to the Canada Revenue Agency for potential amounts due for Barnwell s Canadian income taxes related to the sale. 
 
 The difference in the relationship between capitalized costs and proved reserves of the Spirit River properties sold as compared to the properties retained by Barnwell was significant as there was a difference in capitalized costs divided by proved reserves if the gain was recorded versus the gain being credited against the full-cost pool. Accordingly, Barnwell recorded a gain on the sale of Spirit River of in the year ended September 30, 2021 in accordance with the guidance in Rule 4-10(c)(6)(i) of Regulation S-X of the rules and regulations of the SEC, which requires an allocation of capitalized costs to the reserves sold and reserves retained on the basis of the relative fair values of the properties as there was a substantial economic difference between the properties sold and those retained. Also included in the gain calculation were asset retirement obligations of assumed by the purchaser.

in order to, among other things, reflect an economic effective date of October 1, 2019. The proceeds were credited to the full cost pool, with no gain or loss recognized, as the sale did not result in a significant alteration of the relationship between capitalized costs and proved reserves.

 Asset retirement obligations were reduced by and , in fiscal 2021 and 2020, respectively, for those obligations that were assumed by purchasers of Barnwell's oil and natural gas properties. Asset retirement obligations also increased by in fiscal 2021 as compared to a reduction of in fiscal 2020 primarily due to upward revisions from acceleration in the estimated timing of future abandonments as a result of changes in the estimated economic life of certain wells and changes in management's discretionary timing of abandonment projects due to an increase in estimated funds available as well as an increase in the estimated cost of abandonments at the Manyberries area, as further discussed below. Asset retirement obligations increased by and in fiscal 2021 and 2020, respectively, due primarily to our acquisitions (see Note 7 for additional details). The asset retirement obligation reflects the estimated present value of the amount of dismantlement, removal, site reclamation, and similar activities associated with Barnwell's oil and natural gas properties. Barnwell estimates the ultimate productive life of the properties, a credit-adjusted risk-free rate, and an inflation factor in order to determine the current present value of this obligation. The credit-adjusted risk-free rate for the entire asset retirement obligation is a blended rate which ranges from to . 
 
 In September 2019, the AER issued an abandonment/closure order for all wells and facilities in the Manyberries area which had been largely operated by LGX, an operating company that went into receivership in 2016. The estimated asset retirement obligation for the Company's interest in the wells and facilities in the Manyberries area is included in Asset retirement obligation in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
 
 Recently, the OWA created a WIP program for specific areas where there are a significant number of orphaned wells to abandon. The OWA has the ability and expertise to abandon wells using its internal resources and network of service providers resulting in efficiencies that companies such as Barnwell, would not be able to obtain on its own. Under the WIP program, the Company would be required to provide payment for only Barnwell s working interest share, however, all WIP s would have to participate in the program for the OWA to begin its work. In March 2021, the Company was notified by the OWA that Barnwell s Manyberries wells were confirmed to be in the WIP program. 
 
 Under the new agreement with the OWA, the Company is required to pay the abandonment and reclamation costs in advance through a cash deposit. The total cash deposit amount was calculated to be approximately and the Company paid of the total deposit in July and August 2021 
 88 

by August 2022. The deposit balance at September 30, 2021, less draw-downs by the OWA for OWA-performed abandonments, was and is reflected in "Other current assets" in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of September 30, 2021. There is no right of offset between the deposit with the OWA and the Company's ARO liability balance. The Company revised its Manyberries ARO liability based on the OWA s revised abandonment and reclamation estimates, which resulted in an increase of approximately in the current year. The increase in the ARO liability was a result of higher reclamation and remediation costs than anticipated, partially offset by lower abandonment estimates. A remaining excess deposit, if any, would ultimately be refunded to the Company upon completion of all of the work.

 years average earnings. Barnwell s funding policy is intended to provide for both benefits attributed to service to date and for those expected to be earned in the future. In addition, Barnwell sponsors a Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan SERP ), a noncontributory supplemental retirement benefit plan which covers certain current and former employees of Barnwell for amounts exceeding the limits allowed under the Pension Plan, and previously sponsored a post-retirement medical insurance benefits plan Post-retirement Medical covering officers of Barnwell Industries, Inc., the parent company, who have attained at least years of service of which at least years were at the position of Vice President or higher, their spouses and qualifying dependents. 
 
 In December 2019, the Company s Board of Directors approved a resolution to freeze all future benefit accruals for all participants under the Company s Pension Plan and SERP effective December 31, 2019. Consequently, current participants in the Pension Plan and SERP no longer accrue new benefits under the plans and new employees of the Company are no longer eligible to enter the Pension Plan and SERP as participants after December 31, 2019. The freezing of the Pension Plan and SERP triggered a curtailment which required a remeasurement of the projected benefit obligations of the Pension Plan and SERP and resulted in a reduction in unrecognized pension benefit costs that were previously included in accumulated other comprehensive loss, with a corresponding curtailment gain in other comprehensive income which was recorded during the year ended September 30, 2020. 
 
 In June 2021, the Company terminated its Post-retirement Medical plan effective June 4, 2021. Pursuant to the Post-retirement Medical plan document, the Company, as the sponsor of the Post-retirement Medical plan, had the right to terminate the plan within sixty days notice to each participant and the plan may be terminated by the resolution of the Board of the Directors of the Company. Further, under the terms of the plan document, the participants in the Post-retirement Medical plan were not entitled to any unpaid vested benefits thereunder upon termination of the plan. The Post-retirement Medical plan was an unfunded plan and the Company funded benefits when payments were made. As a result of the plan termination, the Company recognized a non-cash gain of during the year ended September 30, 2021.

 Plan Assets 
 
 Management communicates periodically with its professional investment advisors to establish investment policies, direct investments and select investment options. The overall investment objective of the Pension Plan is to attain a diversified combination of investments that provides long-term growth in the assets of the plan to fund future benefit obligations while managing risk in order to meet current benefit obligations. Generally, interest and dividends received provide cash flows to fund current benefit obligations. Longer-term obligations are generally estimated to be provided for by growth in equity securities. The Company s investment policy permits investments in a diversified mix of U.S. and international equities, fixed income securities and cash equivalents. 
 
 Barnwell s investments in fixed income securities include corporate bonds, preferred securities, and fixed income exchange-traded funds. The Company s investments in equity securities primarily include domestic and international large-cap companies, as well as, domestic and international equity securities exchange-traded funds.

 Consolidated taxes do not bear a customary relationship to pretax results due primarily to the fact that the Company is taxed separately in Canada based on Canadian source operations and in the U.S. based on consolidated operations, and essentially all deferred tax assets, net of relevant offsetting deferred tax liabilities, are not estimated to have a future benefit as tax credits or deductions. Income from our non-controlling interest in the Kukio Resort Land Development Partnerships is treated as non-unitary for state of Hawaii unitary filing purposes, thus unitary Hawaii losses provide limited sheltering of such non-unitary income. Income from our investment in the Oklahoma oil venture is 100 allocable to Oklahoma, and therefore, receives no benefit from consolidated or unitary losses. 
 On June 28, 2019, the Canadian province of Alberta enacted legislation that decreased the provincial general corporate tax rate from 12 to 11 effective July 1, 2019, with further 1 rate reductions on January 1 of every year until the provincial general corporate tax rate is 8 on January 1, 2022, bringing Barnwell of Canada s and Octavian Oil s total Canadian statutory tax rates from 30.65 and 27.00 , respectively, to 29.70 and 26.00 , respectively, effective July 1, 2019 and to 26.85 and 23.00 , respectively, effective January 1, 2022. On June 29, 2020, the Government of Alberta introduced Alberta s Recovery Plan which will, among other things, reduce Alberta s general corporate income tax rate to 8 (from 10 effective July 1, 2020. This reduction was enacted in the quarter ended December

 The total valuation allowance decreased for the year ended September 30, 2021. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in the U.S. federal tax law valuation allowance related to U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards, a decrease in the U.S. federal tax law valuation allowance related to foreign tax credit carryovers, and a decrease in the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets under Canadian law related to property and equipment accumulated book depletion in excess of tax and Canadian jurisdiction net operating loss carryforwards that may not be realizable. Of the total net decrease in the valuation allowance for fiscal 2021, was recognized as an income tax benefit and was credited to accumulated other comprehensive loss.

 At September 30, 2021, Barnwell had U.S. federal foreign tax credit carryovers, U.S. federal net operating loss carryovers, U.S. state net operating loss carryovers and Canadian net operating loss carryovers totaling , , and , respectively. All four items were fully offset by valuation allowances at September 30, 2021, except for a portion of Hawaii NOLs which is expected to shelter a portion of the reversal of the Company s Hawaii non-unitary taxable temporary difference related to its investment in Hawaii land development partnerships. The U.S. federal net operating loss carryovers generated through September 30, 2018 expire in fiscal years 2032-2038, the U.S. state unitary net operating loss carryovers generated through September 30, 2017 expire in fiscal years 2033-2037, the Canadian net operating loss carryovers expire in fiscal years 2037-2041, and the foreign tax credit carryovers expire in fiscal years 2022-2025. The U.S. federal net operating loss carryovers generated in the years ended September 30, 2021, 2020 and 2019 and the U.S. state net operating loss carryovers generated in the years ended September 30, 2021, 2020, 2019 and 2018 have no expiry, however utilization of the U.S. state net operating loss carryovers generated in fiscal 2018 and future years are limited to 80 of taxable income. 
 FASB ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes, prescribes a threshold for recognizing the financial statement effects of a tax position when it is more likely than not, based on the technical merits, that the position will be sustained upon examination by a taxing authority.

Contract assets Contract liabilities 
 
 Accounts receivables from contracts with customers are included in Accounts and other receivables, net of allowance for doubtful accounts, and contract assets, which includes costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings and retainage, are included in Other current assets. Contract liabilities, which includes billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings are included in Other current liabilities in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
 
 Retainage, included in contract assets, represents amounts due from customers, but where payments are withheld contractually until certain construction milestones are met. Amounts retained typically range from to of the total invoice, up to contractually-specified maximums. The Company classifies as a current asset those retainages that are expected to be collected in the next twelve months. 
 
 Contract assets represent the Company s rights to consideration in exchange for services transferred to a customer that have not been billed as of the reporting date. The Company s rights are generally unconditional at the time its performance obligations are satisfied. 
 
 When the Company receives consideration, or such consideration is unconditionally due, from a customer prior to transferring goods or services to the customer under the terms of a sales contract, the Company records deferred revenue, which represents a contract liability. Such deferred revenue typically results from billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts. As of September 30, 2021 and 2020, the Company had and , respectively, included in Other current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets for those performance obligations expected to be completed in the next twelve months. 
 
 During the years ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, the amount of revenue recognized that was previously included in contract liabilities as of the beginning of the respective period was and , respectively. 
 
 Contracts are sometimes modified for a change in scope or other requirements. The Company considers contract modifications to exist when the modification either creates new or changes the existing enforceable rights and obligations. Most of the Company s contract modifications are for goods and services that are not distinct from the existing performance obligations. The effect of a contract modification on the transaction price, and the measure of progress for the performance obligation to which it relates, is recognized as an adjustment to revenue (either as an increase or decrease) on a cumulative catchup basis.

of the remaining performance obligation of is expected to be recognized in the next twelve months and the remaining, thereafter. 
 
 Contract Fulfillment Costs 
 
 Preconstruction costs, which include costs such as set-up and mobilization, are capitalized and allocated across all performance obligations and deferred and amortized over the contract term on a progress towards completion basis. As of September 30, 2021 and 2020, the Company had and , respectively, in unamortized preconstruction costs related to contracts that were not completed. During the years ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, the amortization of preconstruction costs related to contracts was and , respectively. These amounts have been included in Contract drilling operating costs and expenses in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. Additionally, impairment charges in connection with the Company s preconstruction costs were recorded during the years ended September 30, 2021 and 2020. 
 
 Water Well Re-drill 
 
 In the quarter ended December 31, 2019, the Company experienced the failure of a hole opener which broke apart leaving pieces in the bottom of a water well being drilled in Hawaii. Efforts to remove the items from the well were unsuccessful through the quarter ended March 31, 2020 and subsequently the Company determined that the well should be abandoned and a new well drilled at no incremental cost to the customer as per the terms of the contract. Accordingly, all the costs to drill and abandon the first well, which are all wasted costs, were excluded from the measurement of progress toward contract completion and all such costs were fully accrued in the quarter ended March 31, 2020, as this contract was determined to be a loss job. In September 2020, while making progress towards the drilling of a replacement well in different location, the drill string twisted off and became lodged in the well borehole, which required a stoppage of drilling and the need to dislodge and retrieve the broken drill string. Accordingly, the estimated total rework costs to remediate the situation was accrued at September 30, 2020. In January 2021, the broken drill string was retrieved from the well borehole and drilling of the replacement well recommenced.

 The lease payments for the Lot 4C leasehold land were subject to renegotiation as of January 1, 2006. Per the lease agreement, the lease payments will remain unchanged pending an appraisal, whereupon the lease rent could be adjusted to fair market value. Barnwell does not know the amount of the new lease payments which could be effective upon performance of the appraisal; they may remain unchanged or increase, and Barnwell currently expects the adjustment, if any, to not be material. The future lease payment disclosures above assume the minimum lease payments for leasehold land in effect at December 31, 2005 remain unchanged through December 2025, the end of the lease term.

 Environmental Matters 
 
 Because of the inherent uncertainties associated with environmental assessment and remediation activities, future expenses to remediate sites identified in the future, if any, could be incurred. Barnwell's management is not currently aware of any significant environmental contingent liabilities requiring disclosure or accrual. 
 
 Legal and Regulatory Matters 
 
 Barnwell is routinely involved in disputes with third parties that occasionally require litigation. In addition, Barnwell is required to maintain compliance with all current governmental controls and regulations in the ordinary course of business. Barnwell s management is not aware of any claims or litigation involving Barnwell that are likely to have a material adverse effect on its results of operations, financial position or liquidity. 
 
 In the year ended September 30, 2019, of the water wells drilled by the contract drilling segment for customer were determined to not meet the contract specifications for plumbness. Subsequently, in the quarter ended March 31, 2020, the Company executed a separate warranty 
 109 

of the wells that did not meet plumbness. Under the terms of the agreement, if the lack of plumbness is determined to be the cause of a pump failure within the warranty period, the Company would be obligated to replace the pump at no cost to the customer. If the Company is unable to replace the pump using industry-standard methods, or if there are or more pump failures attributable to lack of plumbness within the warranty period, the Company would be obligated to drill a new well at no cost to the customer. Negotiations with the customer are currently ongoing for the other well that the customer claims did not meet plumbness despite the fact that the independent consulting engineer for the job concluded that the most recent plumbness test, completed after the well was cased with casing cemented into place as per the contract, showed that the well meets the plumbness specifications of the contract. Management believes the degrees of deviation for both wells are not impactful to the performance of the submersible pumps that will be installed in those wells. Accordingly, no accruals have been recorded as of September 30, 2021 as there is no probable or estimable contingent liability. 
 
 In July 2020, the Staff of the Commission circulated a draft of a proposed recommendation to the Commission under which the Company, the water utility, the water utility's independent hydrologist firm and the owner of the land on which the aforementioned water wells were drilled would be assessed penalty fines because each of the wells were calculated to have been drilled beyond the depth permitted by the permit. The wells were drilled to a depth to penetrate certain layers of impermeable rock necessary to access the aquifer at the instructions and on the advice of the hydrologist hired by the owner of the well. The Company s share of the proposed penalties and fines was originally calculated to approximately . Subsequently, the Staff of the Commission acknowledged that one well had not been drilled to a depth beyond its permitted depth and the fines on that well were eliminated. Additionally, the fines applicable to the depth of the second well were dropped in lieu of the parties entering into an agreement to perform a water quality study and repurpose a current well into a monitoring well. Accordingly, the Company recorded a contingent liability of approximately at September 30, 2020 and no subsequent revision to the accrual has been recorded as of September 30, 2021. 
 
 Other Matters 
 
 Barnwell is obligated to pay Nearco Enterprises Ltd. , net of non-controlling interests' share, of Kaupulehu Developments gross receipts from real estate transactions. The fees represent compensation for promotion and marketing of Kaupulehu Developments property and were determined based on the estimated fair value of such services. These fees are included in general and administrative expenses. 
 
 Barnwell is obligated to pay its external real estate legal counsel , net of non-controlling interests' share, of all Increment II payments received by Kaupulehu Developments for services provided by its external real estate legal counsel in the negotiation and closing of the Increment II transaction.

(E) Standardized Measure, Including Year-to-Year Changes Therein, of Estimated Discounted Future Net Cash Flows 
 
 The following tables utilize reserve and production data estimated by independent petroleum reserve engineers. The information may be useful for certain comparison purposes but should not be solely relied upon in evaluating Barnwell or its performance. Moreover, the projections should not be construed as realistic estimates of future cash flows, nor should the standardized measure be viewed as representing current value. Additionally, proved oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids reserves located in the United States are not significant and are therefore not included in the tables below. 
 
 The estimated future cash flows at September 30, 2021 and 2020 were based on average sales prices in effect on the first day of the month for the preceding twelve month period in accordance with SEC Release No. 33-8995. The future production and development costs represent the estimated future expenditures that we will incur to develop and produce the proved reserves, assuming continuation of existing economic conditions. The future income tax expenses were computed by applying statutory income tax rates in existence at September 30, 2021 and 2020 to the future pre-tax net cash flows relating to proved reserves, net of the tax basis of the properties involved.

 Management s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
 Barnwell s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for Barnwell, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Under the supervision and with the participation of Barnwell s management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, Barnwell conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting using criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in the report entitled Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) (the COSO Framework ). Based on this evaluation under the COSO Framework, management concluded that its internal control over financial reporting was effective as of September 30, 2021. 
 
 This Annual Report on Form 10-K does not include an attestation report of our independent registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Pursuant to Item 308(b) of Regulation S-K, management s report is not subject to attestation by our independent registered public accounting firm because the Company is neither an accelerated filer nor a large accelerated filer as those terms are defined by the SEC. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
 There was no change in Barnwell s internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2021 that materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, Barnwell s internal control over financial reporting.

Barnwell of Canada, Limited 
 Suite 2410, 500 4th Avenue SW 
 Calgary, Alberta 
 T2P 2V6 
 
 Re Evaluation of the Oil and Gas Properties of 
 Barnwell of Canada, Limited and Octavian Oil Ltd. 

Dear Sirs 
 
 As requested, an evaluation has been made of all of the crude oil and natural gas assets of Barnwell of Canada, Limited and Octavian Oil Ltd., hereinafter referred to as the Company. The properties evaluated are located in the Canadian provinces of Alberta and British Columbia. The effective date of the reserve estimates presented in this report is September 30, 2021. The purpose of this evaluation and report is to fulfill Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) reporting requirements. 
 
 All Company assets were evaluated in full detail. Individual property evaluations were prepared in the context of belonging to a larger portfolio of properties. Due to the principal of aggregation of reserves, the total portfolio reserves estimate carries a higher degree of confidence than the estimates for the individual properties. 
 
 This evaluation is based in part on prices, currency exchange rates and estimates which, in future, may differ materially from the forecasts utilized herein. In addition, changes in government policy and regulation may result in higher (or lower) royalties and taxes and the change may be material therefore, the present values of revenues documented in this report do not necessarily represent the fair market value of the reserves evaluated. The reserve estimates presented in this report are considered reasonable as of the effective date of the report given the quality and quantity of data available however, they should be accepted with the understanding that reservoir performance subsequent to the date of these estimates may necessitate revision, which may be material. 

Barnwell of Canada, Limited plus Octavian Oil Ltd. 
 Summary of Net Reserves Constant Prices and Costs 

Net Remaining Reserves Crude Oil (Stb) NGL + Cond. (Stb) Market Gas (Mcf) Proved Producing 487,600 91,000 2,693,300 Proved Non-Producing 49,400 7,600 219,800 Proved Undeveloped 4,200 000 000 Total Proved 541,200 98,600 2,913,100 

Constant prices were prepared based on posted prices of crude oil and natural gas, and natural gas liquids using a 12 month unweighted arithmetic average closing price of each commodity on the 1st day of each month from October 1, 2020 through September 1, 2021 during the fiscal year. This report has been prepared using constant prices and costs and conforms to our understanding of the SEC s guidelines and applicable financial accounting rules. 
 
 All prices used in the evaluation have been adjusted from posted prices for applicable quality, heating value and transportation considerations. The weighted average prices, after applicable adjustments, over the life of the properties used in the evaluation were US 49.73 barrel of oil, US 2.23 per Mcf of gas, US 36.07 per barrel of condensate and natural gas liquids. 
 
 During the course of the evaluation, the Company provided InSite Petroleum Consultants Ltd. InSite personnel with basic information including land data, well information, geological information, reservoir studies, estimates of on-stream dates, contract details, operating cost data, capital budget forecasts, operating statements and other financial data and future operating plans. Additional engineering, geological or economic data used in the preparation of this report were obtained from public records, other operators and from InSite non-confidential files. InSite encountered no indications that the data was incomplete or inaccurate. Should evidence become available in the future suggesting that the data was incomplete or inaccurate, InSite reserves the right to revise the estimates based on new data. Similarly, the performance of the producing entities subsequent to the effective date of this report may necessitate upward or downward revisions to the reserve and production estimates. 
 
 In conducting our reserve analysis, proved reserve volumes were determined by volumetric, material balance, and production decline curve methods. The volumetric reserves were determined by reviewing all well logs, core, and geological data. Recovery factors were assigned after analyzing the performance of similar wells in the area. Historical well production was reviewed to determine reserves calculated by production decline curve analysis where sufficient historical data was available. The order of preference in choosing the methodology to be used was firstly production decline curve analysis or material balance where sufficient data was available for such analysis with volumetric calculations used where there was a lack of historical data. 
 
 The production and revenue forecasts for each property and the corporate cash flow summaries have not been adjusted for risk. Well abandonment, decommissioning and site reclamation costs (ADR) were included in the economic runs for all wells with reserves assigned, as wells as the ADR costs for producing wells with no reserves assigned, suspended wells and existing facilities. The ADR costs and timing were adopted from the Company s internal Asset Retirement Obligation (ARO) estimates. 
 
 The oil and gas reserves calculations and income projections upon which this report is based, were determined in accordance with generally accepted evaluation practices. InSite used all assumptions, data, methods and procedures it considered appropriate, under the circumstances, to prepare this report. 
 
 The extent and character of ownership and all factual data supplied by the Company were accepted as presented. A field inspection was not considered necessary by InSite. 

In this report, gross (or Company share) reserves are defined as the total remaining recoverable reserves owned by the Company before deduction of any royalties. Net reserves are defined as those accruing to the Company after all interests owned by others including Crown and Freehold royalties have been deducted. The reserve category definitions utilized in this report are in accordance with SEC standards and Regulation S-X. 

Yours very truly, 
 
 InSite Petroleum Consultants Ltd.
