PART I 
 
 SPECIAL NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 On one or more occasions, we may make statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K regarding our assumptions, projections, expectations, targets, intentions or beliefs about future events. All statements, other than statements of historical facts, included or incorporated by reference herein relating to management s current expectations of future financial performance, continued growth and changes in economic conditions or capital markets are forward looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. 
 Words or phrases such as anticipates, believes, estimates, expects, intends, plans, predicts, projects, targets, will likely result, hopes, will continue or similar expressions identify forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results or outcomes to differ materially from those expressed. We caution that while we make such statements in good faith and we believe such statements are based on reasonable assumptions, including without limitation, management s examination of historical operating trends, data contained in records and other data available from third parties, we cannot assure you that our projections will be achieved. Factors that may cause such differences include: economic conditions generally and in each of the markets in which we are located, the amount of sales contributed by new and existing restaurants, labor costs for our personnel, fluctuations in the cost of food products, adverse weather conditions, changes in consumer preferences and the level of competition from existing or new competitors. We have attempted to identify, in context, certain of the factors that we believe may cause actual future experience and results to differ materially from our current expectation regarding the relevant matter or subject area. 
 While we believe that our assumptions are reasonable, we caution that it is very difficult to predict the impact of known factors, and it is impossible for us to anticipate all factors that could affect our actual results. All forward-looking statements are expressly qualified in their entirety by these cautionary statements. You should evaluate all forward-looking statements made in this report in the context of the factors that could cause outcomes to differ materially from our expectations. These factors include, but are not limited to: 
 the risk associated with the continued impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our company, our employees, our customers, our partners, our industry and the economy as a whole, including the potential for a complete shutdown of our restaurants, supply chain disruptions, demonstrations, political unrest and potential damage to our res taurants; 
 the adverse impact of current and future economic conditions on our (i) operating results and financial condition, (ii) ability to comply with the terms and covenants of our debt agreements, and (iii) ability to pay or refinance our existing debt or to obtain additional financing; 
 the adverse impact of civil unrest on our (i) operating results and financial condition, (ii) ability to comply with the terms and covenants of our debt agreements, and (iii) ability to pay or refinance our existing debt or to obtain additional financing; 
 increases in wages and benefit costs, including the cost of group medical insurance; 
 our ability to open new restaurants in new and existing markets, including difficulty in finding sites and in negotiating acceptable leases; 
 vulnerability to changes in consumer preferences and economic conditions; 
 vulnerability to conditions in the cities in which we operate; 
 vulnerability to adverse weather conditions and natural disasters given the geographic concentration and real estate intensive nature of our business; 
 our ability to extend existing leases on favorable terms: 
 increases in food, beverage and supply costs, especially for seafood, shellfish, chicken and beef; 
 negative publicity, whether or not valid, and our ability to respond to and effectively manage the accelerated impact of social media; 
 concerns about food safety and quality and about food-borne illnesses; 
 3 

the reliance of the Company on the continued service of its executive officers; 
 the impact of any security breaches of confidential customer information in connection with our electronic process of credit and debit card transactions; and 
 the impact of any failure of our information technology system or any breach of our network security. 
 
 We caution you that the important factors referenced above may not contain all of the factors that are important to you. In addition, we cannot assure you that we will realize the results or developments we expect or anticipate or, even if substantially realized, that they will result in the consequences we anticipate or affect us or our operations in the ways that we expect. The forward-looking statements included in this report are made only as of the date hereof. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law. If we do update one or more forward-looking statements, no inference should be made that we will make additional updates with respect to those or other forward-looking statements. We qualify all of our forward-looking statements by these cautionary statements. 
 
 From time to time, oral or written forward-looking statements are also included in our reports on Forms 10-K, 10-Q, and 8-K, our Schedule 14A, our press releases and other materials released to the public. Although we believe that at the time made, the expectations reflected in all of these forward-looking statements are and will be reasonable; any or all of the forward-looking statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our reports on Forms 10-Q, and 8-K, our Schedule 14A and any other public statements that are made by us may prove to be incorrect. This may occur as a result of inaccurate assumptions or as a consequence of known or unknown risks and uncertainties. Many factors discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, certain of which are beyond our control, will be important in determining our future performance. Consequently, actual results may differ materially from those that might be anticipated from forward-looking statements. In light of these and other uncertainties, you should not regard the inclusion of a forward-looking statement in this Annual Report on Form 10-K or other public communications that we might make as a representation by us that our plans and objectives will be achieved, and you should not place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements. 
 We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. However, your attention is directed to any further disclosures made on related subjects in our subsequent periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Forms 10-Q and 8-K and Schedule 14A. 
 Unless the context requires otherwise, references to we, us, our, ARKR and the Company refer specifically to Ark Restaurants Corp. and its subsidiaries, partnerships, variable interest entities and predecessor entities.

Item 1. Business 
 COVID-19 Pandemic 
 On March 11, 2020, in light of the rapid spread of the novel Coronavirus COVID-19 or Coronavirus ), the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak to be a global pandemic and the United States declared a National Public Health Emergency. The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly disrupted consumer demand, as well as the Company s restaurant operations. Following the pandemic declaration in March 2020, federal, state and local governments began to respond to the public health crisis by requiring social distancing, "stay at home" directives, and mandatory closure of all of our locations. 
 We are subject to continued risks and uncertainties as a result of the outbreak of, and local, state and federal governmental responses to, the COVID-19 pandemic. We experienced significant disruptions to our business as suggested and mandated social distancing and shelter-in-place orders led to the temporary closure of all of our restaurants. In the third quarter of fiscal 2020, certain jurisdictions began allowing the reopening of restaurant dining rooms, and we began to reopen dining rooms. While restrictions on the type of permitted operating model and occupancy capacity may continue to change, as of October 2, 2021, all of our restaurants were operating with no indoor dining restrictions. We cannot predict how long the COVID-19 pandemic will last, whether vaccines will be effective at eliminating or slowing the spread of the virus or variants, whether it will reoccur or whether variants will spike, what additional restrictions may be enacted, to what extent we can maintain sales volumes during or following any resumption of mandated social distancing protocols or vaccination or mask mandates and what long-lasting effects the COVID-19 pandemic may have on the restaurant industry as a whole. The ongoing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, including, but not limited to, labor-related impacts, supply chain disruption and consumer behavior, will determine the continued significance of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic to our operating results and financial position. 
 Overview 
 We are a New York corporation formed in 1983. As of the fiscal year ended October 2, 2021, we owned and/or operated 17 restaurants and bars, 17 fast food concepts and catering operations through our subsidiaries. Four of our restaurant and bar facilities are located in New York City, one is located in Washington, D.C., five are located in Las Vegas, Nevada, one is located in Atlantic City, New Jersey, four are located on the east coast of Florida and two are located on the gulf coast of Alabama. 
 Our restaurants are typically larger, destination properties intended to benefit from high patron traffic attributable to the uniqueness of the location and catered events. All of our expansion in recent years has been through acquisitions as follows: The Rustic Inn in Dania Beach, Florida (2014); Shuckers in Jensen Beach, Florida (2016); two Original Oyster Houses , one in Gulf Shores, Alabama and one in Spanish Fort, Alabama (2017), JB's on the Beach in Deerfield Beach, Florida (2019), and Blue Moon Fish Company (2021) in Lauderdale-by-the-Sea, Florida. 
 The names and themes of each of our restaurants are different except for our two Broadway Burger Bar and Grill restaurants and two Original Oyster House restaurants. The menus in our restaurants are extensive, offering a wide variety of high-quality foods at generally moderate prices. The atmosphere at many of the restaurants is lively and extremely casual. Most of the restaurants have separate bar areas, are open seven days a week and most serve lunch as well as dinner. A majority of our net sales are derived from dinner as opposed to lunch service. 
 While decor differs from restaurant to restaurant, interiors are marked by distinctive architectural and design elements which often incorporate dramatic interior open spaces and extensive glass exteriors. The wall treatments, lighting and decorations are typically vivid, unusual and, in some cases, highly theatrical.

 Leases 
 We are not currently committed to any significant development projects, except for the acquisition of Blue Moon Fish Company discussed below; however, we may take advantage of opportunities we consider to be favorable, when they occur, depending upon the availability of financing and other factors. 
 Restaurant Expansion and Other Developments 
 On December 1, 2020, the Company, through a newly formed, wholly-owned subsidiary, acquired the assets of Bear Ice, Inc. and File Gumbo Inc., which collectively operated a restaurant and bar named Blue Moon Fish Company located in Lauderdale-by-the-Sea, FL. The total purchase price of 2,820,000 was paid with cash in the amount of 1,820,000 and a four-year note held by the sellers in the amount of 1,000,000 payable monthly with 5 interest. Concurrent with the acquisition, the Company assumed the related lease which expires in 2026 and has four five-year extension options. Rent payments under the lease are approximately 360,000 per year and increase by approximately 15 as each option is exercised. 
 7 

On January 26, 2021, the Company exercised its right-of-first-refusal to acquire the land, building and parking lot associated with JB s on the Beach and immediately contributed such rights and interest to an unrelated entity ("Newco") that purchased the properties on March 22, 2021. In exchange, the Company received a 5 interest in Newco, which plans future development of the sites. In addition, all rights and privileges under the current lease were assigned to Newco, as landlord and the lease terms remain unchanged. 
 Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company was in the process of developing three restaurants at a large outdoor mall in Easton, Ohio in partnership with the landlord. In connection therewith, the Company had capitalized costs of approximately 400,000, of which 200,000 was reimbursed by the landlord in October 2020. The Company does not expect this project to continue. Accordingly, the balance of the unreimbursed costs in the amount of 200,000 were written off and are included in general and administrative expenses for the year ended October 3, 2020. 
 The opening of a new restaurant is invariably accompanied by substantial pre-opening expenses and early operating losses associated with the training of personnel, excess kitchen costs, costs of supervision and other expenses during the pre-opening period and during a post-opening shake out period until operations can be considered to be functioning normally. The amount of such pre-opening expenses and early operating losses can generally be expected to depend upon the size and complexity of the facility being opened. 
 Our restaurants generally do not achieve substantial increases in revenue from year to year, which we consider to be typical of the restaurant industry. To achieve significant increases in revenue or to replace revenue of restaurants that lose customer favor or which close because of lease expirations or other reasons, we would have to open additional restaurant facilities or expand existing restaurants. There can be no assurance that a restaurant will be successful after it is opened, particularly since in many instances we do not operate our new restaurants under a trade name currently used by us, thereby requiring new restaurants to establish their own identity. 
 We may take advantage of other opportunities we consider to be favorable, when they occur, depending upon the availability of financing and other factors. 
 Recent Restaurant Dispositions 
 On April 2, 2020, the Company advised the landlord of a catering space in New York, NY that we would be terminating the lease. In connection with this notification, the Company recorded a loss of 364,000 during the year ended October 3, 2020 consisting of (i) rent accrued in accordance with the termination provisions of the lease, (ii) the write-off of the unamortized balance of purchased leasehold rights, (iii) the write-off of our security deposit, (iv) the write-off of ROU assets and related lease liabilities, and (v) the write-off of the net book value of fixed assets. 
 On November 13, 2020, the Company was advised by the landlord that it would have to vacate Gallagher s Steakhouse and Gallagher s Burger Bar at the Resorts Casino Hotel located in Atlantic City, NJ which were on a month-to-month, no rent lease. The closure of these properties occurred on January 2, 2021 and did not result in a material charge to the Company s operations. 
 As of January 2, 2021, the Company determined that it would not reopen Thunder Grill in Washington, D.C. which had been closed since March 20, 2020. This closure did not result in a material charge to the Company s operations. 
 On September 1, 2021, the Company advised the landlord of Clyde Frazier's Wine and Dine that we would be closing the property permanently and terminating the lease. In connection with this notification, the Company recorded a gain of 810,000 during the year ended October 2, 2021 consisting of: (i) rent and other costs incurred in accordance with the termination provisions of the lease in the amount of 318,000, (ii) impairment of long-lived assets in the amount of 69,000 and (iii) the write-off of our security deposit in the amount of 121,000 offset by the write-off of ROU assets and related lease liabilities in the net amount of 1,318,000. 
 Investment in New Meadowlands Racetrack LLC 
 On March 12, 2013, the Company made a 4,200,000 investment in the New Meadowlands Racetrack LLC NMR through its purchase of a membership interest in Meadowlands Newmark, LLC, an existing member of NMR. On November 19, 2013, the Company invested an additional 464,000 in NMR through a purchase of an additional membership interest in Meadowlands Newmark, LLC resulting in a total ownership of 11.6 of Meadowlands Newmark, LLC, and an effective ownership interest in NMR of 7.4 , subject to dilution. In 2015, the Company invested an additional 222,000 in NMR and in February 2017 the Company invested an additional 222,000 in NMR, both as a result of capital calls, bringing its total investment to 5,108,000 with no change in ownership. 
 8 

In addition to the Company s ownership interest in NMR, if casino gaming is approved at the Meadowlands and NMR is granted the right to conduct said gaming, the Company shall be granted the exclusive right to operate the food and beverage concessions in the gaming facility with the exception of one restaurant. 
 In conjunction with this investment, the Company, through a 97 owned subsidiary, Ark Meadowlands LLC AM VIE ), also entered into a long-term agreement with NMR for the exclusive right to operate food and beverage concessions serving the new raceway facilities (the Racing F B Concessions located in the new raceway grandstand constructed at the Meadowlands Racetrack in northern New Jersey. Under the agreement, NMR is responsible to pay for the costs and expenses incurred in the operation of the Racing F B Concessions, and all revenues and profits thereof inure to the benefit of NMR. AM VIE receives an annual fee equal to 5 of the net profits received by NMR from the Racing F B Concessions during each calendar year. 
 On April 25, 2014, the Company loaned 1,500,000 to Meadowlands Newmark, LLC. The note bears interest at 3 , compounded monthly and added to the principal, and is due in its entirety on January 31, 2024. The note may be prepaid, in whole or in part, at any time without penalty or premium. On July 13, 2016, the Company made an additional loan to Meadowlands Newmark, LLC in the amount of 200,000. Such amount is subject to the same terms and conditions as the original loan discussed above. The principal and accrued interest related to this note, after a 500,000 payment made in July 2021, in the amounts of 1,317,000 and 1,766,000, are included in Investment In and Receivable From New Meadowlands Racetrack in the consolidated balance sheets at October 2, 2021 and October 3, 2020, respectively. 
 On June 7, 2018, the New Jersey State Legislature voted to legalize sports betting at casinos and racetracks in the state. Pursuant to this legislation, NMR operates a sports book in partnership with FanDuel, a leading provider of daily fantasy sports. 
 Restaurant Management 
 Each restaurant is managed by its own manager and has its own chef. Food products and other supplies are purchased primarily from various unaffiliated suppliers, in most cases by our headquarters' personnel. Each of our restaurants has two or more assistant managers and sous chefs (assistant chefs). Financial and management control is maintained at the corporate level through the use of automated systems that include centralized accounting and reporting. 
 Purchasing and Distribution 
 We strive to obtain quality menu ingredients, raw materials and other supplies and services for our operations from reliable sources at competitive prices. Substantially all menu items are prepared on each restaurant s premises daily from scratch, using fresh ingredients. Each restaurant s management determines the quantities of food and supplies required and then orders the items from local, regional and national suppliers on terms negotiated by our centralized purchasing staff. Restaurant-level inventories are maintained at a minimum dollar-value level in relation to sales due to the relatively rapid turnover of the perishable produce, poultry, meat, fish and dairy commodities that are used in operations. 
 We attempt to negotiate short-term and long-term supply agreements depending on market conditions and expected demand. However, we do not contract for long periods of time for our fresh commodities such as produce, poultry, meat, fish and dairy items and, consequently, such commodities can be subject to unforeseen supply and cost fluctuations. Independent food service distributors deliver most food and supply items daily to restaurants. The financial impact of the termination of any such supply agreements would not have a material adverse effect on our financial position. We believe that we have established stable long-term relationships with several key suppliers, particularly with respect to crabs and other shellfish. Nevertheless, as a result of global restrictions and uncertainty related to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have experienced product supply delays as we and our supply chain partners experience longer lead times and shortages of products and materials. We believe the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and government responses to the pandemic will continue to impact the ability of our third-party suppliers to supply products to us at the cost and in the time frames and volumes required by us. 
 Competition 
 The hospitality industry is highly competitive and is often affected by changes in taste and entertainment trends among the public, by local, national and economic conditions affecting spending habits, and by population and traffic patterns. We believe that the principal means of competition among restaurants include the location, type and quality of facilities and the type, quality and price of beverage and food served. 
 Our restaurants compete directly or indirectly with many well-established competitors, both nationally and locally owned, some with substantially greater financial resources than we have. Their resources and market presence may provide advantages in marketing, purchasing and negotiating leases. We compete with other restaurant and retail establishments for sites and finding management personnel.

Employees 
 At December 10, 2021, we employed 1,741 persons (including employees at managed facilities), 926 of whom were full-time employees, and 815 of whom were part-time employees; 42 of whom were headquarters personnel, 146 of whom were restaurant management personnel, 586 of whom were kitchen personnel and 967 of whom were restaurant service personnel. A number of our restaurant service personnel are employed on a part-time basis. Changes in minimum wage levels may adversely affect our labor costs and the restaurant industry generally because a large percentage of restaurant personnel are paid at or slightly above the minimum wage. Our employees are not covered by any collective bargaining agreements. 
 We have experienced aggressive competition for talent, wage inflation and pressure to improve workplace conditions and benefits as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic itself could cause a shortage of labor for restaurant positions as concern over exposure to COVID-19 and other factors could decrease the pool of available qualified talent for key roles. Our compensation packages may prove insufficient to attract and retain the best personnel in light of the challenges posed by the pandemic and wage pressures resulting from the labor shortage. Higher employee turnover levels or our failure to recruit and retain new restaurant employees in a timely manner could impact our ability to grow sales at existing restaurants or open new restaurants and result in higher than projected labor costs. 
 Government Regulation 
 We are subject to various federal, state and local laws affecting our business. Each restaurant is subject to licensing and regulation by a number of governmental authorities that may include alcoholic beverage control, health, sanitation, environmental, zoning and public safety agencies in the state or municipality in which the restaurant is located. Difficulties in obtaining or failures to obtain the required licenses or approvals could delay or prevent the development and openings of new restaurants, or could disrupt the operations of existing restaurants. 
 Alcoholic beverage control regulations require each of our restaurants to apply to a state authority and, in certain locations, county and municipal authorities for licenses and permits to sell alcoholic beverages on the premises. Typically, licenses must be renewed annually and may be subject to penalties, temporary suspension or revocation for cause at any time. Alcoholic beverage control regulations impact many aspects of the daily operations of our restaurants, including the minimum ages of patrons and employees consuming or serving such beverages; employee alcoholic beverages training and certification requirements; hours of operation; advertising; wholesale purchasing and inventory control of such beverages; seating of minors and the service of food within our bar areas; and the storage and dispensing of alcoholic beverages. State and local authorities in many jurisdictions routinely monitor compliance with alcoholic beverage laws. The failure to receive or retain, or a delay in obtaining, a liquor license for a particular restaurant could adversely affect our ability to obtain such licenses in jurisdictions where the failure to receive or retain, or a delay in obtaining, a liquor license occurred. 
 We are subject to dram-shop statutes in most of the states in which we have operations, which generally provide a person injured by an intoxicated person the right to recover damages from an establishment that wrongfully served alcoholic beverages to such person. We carry liquor liability coverage as part of our existing comprehensive general liability insurance. A settlement or judgment against us under a dram-shop statute in excess of liability coverage could have a material adverse effect on our operations. 
 Various federal and state labor laws govern our operations and our relationship with employees, including such matters as minimum wages, breaks, overtime, fringe benefits, safety, working conditions and citizenship requirements. We are also subject to the regulations of the Immigration and Naturalization Service. If our employees do not meet federal citizenship or residency requirements, their deportation could lead to a disruption in our work force. Significant government-imposed increases in minimum wages, paid leaves of absence and mandated health benefits, or increased tax reporting, assessment or payment requirements related to employees who receive gratuities could be detrimental to our profitability. 
 Our facilities must comply with the applicable requirements of the Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990 ADA and related state statutes. The ADA prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability with respect to public accommodations and employment. Under the ADA and related state laws, when constructing new restaurants or undertaking significant remodeling of existing restaurants, we must make them more readily accessible to disabled persons. 
 The New York State Liquor Authority must approve any transaction in which a shareholder of the licensee increases his holdings to 10 or more of the outstanding capital stock of the licensee and any transaction involving 10 or more of the outstanding capital stock of the licensee. 
 
 On September 9, 2021, the President announced a proposed new rule requiring that all employers with at least 100 employees require that their employees be fully vaccinated or tested weekly. At this time, it is unclear, among other things, when such a 
 10 

vaccine mandate, or any other mandate (such as in New York City, as is currently being discussed) will go into effect (or if any will go into effect at all); whether any will apply to all employees or only to employees who work in the office; and how compliance will be documented. As a company with more than 100 employees, it is anticipated that, should vaccine mandates go into effect, we would be subject to the OSHA regulation concerning COVID-19 vaccination and the vaccine mandate. Should such a mandate apply to us, we may be required to implement a requirement that all of our employees get vaccinated, subject to limited exceptions. At this time, it is not possible to predict the impact that such a vaccine mandate, any other vaccine mandate, or a vaccine requirement should we adopt one, will have on us or on our workforce. Any vaccine requirement or vaccine mandate, including if implemented, may result in employee attrition, which could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations. 
 Seasonal Nature of Business 
 Our business is highly seasonal; however, our broader geographical reach as a result of recent acquisitions mitigates some of the risk. For instance, the second quarter of our fiscal year, consisting of the non-holiday portion of the cold weather season in New York and Washington (January, February and March), is the poorest performing quarter; however, in recent years this has been partially offset by our locations in Florida as they experience increased results in the winter months. We achieve our best results during the warm weather, attributable to our extensive outdoor dining availability, particularly at Bryant Park in New York and Sequoia in Washington, D.C. (our largest restaurants) and our outdoor cafes. However, even during summer months these facilities can be adversely affected by unusually cool or rainy weather conditions. Our facilities in Las Vegas are indoor and generally operate on a more consistent basis throughout the year.

Item 2. Properties 
 Our restaurant facilities and our executive offices, with the exception of The Rustic Inn in Dania Beach, Florida, Shuckers in Jensen Beach, Florida and the two Original Oyster House properties in Alabama, are occupied under leases. Most of our restaurant leases provide for the payment of base rents plus real estate taxes, insurance and other expenses and, in certain instances, for the payment of a percentage of our sales at such facility. As of October 2, 2021, these leases (including leases for managed restaurants) have terms (including any available renewal options) expiring as follows:

 Our executive, administrative and clerical offices are located in approximately 8,500 square feet of office space at 85 Fifth Avenue, New York, New York. Our lease for this office space expires in 2026 and contains two, five-year extension options. 
 For information concerning our future minimum rental commitments under non-cancelable operating leases, see Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information concerning our leases. 
 
 Item 3. Legal Proceedings 
 In the ordinary course of our business, we are a party to various lawsuits arising from accidents at our restaurants and workers compensation claims, which are generally handled by our insurance carriers. 
 Our employment of management personnel, waiters, waitresses and kitchen staff at a number of different restaurants has resulted in the institution, from time to time, of litigation alleging violation by us of employment discrimination laws. We do not believe that any of such suits will have a material adverse effect upon us, our financial condition or operations. 
 Except as otherwise provided below, the Company is not subject to pending legal proceedings, other than ordinary claims incidental to its business, which the Company does not believe will materially impact results of operations. 
 On May 1, 2018, two former tipped service workers (the Plaintiffs ), individually and on behalf of all other similarly situated personnel, filed a putative class action lawsuit (the Complaint against the Company and certain subsidiaries as well as certain officers of the Company (the Defendants ). Plaintiffs alleged, on behalf of themselves and the putative class, that the Company violated certain of the New York State Labor Laws and related regulations. The Complaint sought unspecified money damages, together with interest, liquidated damages and attorney fees. In December 2020, the parties reached a settlement agreement resolving all issues alleged in the Complaint, which received preliminary approval by the New York State Supreme Court, for approximately the amount which was previously accrued. It is anticipated the parties will shortly submit a joint application to the New York State Supreme Court seeking final approval of the settlement.

 On March 13, 2020, the Company announced that, in light of the unprecedented circumstances and rapidly changing situation with respect to COVID-19, as part of an overall plan to preserve cash flow, the Board of Directors determined that it was appropriate for the Company to defer payment of the dividend that was declared on March 2, 2020. 
 On July 1, 2020, the dividend declared on March 2, 2020 was canceled. 
 The payment of future dividends is at the discretion of the Company s Board of Directors and is based on future earnings, cash flow, financial condition, capital requirements, changes in U.S. taxation and other relevant factors.

 The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes included under Item 8 of this annual report. This discussion contains forward-looking statements, which involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including but not limited to, those discussed elsewhere in this annual report.

 COVID-19 Pandemic 
 On March 11, 2020, in light of the rapid spread of the novel Coronavirus COVID-19 or "Coronavirus"), the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak to be a global pandemic and the United States declared a National Public Health Emergency. The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly disrupted consumer demand, as well as the Company s restaurant operations. Following the pandemic declaration in March 2020, federal, state and local governments began to respond to the public health crisis by requiring social distancing, "stay at home" directives, and mandatory closure of all of our locations. 
 We are subject to continued risks and uncertainties as a result of the outbreak of, and local, state and federal governmental responses to, the COVID-19 pandemic. We experienced significant disruptions to our business as suggested and mandated social distancing and shelter-in-place orders led to the temporary closure of all of our restaurants. In the third quarter of fiscal 2020, certain jurisdictions began allowing the reopening of restaurant dining rooms, and we began to reopen dining rooms. While restrictions on the type of permitted operating model and occupancy capacity may continue to change, as of October 2, 2021, all of our restaurants were operating with no indoor dining restrictions. We cannot predict how long the COVID-19 pandemic will last, whether vaccines will be effective at eliminating or slowing the spread of the virus or variants, whether it will reoccur or whether variants will spike, what additional restrictions may be enacted, to what extent we can maintain sales volumes during or following any resumption of mandated social distancing protocols or vaccination or mask mandates and what long-lasting effects the COVID-19 pandemic may have on the restaurant industry as a whole. The ongoing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, including, but not limited to, labor-related impacts, supply chain disruption and consumer behavior, will determine the continued significance of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic to our operating results and financial position. 
 Overview 
 As of October 2, 2021, the Company owned and operated 17 restaurants and bars, 17 fast food concepts and catering operations, exclusively in the United States, that have similar economic characteristics, nature of products and service, class of customer and distribution methods. The Company believes it meets the criteria for aggregating its operating segments into a single reporting segment in accordance with applicable accounting guidance. The consolidated statements of operations for the year ended October 2, 2021 includes revenues and income of approximately 5,929,000 and 981,000, respectively, related to Blue Moon Fish Company , which was acquired on December 1, 2020. As of September 1, 2021, the Company advised the landlord of Clyde Frazier's Wine and Dine that we would be closing the property permanently and terminating the lease. In connection with this notification, the Company recorded a gain of 810,000 during the year ended October 2, 2021 consisting of: (i) rent and other costs incurred in accordance with the termination provisions of the lease in the amount of 318,000, (ii) impairment of long-lived assets in the amount of 69,000 and (iii) the write-off of our security deposit in the amount of 121,000 offset by the write-off of ROU assets and related lease liabilities in the net amount of 1,318,000. 

15 

Accounting Period 
 Our fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest September 30. We report fiscal years under a 52/53-week format. This reporting method is used by many companies in the hospitality industry and is meant to improve year-to-year comparisons of operating results. Under this method, certain years will contain 53 weeks. The fiscal years ended October 2, 2021 and October 3, 2020 included 52 and 53 weeks, respectively. 
 Seasonality 
 The Company has substantial fixed costs that do not decline proportionally with sales. Although our business is highly seasonal, our broader geographical reach as a result of recent acquisitions mitigates some of the risk. For instance, the second quarter of our fiscal year, consisting of the non-holiday portion of the cold weather season in New York and Washington (January, February and March), is the poorest performing quarter; however, in recent years this has been partially offset by our locations in Florida as they experience increased results in the winter months. We generally achieve our best results during the warm weather, attributable to our extensive outdoor dining availability, particularly at Bryant Park in New York and Sequoia in Washington, D.C. (our largest restaurants) and our outdoor cafes. However, even during summer months these facilities can be adversely affected by unusually cool or rainy weather conditions. Our facilities in Las Vegas are indoor and generally operate on a more consistent basis throughout the year. 
 Results of Operations 
 The Company s operating income for the year ended October 2, 2021 was 6,207,000 as compared to an operating loss of (7,796,000) for the year ended October 3, 2020. This increase resulted primarily from the strong performance of our Florida, Alabama and Las Vegas operations in the current year combined with the government mandated closure of our restaurants in March 2020 in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic, with limited capacity when they reopened, as well as a 364,000 loss on the termination of a lease. In addition to the decrease in restaurant revenue from the mandatory closures and operating at varying levels of limited capacity in the year ended October 3, 2020, the Company estimates that it incurred approximately 3,150,000 of costs directly related to COVID-19 consisting primarily of payments to employees for paid-time off during restaurant closures, inventory waste, and rent and rent related costs for closed restaurants from the day that they closed. 
 The following table summarizes the significant components of the Company s operating results for the years ended October 2, 2021 and October 3, 2020, respectively: 
 Year Ended Variance October 2, 2021 October 3, 2020 REVENUES: Food and beverage sales 128,988 104,062 24,926 24.0 Other revenue 2,882 2,428 454 18.7 Total revenues 131,870 106,490 25,380 23.8 COSTS AND EXPENSES: Food and beverage cost of sales 38,950 28,583 10,367 36.3 Payroll expenses 42,579 40,975 1,604 3.9 Occupancy expenses 14,747 15,391 (644) -4.2 Other operating costs and expenses 16,044 14,757 1,287 8.7 General and administrative expenses 10,523 10,160 363 3.6 (Gain) loss on lease termination (810) 364 (1,174) -322.5 Depreciation and amortization 3,630 4,056 (426) -10.5 Total costs and expenses 125,663 114,286 11,377 10.0 OPERATING INCOME (LOSS) 6,207 (7,796) 14,003 -179.6

Revenues 
 During the year ended October 2, 2021, revenues increased 23.8 as compared to revenues in the year ended October 3, 2020. This increase resulted primarily from our properties operating with fewer or no capacity restrictions in the current year in comparison to prior year as a result of government mandates in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic. 
 Food and Beverage Same-Store Sales 
 On a Company-wide basis, same-store food and beverage sales increased 25.4 for the year ended October 2, 2021 as compared to the year ended October 3, 2020 as follows: 
 Year Ended Variance October 2, 2021 October 3, 2020 (in thousands) Las Vegas 37,767 30,445 7,322 24.0 New York 15,037 15,968 (931) -5.8 Washington, D.C. 8,169 5,740 2,429 42.3 Atlantic City, NJ 2,055 1,187 868 73.1 Connecticut 384 859 (475) -55.3 Alabama 14,506 10,813 3,693 34.2 Florida 44,889 32,935 11,954 36.3 Same-store sales 122,807 97,947 24,860 25.4 Other 6,181 6,115 Food and beverage sales 128,988 104,062 
 The increase in company-wide same-store sales was driven primarily by increased customer traffic as a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the prior year combined with targeted increases in menu pricing in the current year. Same-store sales in New York decreased 5.8 due to lower traffic in midtown Manhattan where our properties are located as a result of companies allowing employees to continue to work from home. Same-store sales in Connecticut decreased 55.3 due to declining traffic at the Foxwoods Resort and Casino where our property is located. 
 Other food and beverage sales consist of sales related to new restaurants opened or acquired during the applicable period Blue Moon Fish Company - 5,929,000 in 2021), sales related to properties that were closed Clyde Frazier's Wine and Dine - 866,000 in 2021 and 2,038,000 in 2020, Gallagher's Steakhouse and Gallagher's Burger Bar - 430,000 in 2021 and 2,205,000 in 2020 and Thunder Grill - 1,034,000 in 2020) and other adjustments and fees. 
 Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, our restaurants generally did not achieve substantial increases in revenue from year to year, which we consider to be typical of the restaurant industry. To achieve significant increases in revenue or to replace revenue of restaurants that lose customer favor or which close because of lease expirations or other reasons, we would have to open additional restaurant facilities or expand existing restaurants. There can be no assurance that a restaurant will be successful after it is opened, particularly since in many instances we do not operate our new restaurants under a trade name currently used by us, thereby requiring new restaurants to establish their own identity. 
 Other Revenues 
 Included in Other Revenues are purchase service fees which represent commissions earned by a subsidiary of the Company for providing purchasing services to other restaurant groups, as well as merchandise sales, license fees, property management fees and other rentals. The increase in Other Revenues for the year ended October 2, 2021 as compared to the year ended October 3, 2020 is primarily due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in the prior year. 
 17 

Costs and Expenses 
 Costs and expenses for the years ended October 2, 2021 and October 3, 2020 were as follows (in thousands): 
 Year Ended October 2, 2021 to Total Revenues Year Ended October 3, 2020 to Total Revenues Increase (Decrease) Food and beverage cost of sales 38,950 29.5 28,583 26.8 10,367 36.3 Payroll expenses 42,579 32.3 40,975 38.5 1,604 3.9 Occupancy expenses 14,747 11.2 15,391 14.5 (644) -4.2 Other operating costs and expenses 16,044 12.2 14,757 13.9 1,287 8.7 General and administrative expenses 10,523 8.0 10,160 9.5 363 3.6 (Gain) loss on lease termination (810) -0.6 364 0.3 (1,174) -322.5 Depreciation and amortization 3,630 2.8 4,056 3.8 (426) -10.5 Total costs and expenses 125,663 114,286 11,377 
 
 Food and beverage costs as a percentage of total revenues for the year ended October 2, 2021 increased as compared to last year primarily as a result of increases in crab, seafood, chicken and beef prices. 
 
 Payroll expenses as a percentage of total revenues for the year ended October 2, 2021 decreased as compared to last year primarily as a result of retaining key restaurant management personnel with lower corresponding revenues in the prior period as a result of the government mandated closures and/or capacity restrictions at all of our restaurants in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic partially offset by higher group medical costs, wage rates and overtime in fiscal 2021. 
 
 Occupancy expenses as a percentage of total revenues for the year ended October 2, 2021 decreased as compared to last year primarily as a result of the finalization of several abatements with landlords resulting in a reduction of rent expense in the amount of 800,000 in the current year. 
 
 Other operating costs and expenses as a percentage of total revenues for the year ended October 2, 2021 decreased as compared to last year as a result of the fixed nature of some of these expenses and lower sales in the prior period as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, decreased maintenance at properties where we are experiencing lower traffic and increased professional fees at the restaurant-level in the prior periods. 
 
 General and administrative expenses (which relate solely to the corporate office in New York City) as a percentage of total revenues for the year ended October 2, 2021 decreased as compared to last year primarily as a result of lower legal fees in the current period partially offset by headcount and salary reductions of corporate personnel in the prior period as a result of the impacts on our business from the COVID-19 pandemic. 
 
 Depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended October 2, 2021 decreased as compared to last year primarily as a result of lower charges in the current period as a result of asset impairments in the first quarter of 2020. 
 
 (Gain) Loss on Lease Termination 
 On September 1, 2021, the Company advised the landlord of Clyde Frazier's Wine and Dine that we would be closing the property permanently and terminating the lease. In connection with this notification, the Company recorded a gain of 810,000 during the year ended October 2, 2021 consisting of: (i) rent and other costs incurred in accordance with the termination provisions of the lease in the amount of 318,000, (ii) impairment of long-lived assets in the amount of 69,000 and (iii) the write-off of our security deposit in the amount of 121,000 offset by the write-off of ROU assets and related lease liabilities in the net amount of 1,318,000. 
 On April 2, 2020, the Company advised the landlord of a catering space in New York, NY that we would be terminating the lease. In connection with this notification, the Company recorded a loss of 364,000 during the 13 weeks ended March 28, 2020, consisting of (i) rent accrued in accordance with the termination provisions of the lease, (ii) the write-off of the unamortized balance of purchased leasehold rights, (iii) the write-off of our security deposit, (iv) the write-off of ROU assets and related lease liabilities, and (v) the write-off of net book value of fixed assets.

 Management continually evaluates unfavorable cash flows, if any, related to underperforming restaurants. Periodically it is concluded that certain properties have become impaired based on their existing and anticipated future economic outlook in their respective markets. In such instances, we may impair assets to reduce their carrying values to fair values. Estimated fair values of impaired properties are based on comparable valuations, cash flows and/or management judgment. Included in the year ended October 2, 2021 is an impairment charge of 69,000 related to Clyde Frazier's Wine and Dine. 
 
 Income Taxes 
 Our income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities, and liabilities for uncertain tax positions reflect management s best estimate of current and future taxes to be paid. We are subject to income tax in numerous state taxing jurisdictions. Significant judgment and estimates are required in the determination of consolidated income tax expense. The provision for income taxes reflects federal income taxes calculated on a consolidated basis and state and local income taxes which are calculated on a separate entity basis. 
 For state and local income tax purposes, certain losses incurred by a subsidiary may only be used to offset that subsidiary s income, with the exception of the restaurants operating in the District of Columbia. Accordingly, our overall effective tax rate has varied depending on the level of income and losses incurred at individual subsidiaries. 
 Deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements, which will result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future. In evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets in the jurisdiction from which they arise, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax-planning strategies, and results of recent operations. The assumptions about future taxable income require the use of significant judgment and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses. 
 On March 27, 2020, the CARES Act was enacted to provide economic relief to those impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition to the Paycheck Protection Program loans, the CARES Act made various tax law changes including among other things (i) modifications to the federal net operating loss rules including permitting federal net operating losses incurred in 2018, 2019, and 2020 tax years to be carried back to the five preceding taxable years in order to generate a refund of previously paid income taxes, (ii) enhanced recoverability of AMT tax credit carryforwards, (iii) increased the limitation under Internal Revenue Code ("IRC") Section 163(j) for 2019 and 2020 to permit additional expensing of interest, and (iv) enacted a technical correction so that qualified improvement property can be immediately expensed under IRC Section 168(k). 
 
 On December 27, 2020, the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021 CAA was enacted and provided clarification on the tax deductibility of expenses funded with PPP loans as fully deductible for tax purposes. During the year ended October 2, 2021, the Company recorded income for financial reporting purposes related to the forgiveness of 10,400,000 (including 84,000 of accrued interest) of its PPP loans. The forgiveness of these amounts is not taxable. 
 
 As a result of the CARES Act and the CAA, the Company carried back taxable losses from fiscal year 2020 and is expected to carryback taxable losses from fiscal 2021 to generate a refund of previously paid income taxes. As a result of these carrybacks, the Company recorded income tax benefits as the taxable losses from fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2021 are being carried back to tax years in which the Company was subject to a higher federal corporate income tax rate. Included in Prepaid and Refundable Income Taxes at October 2, 2021 is 3,766,000 related to these carryback claims. 
 
 The Company s overall effective tax rate in the future will be affected by factors such as the utilization of state and local net operating loss carryforwards, the generation of FICA tax credits and the mix of earnings by state taxing jurisdictions as Nevada does not impose a state income tax, as compared to the other major state and local jurisdictions in which the Company has operations. Our overall effective tax rate in the future will be affected by factors such as income earned by our VIEs, generation of FICA TIP credits and the mix of geographical income for state tax purposes as Nevada does not impose an income tax. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Our primary source of capital has been cash provided by operations and, in recent years, bank and other borrowings to finance specific transactions, acquisitions and large remodeling projects. We utilize cash generated from operations to fund the cost of developing and opening new restaurants and smaller remodeling projects of existing restaurants we own. Consistent with many other restaurant operators, we typically use operating lease arrangements for our restaurants. In recent years we have been able to acquire the underlying real estate at several locations along with the restaurant operation. We believe that our operating lease 
 19 

arrangements provide appropriate leverage of our capital structure in a financially efficient manner. As of October 2, 2021, we had a cash and cash equivalents balance of 19,171,000. 
 We are subject to continued risks and uncertainties as a result of the outbreak of, and local, state and federal governmental responses to, the COVID-19 pandemic which was declared a National Public Health Emergency in March 2020. We experienced significant disruptions to our business as suggested and mandated social distancing and shelter-in-place orders led to the temporary closure of all of our restaurants. In the third quarter of fiscal 2020, certain jurisdictions began allowing the reopening of restaurant dining rooms, and we began to reopen dining rooms. While restrictions on the type of permitted operating model and occupancy capacity may continue to change, as of October 2, 2021, all of our restaurants were operating with no indoor dining restrictions. We cannot predict how long the COVID-19 pandemic will last, whether vaccines will be effective at eliminating or slowing the spread of the virus or variants, whether it will reoccur or whether variants will spike, what additional restrictions may be enacted, to what extent we can maintain sales volumes during or following any resumption of mandated social distancing protocols or vaccination or mask mandates and what long-lasting effects the COVID-19 pandemic may have on the restaurant industry as a whole. The ongoing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, including, but not limited to, labor-related impacts, supply chain disruption and consumer behavior, will determine the continued significance of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic to our operating results and financial position. 
 The Company had a working capital of 2,572,000 at October 2, 2021 as compared with a deficiency of (3,234,000) at October 3, 2020. This increase resulted primarily from cash provided by operations offset by a change in our debt maturities in connection with conversion of our revolving credit borrowings to term loans. We believe that our existing cash balances and current banking facilities will be sufficient to meet our liquidity and capital spending requirements and finance our operating activities for at least the next 12 months. 
 Cash Flows for the Years Ended October 2, 2021 and October 3, 2020 
 Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended October 2, 2021 increased to 9,294,000 as compared to (4,528,000) used in operations for the year ended October 3, 2020. This increase was attributable to an increase in operating income as a result of the continued recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic and changes in net working capital primarily related to accounts receivable, inventory, prepaid, refundable and accrued income taxes and accounts payable and accrued expenses. 
 Net cash used in investing activities for the years ended October 2, 2021 and October 3, 2020 was (3,450,000) and (2,457,000), respectively, and resulted primarily from purchases of fixed assets at existing restaurants and, in the current period, the cash portion of the purchase price of the Blue Moon Fish Company acquisition. 
 Net cash used in financing activities for the year ended October 2, 2021 of (3,559,000) resulted primarily from principal payments on notes payable and the payment of distributions to non-controlling interests partially offset by proceeds from stock option exercises. Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended October 3, 2020 of 16,694,000 resulted primarily from borrowings under our credit facility and proceeds from PPP loans partially offset by principal payments on notes payable and the payment of dividends. 
 On November 26, 2019, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of 0.25 per share on the Company s common stock which was paid on January 7, 2020, to shareholders of record at the close of business on December 16, 2019. 
 On March 13, 2020, the Company announced that, in light of the unprecedented circumstances and rapidly changing situation with respect to COVID-19, as part of an overall plan to preserve cash flow, the Board of Directors determined that it was appropriate for the Company to defer payment of the dividend that was declared on March 2, 2020. Payment of such dividend, which was scheduled for April 6, 2020 to shareholders of record on March 16, 2020, was canceled on July 1, 2020. 
 The Company s leases at the New York-New York Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas, Nevada are scheduled to expire in January 2023. The Company is currently negotiating extensions with the landlord. The failure to reach new agreements will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows. 
 The payment of future dividends is at the discretion of the Company s Board of Directors and is based on future earnings, cash flow, financial condition, capital requirements and other relevant factors. The Company does not expect to pay quarterly cash dividends for the foreseeable future as a result of the disruption to its operations from the COVID-19 pandemic.

Restaurant Expansion and Other Developments 
 Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company was in the process of developing three restaurants at a large outdoor mall in Easton, Ohio in partnership with the landlord. In connection therewith, the Company had capitalized costs of approximately 400,000, of which 200,000 was reimbursed by the landlord in October 2020. The Company does not expect this project to continue. Accordingly, the balance of the unreimbursed costs in the amount of 200,000 were written off and are included in general and administrative expenses for the year ended October 3, 2020. 
 On December 1, 2020, the Company, through a newly formed, wholly-owned subsidiary, acquired the assets of Bear Ice, Inc. and File Gumbo Inc., which collectively operated a restaurant and bar named Blue Moon Fish Company located in Lauderdale-by-the-Sea, FL. The total purchase price of 2,820,000 was paid with cash in the amount of 1,820,000 and a four-year note held by the sellers in the amount of 1,000,000 payable monthly with 5 interest. Concurrent with the acquisition, the Company assumed the related lease which expires in 2026 and has four five-year extension options. Rent payments under the lease are approximately 360,000 per year and increase by approximately 15 as each option is exercised. 
 On January 26, 2021, the Company exercised its right-of-first-refusal to acquire the land, building and parking lot associated with JB s on the Beach and immediately contributed such rights and interest to an unrelated entity ("Newco") that purchased the properties on March 22, 2021. In exchange, the Company received a 5 interest in Newco, which plans future development of the sites. In addition, all rights and privileges under the current lease were assigned to Newco, as landlord and the lease terms remain unchanged. 
 The opening of a new restaurant is invariably accompanied by substantial pre-opening expenses and early operating losses associated with the training of personnel, excess kitchen costs, costs of supervision and other expenses during the pre-opening period and during a post-opening shake out period until operations can be considered to be functioning normally. The amount of such pre-opening expenses and early operating losses can generally be expected to depend upon the size and complexity of the facility being opened. 
 Our restaurants generally do not achieve substantial increases in revenue from year to year, which we consider to be typical of the restaurant industry. To achieve significant increases in revenue or to replace revenue of restaurants that lose customer favor or which close because of lease expirations or other reasons, we would have to open additional restaurant facilities or expand existing restaurants. There can be no assurance that a restaurant will be successful after it is opened, particularly since in many instances we do not operate our new restaurants under a trade name currently used by us, thereby requiring new restaurants to establish their own identity. 
 We may take advantage of other opportunities we consider to be favorable, when they occur, depending upon the availability of financing and other factors. 
 Recent Restaurant Dispositions 
 On April 2, 2020, the Company advised the landlord of a catering space in New York, NY that we would be terminating the lease. In connection with this notification, the Company recorded a loss of 364,000 at March 28, 2020, consisting of rent accrued in accordance with the termination provisions of the lease, the write-off of the unamortized balance of purchased leasehold rights, our security deposit and the net book value of fixed assets. 
 On November 13, 2020, the Company was advised by the landlord that it would have to vacate Gallagher s Steakhouse and Gallagher s Burger Bar at the Resorts Casino Hotel located in Atlantic City, NJ which were on a month-to-month, no rent lease. The closure of these properties occurred on January 2, 2021 and did not result in a material charge to the Company s operations. 
 
 As of January 2, 2021, the Company determined that it would not reopen Thunder Grill in Washington, D.C. which had been closed since March 20, 2020. This closure did not result in a material charge to the Company s operations. 
 
 On September 1, 2021, the Company advised the landlord of Clyde Frazier's Wine and Dine that we would be closing the property permanently and terminating the lease. In connection with this notification, the Company recorded a gain of 810,000 during the year ended October 2, 2021 consisting of: (i) rent and other costs incurred in accordance with the termination provisions of the lease in the amount of 318,000, (ii) impairment of long-lived assets in the amount of 69,000 and (iii) the write-off of our security deposit in the amount of 121,000 offset by the write-off of ROU assets and related lease liabilities in the net amount of 1,318,000.

Investment in and Receivable from New Meadowlands Racetrack 
 On March 12, 2013, the Company made a 4,200,000 investment in the New Meadowlands Racetrack LLC NMR through its purchase of a membership interest in Meadowlands Newmark, LLC, an existing member of NMR. On November 19, 2013, the Company invested an additional 464,000 in NMR through a purchase of an additional membership interest in Meadowlands Newmark, LLC resulting in a total ownership of 11.6 of Meadowlands Newmark, LLC, and an effective ownership interest in NMR of 7.4 , subject to dilution. In 2015, the Company invested an additional 222,000 in NMR with no change in ownership. In February 2017 the Company funded its proportionate share 222,000) of a 3,000,000 capital call bringing its total investment to 5,108,000 with no change in ownership. 
 In addition to the Company s ownership interest in NMR, if casino gaming is approved at the Meadowlands and NMR is granted the right to conduct said gaming, the Company shall be granted the exclusive right to operate the food and beverage concessions in the gaming facility with the exception of one restaurant. 
 In conjunction with this investment, the Company, through a 97 owned subsidiary, Ark Meadowlands LLC AM VIE ), also entered into a long-term agreement with NMR for the exclusive right to operate food and beverage concessions serving the new raceway facilities (the Racing F B Concessions located in the new raceway grandstand constructed at the Meadowlands Racetrack in northern New Jersey. Under the agreement, NMR is responsible to pay for the costs and expenses incurred in the operation of the Racing F B Concessions, and all revenues and profits thereof inure to the benefit of NMR. AM VIE receives an annual fee equal to 5 of the net profits received by NMR from the Racing F B Concessions during each calendar year. 
 On April 25, 2014, the Company loaned 1,500,000 to Meadowlands Newmark, LLC. The note bears interest at 3 , compounded monthly and added to the principal, and is due in its entirety on January 31, 2024. The note may be prepaid, in whole or in part, at any time without penalty or premium. On July 13, 2016, the Company made an additional loan to Meadowlands Newmark, LLC in the amount of 200,000. Such amount is subject to the same terms and conditions as the original loan as discussed above. The principal and accrued interest related to this note, after a 500,000 payment made in July 2021, in the amounts of 1,317,000 and 1,766,000, are included in Investment In and Receivable From New Meadowlands Racetrack in the consolidated balance sheets at October 2, 2021 and October 3, 2020, respectively. 
 On June 7, 2018, the New Jersey State Legislature voted to legalize sports betting at casinos and racetracks in the state. Pursuant to this legislation, NMR operates a sports book in partnership with FanDuel, a leading provider of daily fantasy sports. 
 Notes Payable Bank 
 On June 1, 2018, the Company refinanced (the "Refinancing") its then existing indebtedness with its current lender, Bank Hapoalim B.M. BHBM ), by entering into an amended and restated credit agreement (the Revolving Facility ), which was to mature on May 19, 2022 (as extended). The Revolving Facility provided for total availability of the lesser of (i) 10,000,000 and (ii) 35,000,000 less the then aggregate amount of all indebtedness and obligations to BHBM. On July 26, 2021, all outstanding Revolver Borrowings, in the amount of 9,666,000, were converted to a promissory note with quarterly principal payments of 500,000 commencing on September 1, 2021, with a balloon payment of 2,166,000 on June 1, 2025. Such note bears interest at LIBOR plus 3.5 per annum. We expect that the LIBOR rate will be discontinued at some point during 2022 and to work with BHBM to identify a suitable replacement rate and amend our debt agreements to reflect this new reference rate accordingly. We do not expect the discontinuation of LIBOR as a reference rate in our debt agreements to have a material adverse effect on our financial position or materially affect our interest expense. 
 Borrowings under the Revolving Facility, which include the promissory notes as discussed in Note 10 of the consolidated financial statements in the aggregate amount of 27,047,000, are secured by all tangible and intangible personal property (including accounts receivable, inventory, equipment, general intangibles, documents, chattel paper, instruments, letter-of-credit rights, investment property, intellectual property and deposit accounts) and fixtures of the Company. The loan agreements provide, among other things, that the Company meet minimum quarterly tangible net worth amounts, maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio and meet minimum annual net income amounts. The loan agreements also contain customary representations, warranties and affirmative covenants as well as customary negative covenants, subject to negotiated exceptions on liens, relating to other indebtedness, capital expenditures, liens, affiliate transactions, disposal of assets and certain changes in ownership. 
 On June 12, 2020 and again on February 15, 2021, as a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, BHBM agreed to modified financial covenants through fiscal Q2 2022. The Company was in compliance with all of its financial covenants under the Revolving Facility as of October 2, 2021.

Paycheck Protection Program Loans 
 During the year ended October 3, 2020, subsidiaries (the Borrowers of the Company received loan proceeds from several banks (the Lenders in the aggregate amount of 14,995,000 (the PPP Loans under the Paycheck Protection Program (the PPP of the CARES Act, which was enacted March 27, 2020. In addition, during the 13 weeks ended April 3, 2021, one of our consolidated VIEs received a second draw PPP Loan in the amount of 111,000. The PPP Loans are evidenced by individual promissory notes of each of the Borrowers (together, the Notes in favor of the Lender, which Notes bear interest at the rate of 1.00 per annum. Funds from the PPP Loans may be used only for payroll and related costs, costs used to continue group health care benefits, mortgage payments, rent, utilities, and interest on other debt obligations that were incurred by a Borrower prior to February 15, 2020 (the Qualifying Expenses ). Under the terms of the PPP Loans, some or all of the amounts thereunder, including accrued interest, may be forgiven if they are used for Qualifying Expenses as described in and in compliance with the CARES Act. Each Note may be prepaid by the respective Borrower at any time prior to maturity with no prepayment penalties. No payments of principal or interest are due under the Notes until the date on which the amount of loan forgiveness (if any) under the CARES Act for each respective Note is remitted to the Lender and a forgiveness decision is received by the Borrower. Forgiveness applications can be submitted up to 10 months after the end of the related notes covered period (which is defined as 24 weeks after the date of the loan) (the Deferral Period and the ultimate forgiveness decisions can be made by the Lenders up to 60 days after submitting the applications and possibly longer if forgiveness is fully or partially denied and the Borrower appeals the decision. While the Company believes that it and each Borrower used the PPP Loan proceeds exclusively for Qualifying Expenses, it is unclear and uncertain whether the conditions for forgiveness of the PPP Loans outstanding at October 2, 2021 will be met under the current guidelines of the CARES Act. Therefore, we cannot make any assurances that the Company, or any of the Borrowers, will be eligible for forgiveness of the remaining PPP Loans, in whole or in part. Accordingly, based on the above, we have classified 2,032,000 of the PPP Loans as short-term in the consolidated balance sheet as of October 2, 2021. 
 During the year ended October 2, 2021, 10,400,000 (including 84,000 of accrued interest) of PPP Loans were forgiven. To the extent, if any, that any of the remaining PPP Loans are not forgiven, beginning one month following expiration of the Deferral Period, and continuing monthly for 10 months (the Maturity Date ), each respective Borrower is obligated to make monthly payments of principal and interest to the Lender with respect to any unforgiven portion of the Notes, in such equal amounts required to fully amortize the principal amount outstanding on such Notes as of the last day of the applicable Deferral Period by the applicable Maturity Date. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies 
 Our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements. While all of these significant accounting policies impact our financial condition and results of operations, we view certain of these policies as critical. Policies determined to be critical are those policies that have the most significant impact on our consolidated financial statements and require management to use a greater degree of judgment and estimates. Actual results may differ from those estimates. 
 We believe that given current facts and circumstances, it is unlikely that applying any other reasonable judgments or estimate methodologies would cause a material effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows for the periods presented in this report. 
 Below are listed certain policies that management believes are critical: 
 Revenue Recognition 
 In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, and issued subsequent amendments to the initial guidance to provide additional clarification on specific topics ASC 606 ). This ASU provides a comprehensive new revenue recognition model that requires a company to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to a customer at an amount that reflects the consideration it expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. We adopted ASC 606 using the modified retrospective method on September 30, 2018 and, based on our evaluation of our revenue streams, determined that there was not a material impact as of the date of adoption between the new revenue standard and how we previously recognized revenue, and therefore the adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 
 We recognize revenues when it satisfies a performance obligation by transferring control over a product or service to a restaurant guest or other customer. Revenues from restaurant operations are presented net of discounts, coupons, employee meals and complimentary meals and recognized when food, beverage and retail products are sold. Sales tax collected from customers is excluded from sales and the obligation is included in sales tax payable until the taxes are remitted to the appropriate taxing authorities. Catering service revenue is generated through contracts with customers whereby the customer agrees to pay a contract 
 23 

rate for the service. Revenues from catered events are recognized in income upon satisfaction of the performance obligation (the date the event is held) and all customer payments, including nonrefundable upfront deposits, are deferred as a liability until such time. 
 Revenues from gift cards are deferred and recognized upon redemption. Deferrals are not reduced for potential non-use as we generally have a legal obligation to remit the value of unredeemed gift cards to the relevant jurisdictions in which they are sold. 
 Other revenues include purchase service fees which represent commissions earned by a subsidiary of the Company for providing purchasing services to other restaurant groups, as well as license fees, property management fees and other rentals. 
 Use of Estimates 
 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The accounting estimates that require management s most difficult and subjective judgments include allowances for potential bad debts on receivables, the useful lives and recoverability of its assets, such as property and intangibles, fair values of financial instruments and share-based compensation, the realizable value of its tax assets and determining when investment impairments are other-than-temporary. Because of the uncertainty in such estimates, actual results may differ from these estimates. 
 Long-Lived Assets 
 Long-lived assets, such as property, plant and equipment, and purchased intangibles subject to amortization, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. In the evaluation of the fair value and future benefits of long-lived assets, management continually evaluates unfavorable cash flows, if any, related to underperforming restaurants. Periodically it is concluded that certain properties have become impaired based on their existing and anticipated future economic outlook in their respective markets. In such instances, we may impair assets to reduce their carrying values to fair values. Estimated fair values of impaired properties are based on comparable valuations, cash flows and/or management judgment. Management continually evaluates unfavorable cash flows, if any, related to underperforming restaurants. Periodically it is concluded that certain properties have become impaired based on their existing and anticipated future economic outlook in their respective markets. In such instances, we may impair assets to reduce their carrying values to fair values. Estimated fair values of impaired properties are based on comparable valuations, cash flows and/or management's judgment. Included in the year ended October 2, 2021 is an impairment charge of 69,000 related to Clyde Frazier's Wine and Dine. 
 Recoverability of Investment in New Meadowlands Racetrack NMR 
 The carrying value of our investment in Meadowlands Newmark LLC, which has a 63.7 ownership in NMR, is determined using the cost method. In accordance with the cost method, our initial investment is recorded at cost and we record dividend income when applicable, if dividends are declared. We review our investment in NMR each reporting period to determine whether a significant event or change in circumstances has occurred that may have an adverse effect on its fair value. 
 As a result, we performed an assessment of the recoverability of our indirect investment in NMR as of October 2, 2021 which involved critical accounting estimates. These estimates require significant management judgment, include inherent uncertainties and are often interdependent; therefore, they do not change in isolation. Factors that management estimated include, among others, the probability of gambling being approved in northern New Jersey which is the most heavily weighted assumption and NMR obtaining a license to operate a casino, revenue levels, cost of capital, marketing spending, tax rates and capital spending. 
 In performing this assessment, we estimate the fair value of our investment in NMR using our best estimate of these assumptions which we believe would be consistent with what a hypothetical marketplace participant would use. The variability of these factors depends on a number of conditions, including uncertainty about future events and our inability as a minority shareholder to control certain outcomes and thus our accounting estimates may change from period to period. If other assumptions and estimates had been used when these tests were performed, impairment charges could have resulted. 
 As mentioned above, these factors do not change in isolation and, therefore, we do not believe it is practicable or meaningful to present the impact of changing a single factor. Furthermore, if management uses different assumptions or if different conditions occur in future periods, future impairment charges could result.

Leases 
 We determine if an arrangement contains a lease at inception. An arrangement contains a lease if it implicitly or explicitly identifies an asset to be used and conveys the right to control the use of the identified asset in exchange for consideration. As a lessee, we include operating leases in Operating lease right-of-use assets and Operating lease liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet. Right-of-use assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating lease right-of-use assets and liabilities are recognized upon commencement of the lease based on the present value of the lease payments over the lease term. As most of our leases do not provide an implicit interest rate, we use our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date to determine the present value of lease payments. Our lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease. Options are included when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. Lease expense for lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Amendments or modifications to lease terms are accounted for as variable lease payments. Leases with a lease term of 12 months or less are accounted for using the practical expedient which allows for straight-line rent expense over the remaining term of the lease. 
 Deferred Income Tax Valuation Allowance 
 We provide such allowance due to uncertainty that some of the deferred tax amounts may not be realized. Certain items, such as state and local tax loss carryforwards, are dependent on future earnings or the availability of tax strategies. Future results could require an increase or decrease in the valuation allowance and a resulting adjustment to income in such period. 
 Goodwill and Trademarks 
 Goodwill and trademarks are not amortized, but are subject to impairment analysis. We assess the potential impairment of goodwill and trademarks annually (at the end of our fourth quarter) and on an interim basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. If we determine through the impairment review process that goodwill or trademarks are impaired, we record an impairment charge in our consolidated statements of operations. 
 Such impairment analyses for goodwill requires a comparison of the fair value of the Company s equity to the carrying amount of goodwill since the Company operates in one segment. At October 2, 2021 and October 3, 2020, we performed qualitative assessments of factors to determine whether further impairment testing of goodwill was required. Based on this assessment, no impairment losses were warranted at October 2, 2021 and October 3, 2020. Qualitative factors considered in this assessment included industry and market considerations, overall financial performance and other relevant events, management expertise and stability at key positions. Additional impairment analyses at future dates may be performed to determine if indicators of impairment are present, and if so, such amount will be determined and the associated charge will be recorded to the consolidated statements of operations. 
 Our impairment analysis for trademarks consists of a comparison of the fair value to the carrying value of the assets. This comparison is made based on a review of historical, current and forecasted sales and profit levels, as well as a review of any factors that may indicate potential impairment. For the years ended October 2, 2021 and October 3, 2020, our impairment analysis did not result in any other charges related to trademarks. 
 Stock-Based Compensation 
 The Company measures stock-based compensation cost at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and recognizes it as expense over the applicable vesting period using the straight-line method. Excess income tax benefits related to share-based compensation expense that must be recognized directly in equity are considered financing rather than operating cash flow activities. 
 The fair value of each of the Company s stock options is estimated on the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model that uses assumptions that relate to the expected volatility of the Company s common stock, the expected dividend yield of our stock, the expected life of the options and the risk-free interest rate. The Company issues new shares upon the exercise of employee stock options.

 Item 9A. Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 As of October 2, 2021 (the end of the period covered by this report), management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended). Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, at the end of such period, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective and provided reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our periodic SEC filings is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. However, in evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of such possible controls and procedures. 
 Management s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f), and for performing an assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of October 2, 2021. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, our principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by our Board of Directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of assets of the Company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U. S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. 
 Management performed an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of October 2, 2021 based upon the criteria set forth in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the 2013 Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO ). Based on our assessment, management determined that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of October 2, 2021. 
 This Annual Report does not include an attestation report of our independent registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting as management s report was not subject to attestation by our independent registered public accounting firm pursuant to the permanent exemption of the SEC that permits us to provide only management s report in this annual report.

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that occurred during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting. 
 Limitations of the Effectiveness of Internal Control 
 A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the internal control system are met. Because of the inherent limitations of any internal control system, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues, if any, within a company have been detected.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
 To the Board of Directors and Shareholders 
 Ark Restaurants Corp. 
 Opinion on the Financial Statements 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Ark Restaurants Corp. and subsidiaries (the Company as of October 2, 2021 and October 3, 2020 and the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended October 2, 2021, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements ). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of October 2, 2021 and October 3, 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the two years in the two-year period ended October 2, 2021, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
 Basis for Opinion 
 These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) ("PCAOB") and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 
 Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 Critical Audit Matters 
 The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) related to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgements. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. 
 Long-lived Asset Valuation 
 As discussed in Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company utilizes projections of future cash flows to determine if there are indications of impairment of long-lived assets, specifically, land, buildings, equipment and right-of-use assets which totaled 92,510,000 as of October 2, 2021. 
 The Company tests for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset group may not be recoverable. Such indicators may include, among others: a significant decline in future cash flows and changes in expected useful life which relates to the Company s ability and intent to hold its asset groups for a period of time that recovers their carrying value. 
 We identified the valuation of certain long-lived assets to be a critical audit matter. The valuation is based upon undiscounted future cash flows related to certain long-lived assets, specifically, land, buildings, equipment and right-of-use assets. Auditor 
 F-1 

judgments were required to evaluate subjective assumptions in the Company s analysis of undiscounted cash flows. These included estimated future revenue and operating expenses from restaurant locations. Adverse changes in the assumptions could have a significant impact on whether an indicator of impairment has been identified and could have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements. 
 The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We obtained an understanding for the Company s process for determining indicators of impairment of long-lived assets and the Company s evaluation of impairment when indicators arose. We reviewed the minutes of board of director meetings to determine any potential closures of locations that would affect future cash flows and corroborated management s plans with others in the organization who are responsible for, and have authority over, disposition and closure activities. We visited the site of any locations that were considered high risk for potential impairment. We evaluated the reasonableness of the Company s forecasted revenues, operating results and cash flows by performing an independent sensitivity analysis related to the key inputs to forecasted cash flows, including estimated revenue growth rates, margins and operating expenses, to evaluate whether the changes in the assumptions would result in a material change in fair value of related long-lived assets.

 The Company operates restaurants in New York City, in Washington, D.C., in Las Vegas, Nevada, in Atlantic City, New Jersey, in Florida and on the gulf coast of Alabama. The Las Vegas operations include restaurants within the New York-New York Hotel Casino Resort and operation of the hotel s room service, banquet facilities, employee dining room and food court concepts and restaurant within the Planet Hollywood Resort and Casino.

In Alabama, the Company operates Original Oyster Houses , in Gulf Shores and in Spanish Fort. 
 COVID-19 PANDEMIC We are subject to continued risks and uncertainties as a result of the outbreak of, and local, state and federal governmental responses to, the COVID-19 pandemic which was declared a National Public Health Emergency in March 2020. We experienced significant disruptions to our business as suggested and mandated social distancing and shelter-in-place orders led to the temporary closure of all of our restaurants. In the third quarter of fiscal 2020, certain jurisdictions began allowing the reopening of restaurant dining rooms, and we began to reopen dining rooms. While restrictions on the type of permitted operating model and occupancy capacity may continue to change, as of October 2, 2021, all of our restaurants were operating with no indoor dining restrictions. We cannot predict how long the COVID-19 pandemic will last, whether vaccines will be effective at eliminating or slowing the spread of the virus or variants, whether it will reoccur or whether variants will spike, what additional restrictions may be enacted, to what extent we can maintain sales volumes during or following any resumption of mandated social distancing protocols or vaccination or mask mandates and what long-lasting effects the COVID-19 pandemic may have on the restaurant industry as a whole. The ongoing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, including, but not limited to, labor-related impacts, supply chain disruption and consumer behavior, will determine the continued significance of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic to our operating results and financial position.

 for furniture, fixtures and equipment and up to years for buildings and related improvements. Amortization of improvements to leased properties is computed using the straight-line method based upon the initial term of the applicable lease or the estimated useful life of the improvements, whichever is less, and ranges from to years. For leases with renewal periods at the Company s option, if failure to exercise a renewal option imposes an economic penalty to the Company, management may determine at the inception of the lease that renewal is reasonably assured and include the renewal option period in the determination of appropriate estimated useful lives. Routine expenditures for repairs and maintenance are charged to expense when incurred. Major replacements and improvements are capitalized. Upon retirement or disposition of fixed assets, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the consolidated balance sheets and any resulting gain or loss is recognized in the consolidated statements of operations. 
 The Company includes in construction in progress, improvements to restaurants that are under construction or are undergoing substantial renovations. Once the projects have been completed, the Company begins depreciating and amortizing the assets. Start-up costs incurred during the construction period of restaurants, including rental of premises, training and payroll, are expensed as incurred.

and lease liabilities related to our real estate operating leases of . The adoption of this standard did not materially impact retained earnings or our consolidated statement of operations and had no impact on cash flows. 
 In June 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-07, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Non-employee Share-Based Payment Accounting, which simplifies the accounting for share-based payments granted to non-employees for goods and services. Under this ASU, the guidance on share-based payments to non-employees would be aligned with the requirements for share-based payments granted to employees, with certain exceptions. The Company adopted this guidance in the first quarter of fiscal 2020. Such adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 
 In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04, Intangibles Goodwill and Other (Topic 350) Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment ASU 2017-04 ). ASU 2017-04 simplifies the accounting for goodwill impairments by eliminating the requirement to compare the implied fair value of goodwill with its carrying amount as part of step two of the goodwill impairment test referenced in Accounting Standards Codification ASC 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other ASC 350 ). As a result, an entity should perform its annual, or interim, goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. An impairment charge should be recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit s fair value. However, the impairment loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. The Company adopted this guidance in the first quarter of fiscal 2021. Such adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

In exchange, the Company received a interest in Newco, which plans future development of the sites. In addition, all rights and privileges under the current lease were assigned to Newco, as landlord and the lease terms remain unchanged.

 investment in the New Meadowlands Racetrack LLC NMR through its purchase of a membership interest in Meadowlands Newmark, LLC, an existing member of NMR with a then ownership interest. On November 19, 2013, the Company invested an additional in NMR through a purchase of an additional membership interest in Meadowlands Newmark, LLC resulting in a total ownership of of Meadowlands Newmark, LLC, and an effective ownership interest in NMR of , subject to dilution. In 2015, the Company invested an additional in NMR and on February 7, 2017, the Company invested an additional in NMR, both as a result of capital calls, bringing its total investment to with no change in ownership. The Company accounts for this investment at cost, less impairment, adjusted for subsequent observable price changes in accordance with ASU No. 2016-01. There are no observable prices for this investment. 
 Due to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global economy, the Company evaluated its investment in NMR for impairment and concluded that its fair value exceeds the carrying value. Accordingly, the Company did not record any impairment for the years ended October 2, 2021 and October 3, 2020. The ultimate severity and longevity of the COVID-19 pandemic is unknown, and therefore, it is possible that impairments could be identified in future periods, and such amounts could be material. Any future changes in the carrying value of our Investment in NMR will be reflected in earnings. 
 In addition to the Company s ownership interest in NMR through Meadowlands Newmark, LLC, if casino gaming is approved at the Meadowlands and NMR is granted the right to conduct said gaming, neither of which can be assured, the Company shall be granted the exclusive right to operate the food and beverage concessions in the gaming facility with the exception of one restaurant. 
 In conjunction with this investment, the Company, through a owned subsidiary, Ark Meadowlands LLC AM VIE ), also entered into a long-term agreement with NMR for the exclusive right to operate food and beverage concessions serving the new raceway facilities (the Racing F B Concessions located in the new raceway grandstand constructed at the Meadowlands Racetrack in northern New Jersey. Under the agreement, NMR is responsible to pay for the costs and expenses incurred in the operation of the Racing F B Concessions, and all revenues and profits thereof inure to the benefit of NMR. AM VIE receives an annual fee equal to of the net profits received by NMR from the Racing F B Concessions during each calendar year. AM VIE is a variable interest entity; however, based on qualitative consideration of the contracts with AM VIE, the operating structure of AM VIE, the Company s role with AM VIE, and that the Company is not obligated to absorb expected losses of AM VIE, the Company has concluded that it is not the primary beneficiary and not required to consolidate the operations of AM VIE. 
 The Company s maximum exposure to loss as a result of its involvement with AM VIE is limited to a receivable from AM VIE s primary beneficiary (NMR, a related party). As of October 2, 2021 and October 3, 2020, no amounts were due AM VIE by NMR. 
 On April 25, 2014, the Company loaned to Meadowlands Newmark, LLC. The note bears interest at , compounded monthly and added to the principal, and is due in its entirety on January 31, 2024. The note may be prepaid, in whole or in part, at any time without penalty or premium. On July 13, 2016, the Company made an additional loan to Meadowlands Newmark, LLC in the amount of . Such amount is subject to the same terms and conditions as the original loan discussed above. The principal and accrued interest related to this note, after a payment made in July 2021, in the amounts of and , are included in Investment In and Receivable From New Meadowlands Racetrack in the consolidated balance sheets at October 2, 2021 and October 3, 2020, respectively.

 to years and typically include renewal options. Renewal options are recognized as part of the ROU assets and lease liabilities if it is reasonably certain at the date of adoption that we would exercise the options to extend the lease. Our real estate leases typically provide for fixed minimum rent payments and/or contingent rent payments based upon sales in excess of specified thresholds. When the achievement of such sales thresholds are deemed to be probable, variable lease expense is accrued in proportion to the sales recognized during the period. For operating leases that include rent holidays and rent escalation clauses, we recognize lease expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term from the date we take possession of the leased property. We record the straight-line lease expense and any contingent rent, if applicable, in occupancy expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. 
 Many of our real estate leases also require us to pay real estate taxes, common area maintenance costs and other occupancy costs non-lease components which are included in occupancy related expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. Our lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants. 
 As there were no explicit rates provided in our leases, we used our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. 
 During the third quarter of 2020, the Company suspended the vast majority of lease payments while its restaurants were closed by government mandated shutdowns as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Company was able to negotiate rent concessions, abatements and deferrals with landlords on many of our operating leases. In July 2020, the FASB issued a clarification to accounting for lease concessions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic to reduce the operational challenges and complexity of lease accounting. The Company used the relief provisions provided by FASB and made an election to account for the lease concessions as if they were part of the original lease agreement.

 On June 1, 2018, the Company refinanced (the "Refinancing") its then existing indebtedness with its current lender, Bank Hapoalim B.M. BHBM ), by entering into an amended and restated credit agreement (the Revolving Facility ), which was to mature on May 19, 2022 (as extended).

Such note bears interest at LIBOR plus per annum. We expect that the LIBOR rate will be discontinued at some point during 2022 and to work with BHBM to identify a suitable replacement rate and amend our debt agreements to reflect this new reference rate accordingly. We do not expect the discontinuation of LIBOR as a reference rate in our debt agreements to have a material adverse effect on our financial position or materially affect our interest expense. 
 The Revolving Facility, which includes all of the promissory notes, also requires, among other things, that the Company meet minimum quarterly tangible net worth amounts, maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio and meet minimum annual net income amounts. The Revolving Facility contains customary representations, warranties and affirmative covenants as well as customary negative covenants, subject to negotiated exceptions on liens, relating to other indebtedness, capital expenditures, liens, affiliate transactions, disposal of assets and certain changes in ownership. 
 Borrowings under the Revolving Facility are secured by all tangible and intangible personal property (including accounts receivable, inventory, equipment, general intangibles, documents, chattel paper, instruments, letter-of-credit rights, investment property, intellectual property and deposit accounts) and fixtures of the Company. 
 On June 12, 2020 and again on February 15, 2021, as a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, BHBM agreed to modified financial covenants through fiscal Q2 2022. The Company was in compliance with all of its financial covenants under the Revolving Facility as of October 2, 2021.

 Paycheck Protection Program Loans 
 During the year ended October 3, 2020, subsidiaries (the Borrowers of the Company received loan proceeds from several banks (the Lenders in the aggregate amount of (the PPP Loans under the Paycheck Protection Program (the PPP of the CARES Act, which was enacted March 27, 2020. In addition, during the 13 weeks ended April 3, 2021, one of our consolidated VIEs received a second draw PPP Loan in the amount of . The PPP Loans are evidenced by individual promissory notes of each of the Borrowers (together, the Notes in favor of the Lender, which Notes bear interest at the rate of per annum. Funds from the PPP Loans may be used only for payroll and related costs, costs used to continue group health care benefits, mortgage payments, rent, utilities, and interest on other debt obligations that were incurred by a Borrower prior to February 15, 2020 (the Qualifying Expenses ). Under the terms of the PPP Loans, some or all of the amounts thereunder, including accrued interest, may be forgiven if they are used for Qualifying Expenses as described in and in compliance with the CARES Act. Each Note may be prepaid by the respective Borrower at any time prior to maturity with no prepayment penalties. No payments of principal or interest are due under the Notes until the date on which the amount of loan forgiveness (if any) under the CARES Act for each respective Note is remitted to the Lender and a forgiveness decision is received by the Borrower. Forgiveness applications can be submitted up to 10 months after the end of the related notes covered period (which is defined as 24 weeks after the date of the loan) (the Deferral Period and the ultimate forgiveness decisions can be made by the Lenders up to 60 days after submitting the applications and possibly longer if forgiveness is fully or partially denied and the Borrower appeals the decision. While the Company believes that it and each Borrower used the PPP Loan proceeds exclusively for Qualifying Expenses, it is unclear and uncertain whether the conditions for forgiveness of the PPP Loans outstanding at October 2, 2021 will be met under the current guidelines of the CARES Act. Therefore, we cannot make any assurances that the Company, or any of the Borrowers, will be eligible for forgiveness of the remaining PPP Loans, in whole or in part. Accordingly, based on the above, we have classified of the PPP Loans as short-term in the consolidated balance sheet as of October 2, 2021.

To the extent, if any, that any of the remaining PPP Loans are not forgiven, beginning one month following expiration of the Deferral Period, and continuing monthly for 10 months (the Maturity Date ), each respective Borrower is obligated to make monthly payments of principal and interest to the Lender with respect to any unforgiven portion of the Notes, in such equal amounts required to fully amortize the principal amount outstanding on such Notes as of the last day of the applicable Deferral Period by the applicable Maturity Date.

 Legal Proceedings In the ordinary course its business, the Company is a party to various lawsuits arising from accidents at its restaurants and workers compensation claims, which are generally handled by the Company s insurance carriers. The employment by the Company of management personnel, waiters, waitresses and kitchen staff at a number of different restaurants has resulted in the institution, from time to time, of litigation alleging violation by the Company of employment discrimination laws.
