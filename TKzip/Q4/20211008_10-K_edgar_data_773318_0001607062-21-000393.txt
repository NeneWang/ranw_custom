to its mobile banking solutions.

Company
History 

As
a Cardholder Independent Sales Organization, Veritec is able to promote and sell Visa-branded card programs. As a Third-Party Servicer,
Veritec provides back-end cardholder transaction processing services for Visa-branded card programs on behalf of its sponsoring bank.
Veritec has a portfolio of five United States and eight foreign patents. In addition, we have seven U.S. and twenty-eight foreign
pending patent applications. Veritec has had agreements with various banks in the past and is currently seeking a bank to sponsor its
Prepaid Card programs. 

Our
Products and Solutions 

The
Company believes that its Mobile Banking Technology platform and its blinx On-Off debit card and blinxPay mobile wallet
programs are a significant advance in mobile banking and close loop/open loop debit technology and is capable of bringing significant
value to card issuing and sponsoring organizations, whether they be commercial or government. 

(a)
 MTC Debit Card - Visa Prepaid Card Programs 

In
fiscal year 2009, the Company announced the release of its Mobile Toggle Card (MTC Program on the Company s mobile banking
software platform under a sponsoring bank. Veritec s mobile banking software platform is a debit based, pre-paid and gift card
solution that is licensed by Veritec s wholly owned subsidiary, Veritec Financial Systems, Inc., to debit card issuers and sponsoring
organizations. Under the MTC Program, card issuers and sponsors may provide the MTC branded debit or gift cards to individuals
with and without demand deposit accounts (e.g., the latter the under-banked ). The MTC card may be part of a Visa 
branded program and, as such, the cards are accepted anywhere in the world that Visa cards are accepted. 

With
an MTC card, the cardholders are empowered to combat unpermitted and fraudulent use of their debit cards by toggling 
their cards on and off with their mobile phones. Cardholders no longer have to completely rely on their card
issuers to monitor possible fraudulent activity on their accounts. Cardholders can now de-activate their cards themselves, in real-time,
any time they choose to do so. In addition to this toggling feature, cardholders may apply for their cards online, arrange for direct
deposits to be made to their cards, and transfer money to their card from another account. Cardholders may also elect to receive various
alerts on their mobile phones about activity on their card. In the fiscal year 2010, the Company began accepting applications for the
MTC card from individual applicants and issuing live Visa branded debit cards under the MTC Mobile Toggle Card Program. 

1 

(b)
 blinx ON-OFF Debit Card - Visa Prepaid Card Programs 

In
fiscal year 2011, Veritec began marketing the blinx ON-OFF branded card under a bank sponsorship. The blinx ON-OFF card
is based on the Mobile Banking Technology platform and offers the same features and functions as the MTC branded card but with
different pricing for bank-sponsored cards. 

(c)
 Custom Branded Debit Card Programs 

In
addition to the MTC and blinx ON-OFF branded program, the Company enables card issuers and sponsors to issue debit, pre-paid
and gift cards under their own branded programs through licensed use of the mobile banking platform and the Company s provision
of related professional services. 

(d)
 blinxPay Mobile Wallet App 

The
Company released its blinxPay mobile wallet application during fiscal year 2016. blinxPay is a secure payment processing
system and mobile app that enables customers to make purchases at participating merchants using funds loaded into their blinxPay 
virtual account. The blinxPay mobile app is available for download for free at both Google Pay and Apple iTunes stores. 

Veritec s
mobile banking solution also enables member card programs to be processed and settled member rewards to its members in either an open
or closed loop processing environment. In addition to its front-end licensing and professional services, the Company also provides back-end
card processing services to the card issuing institutions for all cardholder transactions on the licensed platform. The Company s
Mobile Banking Technology resides within a Payment Card Industry (PCI) compliant data processing center. 

Intellectual
Property Rights 

The
Company was founded upon its intellectual property on its belief that its intellectual property will give the Company a commercial advantage
in the global marketplace. The Company relies on patent, trade secret, copyright and trademark law, as well as the company s contractual
terms with its customers, to define, maintain and enforce the Company s intellectual property rights in its Mobile Banking Technology
and other technologies and relationships. 

The
Company has a portfolio of seven United States and eight foreign patents. In addition, we have three U.S. and eight foreign
pending patent applications. 

A
significant amount of the Company s intellectual property takes the form of trade secrets and copyrighted works of authorship.
The Company treats the source code to its Mobile Banking Technology as trade secrets, and its licensed software applications are copyrightable
subject matter. 

We
have a portfolio of registered and pending trademarks in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions, including registrations for the marks
 VSCode and VeriCode . The Company uses Veritec as a trademark and service mark, as
well as serving as the Company s trade name. 

Major
Customers 

During
the year ended June 30, 2021, and 2020, the Company had one customer, a related party that represented 76 and 77 of our revenues, respectively.
No other customer represented more than 10 of our revenues. 

Competition 

Our
Mobile Banking Technology competes with other independent sales organizations and third party services of Visa-branded card programs,
including TransCash Corporation, Ready Debit Card by MetaBank, Millenium Advantage Card by New Millenium Bank, and Wired Plastic by Bancorp
Bank. The Company believes, however, that there are very few companies that have the Company s collective attributes of (1) being
an independent sales organization of Visa-branded and non-branded prepaid card programs, (2) being a third party servicer (e.g., back
end processor) for banks issuing Visa-branded and non-branded prepaid card programs, (3) being the developer, marketer and licensor of
the mobile banking platform on which Visa-branded and non-branded card program cardholder transactions take place, and (4) having a mobile
banking platform that enables real-time transaction processing and enabling cardholders to manage their accounts by enabling cardholders
to toggle their cards and their website accounts on and off via their mobile phones.

3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 

On

in prior years was also issued 500,000 shares of common stock for services. The Company alleged that the individual used the Company's
intellectual property without approval. Under the terms of the settlement agreement, the individual agreed to relinquish a convertible
note payable and unpaid interest aggregating 364,686 and return 500,000 shares of common stock previously issued to him. In turn, the
Company agreed to release and discharge the individual against all claims arising on or prior to the date of the settlement agreement.
As of June 30, 2021, the 500,000 shares have not been relinquished. When the Company receives the shares, it will record a cancellation

ITEM
7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OR PLAN OF OPERATION 

The
following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated
financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve
risks, uncertainties, and assumptions. See Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements. Our actual results could differ materially
from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors discussed elsewhere in this report. 

The
following discussion and analysis of the Company s financial condition and results of operations is based on the preparation of
our financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. You should read this discussion and analysis
together with such financial statements and the related notes thereto. 

COVID-19
Considerations 

The
Company is subject to risks and uncertainties as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic
on the Company s business is highly uncertain and difficult to predict, as the responses that the Company, other businesses and
governments are taking continue to evolve. Furthermore, capital markets and economies worldwide have also been negatively impacted by
the COVID-19 pandemic, and it is possible that the COVID-19 pandemic could cause a local, national and/or global economic recession.
Policymakers around the globe have responded with fiscal policy actions to support the economy as a whole, but it is presently unknown
whether and to what extent further fiscal actions will continue. The magnitude and overall effectiveness of these actions remain uncertain. 

The
Company believes that its Mobile Banking revenues have been negatively affected due to the reduction in customer spending, which negatively
impacts the amount of fees earned by the Company from its customers. The Company is also currently experiencing a decline in revenues
earned under the management services agreement with The Matthews Group, as The Matthews Group s customer orders have been negatively
impacted by the effects of COVID-19. The severity of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company s business will continue
to depend on a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the duration and severity of the pandemic and the extent and severity
of the impact on the Company s customers, service providers and suppliers, all of which are uncertain and cannot be predicted.
As of the date of issuance of the Company s financial statements, the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic may in the future materially
impact the Company s financial condition, liquidity or results of operations is uncertain.

Mobile banking technology 

Mobile
Banking Technology revenues include products such as the Company s Blinx On-Off prepaid toggle Card and its Open Loop/Close
Loop System and Bio ID Card Platform. Mobile Banking Technology uses web-based mobile technology to offer financial cardholders the very
best technology in conducting secure financial transactions in real time, protecting personal identity, and financial account security.
Mobile Banking Technology revenues for the years ended June 30, 2021, and 2020 were 93,000 and 100,000, respectively. The decrease
in Mobile Banking Technology revenues was due to both the conclusion of certain long term contracts during the prior year and the Company
not having a bank to sponsor its mobile banking solutions since fiscal year 2016. 

Other revenue, management fee - related party 

On
December 31, 2015, the Company sold all of its assets of its Barcode Technology, which was comprised solely of its intellectual property,
to The Matthews Group, a related party. The Company subsequently entered into a management services agreement with The Matthews Group
to manage all facets of the barcode technology operations through June 30, 2022. The Company earns a fee of 35 of all revenues billed
up to June 30, 2022, and recognizes management fee revenue as services are performed. For the years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020,
revenue earned from the management services agreement was 296,000 and 338,000, respectively. 

Cost
of Sales 

Cost
of sales for the years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020 totaled 222,000 and 210,000, respectively. 

Operating
Expenses 

General
and administrative expenses for the years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020 totaled 861,000 and 630,000, respectively. The increase in general
and administrative expenses was primarily due to increased legal and professional fees as compared to the same period of the prior year. 

Other
Income (Expenses) 

On
July 10, 2019, the Company and Plaintiffs entered into a Confidential Settlement Agreement and Mutual Release, whereas, both the Company
and the Plaintiffs agreed to generally discharge and forever release each other from future claims, to pay their own legal fees, and
the promissory note payable to the Plaintiffs was discharged (see Note 4 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements). During
the twelve months ended June 30, 2020, the Company recorded a gain on extinguishment of convertible note payable of 167,000. 

Interest
expense for the twelve months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, was 397,000 and 341,000, respectively. The increase was due to the increase
in our notes payable balance. 

Net
Loss 

We
had a net loss of 1,091,000 for the year ended June 30, 2021, compared to a net loss of 576,000 for the year ended June 30, 2020. 

6 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

Our
cash balance on June 30, 2021 increased to 238,000 as compared to 228,000 on June 30, 2020. The increase was the result of the 682,000
cash provided by financing activities offset by 672,000 cash used in operating activities . Net cash used in operations during the period
ended June 30, 2021, was 672,000, compared with 380,000 of net cash used in operations during the same period of the prior year. Cash
used in operations during the period ended June 30, 2021, was primarily from our net loss of 1,091,000, offset by an increase in interest
accrued on notes payable of 397,000, common stock issued for services of 10,000, and general changes to our working capital accounts
of 12,000. Net cash provided by financing activities of 682,000 during the period ended June 30, 2021, was due to proceeds received
of 118,000 from SBA PPP loans payable, and proceeds received of 564,000 from notes payable. During the same period of the prior year,
net cash provided by financing activities of 517,000 was from proceeds received from notes payable. 

The
accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates
the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. During the year ended June 30, 2021, the
Company incurred a loss of 1,091,000 and used cash in operating activities of 672,000, and at June 30, 2021, the Company had a stockholders 
deficiency of 6,930,000. In addition, as of June 30, 2021, the Company is in default on 710,000 of its notes payable. These factors,
among others, raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern within one year of the date that the financial
statements are issued. In addition, the Company s independent registered public accounting firm, in its report on our June 30,
2021 financial statements, has raised substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The Company s
financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty be necessary should we be
unable to continue as a going concern. 

The
Company believes its cash and forecasted cash flow from operations will not be sufficient to continue operations through fiscal 2022
without continued external investment. The Company believes it will require additional funds to continue its operations through fiscal
2022 and to continue to develop its existing projects and plans to raise such funds by finding additional investors to purchase the Company s
securities, generating sufficient sales revenue, implementing dramatic cost reductions or any combination thereof. There is no assurance
that the Company can be successful in raising such funds, generating the necessary sales or reducing major costs. Further, if the Company
is successful in raising such funds from sales of equity securities, the terms of these sales may cause significant dilution to existing
holders of common stock. 

The
Company has traditionally been dependent on The Matthews Group, LLC, a related party, for its financial support. The Matthews Group is
owned 50 by Van Tran, the Company s CEO/Executive Chair and a director, and 50 by Lawrence J. Johanns, a significant Company
stockholder.

Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates 

Management s
discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements, which have been prepared
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires
management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates, including those related to
impairment of long-lived assets, including finite lived intangible assets, accrued liabilities, fair value of warrant derivatives and
certain expenses. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under
the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that
are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or
conditions. 

Our
significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1 to our financial statements. The preparation of financial statements
in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses, and the related disclosures of contingent
assets and liabilities. Actual results could differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 

Stock-Based
Compensation 

The
Company periodically issues stock-based compensation to officers, directors, contractors and consultants for services rendered. Such
issuances vest and expire according to terms established at the issuance date. 

9 

Stock-based
payments to officers, directors, employees, and for acquiring goods and services from nonemployees, which include grants of employee
stock options, are recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values in accordance with Topic 718. Stock option grants,
which are generally time vested, will be measured at the grant date fair value and charged to operations on a straight-line basis over
the vesting period. The fair value of stock options is determined utilizing the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which is affected
by several variables, including the risk-free interest rate, the expected dividend yield, the expected life of the equity award, the
exercise price of the stock option as compared to the fair market value of the common stock on the grant date and the estimated volatility
of the common stock over the term of the equity award. 

Revenue
Recognition 

Revenues
for the Company are classified into mobile banking technology and management fee revenue. 

a.
Mobile Banking Revenue 

The
Company, as a merchant payment processor and a distributor, recognizes revenue from transaction fees charged to cardholders for the use
of its issued mobile debit cards. The fees are recognized on a monthly basis after all cardholder transactions have been summarized and
reconciled with third party processors. 

b.
Other revenue, management fee - related party 

On
September 30, 2015, the Company sold all of its assets of its Barcode Technology comprised solely of its intellectual property to The
Matthews Group and entered into a management services agreement with The Matthews Group to manage all facets of the barcode technology
operations, on behalf of The Matthews Group, through June 30, 2022. The Company earned a fee of 35 of all revenues billed up to June
30, 2021.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting
Firm 

Board of Directors and Stockholders 

 Veritec, Inc. 

 Golden Valley, Minnesota 

Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements 

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance
sheets of Veritec, Inc. (the Company and subsidiaries as of June 30, 2021 and 2020, the related consolidated statements
of operations, stockholders deficiency, and cash flows for the years then ended, and the related notes (collectively referred to
as the consolidated financial statements ). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of the Company and its subsidiary as of June 30, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations
and its cash flows for the years then ended , in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America. 

Going Concern 

The accompanying consolidated financial statements
have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements,
the Company has had recurring losses from operations and had a stockholders deficiency as of June 30, 2021. These conditions raise
substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. Management s plans in regard to these matters
are also described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements. The accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include
any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

Basis for Opinion 

These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility
of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s consolidated financial statements
based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable
rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards
of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated
financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we
engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding
of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s
internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our audits included performing procedures to assess
the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures
that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the
consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide
a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

Critical audit matter 

The critical audit matter communicated below is a
matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit
committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially
challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion
on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing separate opinions
on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. 

Revenue recognition Revenue from Related
Party 

As described in Note 9 to the consolidated financial
statements, the Company has entered into a management services agreement (the Agreement with The Matthews Group (TMG),
to manage all facets of their barcode technology operations through June 30, 2022. The Matthews Group (TMG) is owned 50 by Ms. Tran,
the Company s CEO/Executive Chair and a director, and 50 by Larry Johanns, a significant stockholder of the Company. Pursuant to
the Agreement, the Company earns a fee of 35 of all revenues billed up by TMG to its customers. The Company recognizes management fee
revenue as services are performed by TMG. Management fee revenue from the Agreement represented approximately 76 of the Company s
total revenue for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021. 

We identified the Company s recording of revenue
as a critical audit matter because of the complexity involved in the recognition of such revenue, in particular given its related party
nature. In turn, the auditing of revenue from related party required a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing
audit procedures and evaluating the results of those procedures to ensure revenue has been properly recorded. 

The primary procedures we performed to
address this critical audit matter included: 

We obtained and evaluated documentation
prepared by management which outlines the Company s revenue recognition policies and their processes to determine the revenue to
be recognized from TMG sales pursuant to the underlying agreements and current accounting guidelines. 

We evaluated whether the Company s
conclusion in such documentation was consistent with relevant accounting standards. 

We obtained a schedule of all
revenue recognized by TMG and reconciled the recorded revenue to the underlying accounting records. 

We selected a sample of revenue
transactions recorded by TMG and performed detail testing including the following for each selection: 

r Obtained evidence of a contract
with the customer; 

r Compared the amounts recognized
and timing of revenue recognition to underlying source documents such as invoices, form of payments, and executed contracts and related
modifications, if any; 

r Evaluated the Company s
application of their accounting policies to determine the timing and amount recognized; and 

r For each sample tested, we recalculated
the Company s share of revenue based upon the terms of the agreement and reconciled to the Company s accounting records. 

We read and evaluated management s
disclosure of the nature of the transaction and identification as related party transaction

factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern within one year of the date that the
financial statements are issued. The Company s financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome

The
Company believes it will require additional funds to continue its operations through fiscal 2022 and to continue to develop its existing
projects and plans to raise such funds by finding additional investors to purchase the Company s securities, generating sufficient
sales revenue, implementing dramatic cost reductions or any combination thereof. There is no assurance that the Company can be successful
in raising such funds, generating the necessary sales or reducing major costs. Further, if the Company is successful in raising such
funds from sales of equity securities, the terms of these sales may cause significant dilution to existing holders of common stock. The
consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that may result from this uncertainty.

June 30, 2021 and 2020, there was no net profit derived from the acquired assets, and the Company had not yet received the required equity

Administration (SBA). The PPP loan is payable monthly commencing 6 months after the end of the covered period, which ends in September
2021. In accordance with the PPP Flexibility Act, if the Company applies for loan forgiveness within 10 months after the end of the covered
period, then no payments are due until the SBA remits payment of a forgiveness amount or determines that no forgiveness is authorized.
If the Company does not submit a request for forgiveness within 10 months after the end of the covered period, the Company will begin
making payments on the PPP loan. 

Funds
from the PPP loan may only be used for qualifying expenses as described in the CARES Act, including qualifying payroll costs, qualifying
group health care benefits, qualifying rent and debt obligations, and qualifying utilities. The Company intends to use the entire loan
amount for qualifying expenses. Under the terms of the PPP, certain amounts of the loan may be forgiven if they are used for qualifying
expenses. The Company intends to apply for forgiveness of the PPP loan with respect to these qualifying expenses, however, we cannot
assure that such forgiveness of any portion of the PPP loan will occur. As for the potential loan forgiveness, once the PPP loan is,
in part or wholly, forgiven and a legal release is received, the liability would be reduced by the amount forgiven and a gain on extinguishment
would be recorded. The terms of the PPP loan provide for customary events of default including, among other things, payment defaults,
breach of representations and warranties, and insolvency events.

Company has provided a valuation allowance on the deferred tax assets at June 30, 2021 and 2020 to reduce such asset to zero, since there

expires in varying amounts through 2041. The ability to utilize the net operating loss carryforwards could be limited by Section 382

The Company is subject to examination by tax authorities for all years for which a loss carryforward is utilized in subsequent periods. 

The
Company follows FASB guidelines that address the determination of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return
should be recorded in the financial statements. Under this guidance, we may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position
only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical
merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the
largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. This guidance also provides
guidance on derecognition, classification, interest, and penalties on income taxes, accounting in interim periods and requires increased
disclosures. As of June 30, 2021 and 2020, the Company did not have a liability for unrecognized tax benefits, and no adjustment was
required at adoption. 

The
Company s policy is to record interest and penalties on uncertain tax provisions as income tax expense. As of June 30, 2021 and
2020, the Company has no accrued interest or penalties related to uncertain tax positions.

ITEM
9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation
of disclosure controls and procedures 

Based
upon an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures performed by our Chief Executive Officer as of the
end of the period covered by this report, our Chief Executive Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures have not
been effective as a result of a weakness in the design of internal control over financial reporting identified below. 

As
used herein, disclosure controls and procedures mean controls and other procedures of our company that are designed to
ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Commission s rules and forms. Disclosure controls
and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us
in the reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including
our principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure. 

Management s
Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

Management
is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange
Act Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Our Chief Executive Officer/Chief Accounting Officer conducted an evaluation
of the effectiveness of our control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by
the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO ). Based on management s evaluation under
the framework, management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of June 30, 2021. 

We
identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting primarily attributable to (i) lack of segregation of
incompatible duties; and (ii) insufficient Board of Directors representation. These weaknesses are due to our inadequate staffing during
the period covered by this report and our lack of working capital to hire additional staff. Management has retained an outside, independent
financial consultant to record and review all financial data, as well as prepare our financial reports, in order to mitigate this weakness.
Although management will periodically re-evaluate this situation, at this point it considers that the risk associated with such lack
of segregation of duties and the potential benefits of adding employees to segregate such duties are not cost-justified. We intend to
hire additional accounting personnel to assist with financial reporting as soon as our finances will allow. 

This
annual report does not include an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial
reporting. Management s report was not subject to attestation by our registered public accounting firm pursuant to temporary rules
of the Securities and Exchange Commission that permit us to provide only management s report in this annual report. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

No
changes in our internal control over financial reporting occurred during the year ended June 30, 2021, that have materially affected,
or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
