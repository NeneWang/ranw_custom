Business
Overview 

MU
Global is a beauty and wellness company, providing SPA and wellness service and also SPA related products to the customers. The services
provided are designed to improve the overall health system and body function. 

Since
our establishment, the Company has been focusing to expand in the Chinese market, with other country also under consideration as target
destinations. As an emerging industry in China, the beauty and wellness industry is still in the early stage there is a huge potential
for the industry to growth significantly. 

In
year 2020, COVID-19 crisis has resulted the sales of the global beauty and wellness industry weak due to consumers have had limited
access to retail outlets and supply chain bottlenecks have reduced product availability. In China, the industry s sales fell up
to 80 percent compared with 2019. Nevertheless, based on Mckinsey and Company research report on April 8, 2021, shows that consumers
care deeply about wellness and that their interest is growing and the global wellness market is estimated at more than US 1.5
trillion, with annual growth of 5 to 10 percent. A rise in both consumer interest and purchasing power presents tremendous opportunities
for companies, particularly as spending on personal wellness rebounds after stagnating or even declining during the COVID-19 crisis 

China
has large territory, population, diverse ethnicity and cultural background. As such, it has resulted in different consumer orientations
in different cities and townships across the country, therefore, it is particularly challenging to tackle the consumer market with a
single business model. 

The
advance in technological development and rise in use of technology in marketing has also intensified the competition, probing the Company
to develop the business models that allow quick penetration and huge coverage of different markets, and also being able to cope with
the swift changes in the consumer market. Thus, the Company is focusing on three key areas as part of the Company s early development
in the Chinese market. 

The
first and most key focus is to enter the regional market through the adoption of franchisee and agent model, which the other parties
are familiar and have deep understanding in the local market, hence its operating strategy is effective and best suited the targeted
region. 

2 

Second,
the key strategy is to ensure rapid development of the Omni channel marketing plan which targets to lease out at least ten thousand Stone
Spa Bed (Hot Stone Bath equipment), reducing the time cost for the development of project, and most importantly, working on to spur sales
and revenue growth. 

Lastly,
the essential requirement for business success in the Chinese market is to ensure and maintain a clear and transparent business model,
which would result in effective collaboration between the company and its agent/franchisee, and consequently leads to efficient market
operation and a win-win situation between the two parties. 

Currently,
the Company operates in the Chinese market with three business models: 

1. 
 Tripartite
 co-operation and profit sharing model (deployment of stone spa bed franchise) 

2. 
 Large-scale
 chain agent model (deployment of stone spa bed) 

3.
 
 Direct-
 service store model

MORE STONE THERAPHY 

1. 
 Bedrock
 Bathing/ Hot Stone Bath 

3 

Bedrock
Bathing is a method of keeping the body in shape that involves bathers lying down on a heated slab of rocks embedded on a spa treatment
bed without using hot water wearing indoor clothing. The original name for this hot stone bathing is Ganban yoku ,
and it is originated from Japan as the term for a popular form of hot stone or bedrock spa. It is also referred to as stone-bathing ,
but there is no actual bathing or water involved. 

It
is our belief that the effects of bedrock bathing are numerous and both aesthetic and metabolic. Furthermore, the rocks selected for
this treatment are believed to provide many health benefits when they are heated. The five stones we intend to use are: Black Silica
Stone, Radium Stone, Far Infrared Stone, Negative Ion Stone and Beitou Stone. The average time taken for each therapy is approximately
30 minutes. 

The
Company believes that bedrock bathing treatments will assist in the elimination of suboptimal health conditions caused by polluted environments,
unhealthy dietary intake, and unhealthy lifestyles. The detoxification process will improve general bodily function and immune system,
promote blood circulation, and yield visible skin improvement. The treatment is also believed to improve basal metabolism, resulting
in more efficient energy utilization within the body, hence sustainable weight loss to a desirable level. Prolonged proper treatments
have also been linked to miscellaneous anti-aging benefits. 

Our
pricing strategy offers great flexibility to our customers to opt for the service they desire which is also within their budget. In order
to ensure flexibility, the Company has divided the service into three different tiers, each with different pricing strategy: Flagship,
Luxury and Refined. Under the three tiers model, Flagship branch and will be the top tier and will target high-end segment with premium
pricing packages. Luxury branch is designed to attract middle class individuals. Refined branch on the other side, will aim to attract
customer with lower budget, but would still like to enjoy the service. 

The
Company started offering bedrock bathing services in the Shanghai outlet in January 2019. Different service packages are designed for
each tier of service, which include option for subscription-based treatments, and pay per services. The packages offer customers either
the option of purchasing our treatments at a discounted price if they purchase in bundle, or they can pay for the service every time
they use at normal price. The bundle comprises of 3 different number of visits per bundle i.e., 10 times visit package,
20 times visit package, and 30 times visit package. We have also implemented a member database for our bedrock bathing centre. Customers
can join our membership at an attracting fee to enjoy the services provided at member price. In addition to that, the Company also allows
customers to purchase the services package via online and WeChat.

The
setting displays a concept of thermostatic control for a stone spa bed, which includes a bed, a bed heating element, an energy part,
a cover cabin, cover cabin s opening/closing assembly, a thermostatic control device, and a thermostatic temperature adjustment
device. Once the thermostatic temperature adjustment device sets the default temperature, the user can activate the bed heating element
after lying down on the stone spa bed. Following the closure of the cover cabin, the bed heating element will start heating from the
default temperature to the user s ideal degree of temperature. Once the session completes, the thermostatic control device will
reduce the heating efficiency to the default temperature in order to maintain the heat for the next session, which can largely reduce
the heating time and electricity cost-saving.

it has built a stronghold with the franchised stores and agents in multiple provinces across the country, including Shanghai, Zhejiang,
Jiangsu, Sichuan, Shandong, Shanxi, Henan and Guangdong province. The initial expansion of operation is based on the business model of
profit sharing, and through this model, the Company has managed to expand the Hot Stone Bath therapy service into different health and
wellness service provider outlets in different cities. The outlets span across different sub-segment of the health and wellness industry,
which include beauty centre, post-maternity care centre, as well as high-end beauty salon. The Company targets to achieve the Omni-channel

model in this industry, the information and intelligent technology has thus become the core competency in successfully managing large-scale
change industries

local counterpart to develop and promote the Omni channel marketing project. At the same time, the Company has already established the
national agency network in Malaysia and Singapore, and we are aiming to further expand to other countries in the Association of Southeast
Asian Nations (ASEAN). 

Human
Resources and Talent Development

into consideration of aforementioned development, the Company is well aware that with existing man power is far from sufficient to materialization
of future plan, thus investment in human resources and talent development is inevitable, including but it will not be limited to internal

Penny
Stock Regulations 

The
Securities and Exchange Commission has adopted regulations which generally define penny stock to be an equity security
that has a market price of less than 5.00 per share. Our Common Stock, when and if a trading market develops, may fall within the definition
of penny stock and be subject to rules that impose additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers who sell such securities
to persons other than established customers and accredited investors (generally those with assets in excess of 1,000,000, or annual
incomes exceeding 200,000 individually, or 300,000, together with their spouse). 

For
transactions covered by these rules, the broker-dealer must make a special suitability determination for the purchase of such securities
and have received the purchaser s prior written consent to the transaction. Additionally, for any transaction, other than exempt
transactions, involving a penny stock, the rules require the delivery, prior to the transaction, of a risk disclosure document mandated
by the Securities and Exchange Commission relating to the penny stock market. The broker-dealer also must disclose the commissions payable
to both the broker-dealer and the registered representative, current quotations for the securities and, if the broker-dealer is the sole
market-maker, the broker-dealer must disclose this fact and the broker-dealer s presumed control over the market. Finally, monthly
statements must be sent disclosing recent price information for the penny stock held in the account and information on the limited market
in penny stocks. Consequently, the penny stock rules may restrict the ability of broker-dealers to sell our Common Stock
and may affect the ability of investors to sell their Common Stock in the secondary market. 

In
addition to the penny stock rules promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Financial Industry Regulatory
Authority FINRA has adopted rules that require that in recommending an investment to a customer, a broker-dealer must
have reasonable grounds for believing that the investment is suitable for that customer. Prior to recommending speculative low-priced
securities to their non-institutional customers, broker-dealers must make reasonable efforts to obtain information about the customer s
financial status, tax status, investment objectives and other information. Under interpretations of these rules, FINRA believes that
there is a high probability that speculative low-priced securities will not be suitable for at least some customers. The FINRA requirements
make it more difficult for broker-dealers to recommend that their customers buy our common stock, which may limit the investors 
ability to buy and sell our stock. 

Dividend
Policy 

Any
future determination as to the declaration and payment of dividends on shares of our Common Stock will be made at the discretion of our
board of directors out of funds legally available for such purpose. We are under no obligations or restrictions to declare or pay dividends
on our shares of Common Stock. In addition, we currently have no plans to pay such dividends. Our board of directors currently intends
to retain all earnings for use in the business for the foreseeable future.

Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates 

Use
of estimates 

Management
uses estimates and assumptions in preparing these financial statements in accordance with US GAAP. Those estimates and assumptions affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in the balance sheets, and the reported
revenue and expenses during the periods reported. Actual results may differ from these estimates. 

Cash
and cash equivalents 

Cash
and cash equivalents are carried at cost and represent cash on hand, demand deposits placed with banks or other financial institutions
and all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less as of the purchase date of such investments. 

18 

Revenue
recognition 

Financial
Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued ASC 606. The standard is a comprehensive new revenue recognition model that requires revenue
to be recognized in a manner to depict the transfer of goods or services to a customer at an amount that reflects the consideration expected
to be received in exchange for those goods or services. 

Revenue
is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, net of discounts and taxes applicable to the revenue. The
Company derives its revenue from provision of wellness and beauty services to customers via Company owned outlets, franchised outlets
or distribution of our product to third party wellness and beauty salon. 

Cost
of revenues 

Cost
of revenue includes the cost of services and product incurred to provide wellness and beauty services and purchase of products. 

Cash
and cash equivalents 

Cash
and cash equivalents are carried at cost and represent cash on hand, demand deposits placed with banks or other financial institutions
and all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less as of the purchase date of such investments. 

Inventories 

Inventories
consisting of products available for sell, are stated at the lower of cost or market value. Cost of inventory is determined using the
first-in, first-out (FIFO) method. Inventory reserve is recorded to write down the cost of inventory to the estimated market value due
to slow-moving merchandise and damaged goods, which is dependent upon factors such as historical and forecasted consumer demand, and
promotional environment. The Company takes ownership, risks and rewards of the products purchased. Write downs are recorded in cost of
revenues in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss. 

Property,
plant and equipment 

Property,
plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, if any. Depreciation is calculated
on the straight-line basis over the following expected useful lives from the date on which they become fully operational: 

Classification 
 
 Estimated
 useful life 
 
 Leasable
 equipment 
 
 5
 years 
 
 Computer
 hardware and software 
 
 3
 years 
 
 Office
 equipment 
 
 3
 years 

Expenditures
for maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. The gain or loss on the disposal of property, plant and equipment is the difference
between the net sale proceeds and the carrying amount of the relevant assets and is recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations
and Comprehensive Loss. 

Impairment
of long-live assets 

Long-lived
assets primarily include trademark of the Company. In accordance with the provision of ASC Topic 360, Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived
Assets , the Company generally conducts its annual impairment evaluation to its long-lived assets, usually in the fourth quarter of
each fiscal year, or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist, such as significant sustained change in the business climate.
The recoverability of long-lived assets is measured at the lowest level group. If the total of the expected undiscounted future net cash
flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset, a loss is recognized for the difference between the fair value and carrying amount
of the asset. There has been no impairment charge for the years presented. 

19 

Leases 

Prior
to November 1, 2019, the Company accounted for leases under ASC 840, Accounting for Leases . Effective November 1, 2019, the Company
adopted the guidance of ASC 842, Leases , which requires an entity to recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for
virtually all leases. The implementation of ASC 842 did not have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements
and did not have a significant impact on our liquidity. The Company adopted ASC 842 using a modified retrospective approach. As a result,
the comparative financial information has not been updated and the required disclosures prior to the date of adoption have not been updated
and continue to be reported under the accounting standards in effect for those periods. 

Income
taxes 

Income
taxes are determined in accordance with the provisions of ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes ASC Topic 740 ).
Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between
the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. Deferred tax assets and liabilities
are measured using enacted income tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the periods in which those temporary differences are
expected to be recovered or settled. Any effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income
in the period that includes the enactment date. 

ASC
740 prescribes a comprehensive model for how companies should recognize, measure, present, and disclose in their financial statements
uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return. Under ASC 740, tax positions must initially be recognized in the
financial statements when it is more likely than not the position will be sustained upon examination by the tax authorities. Such tax
positions must initially and subsequently be measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of
being realized upon ultimate settlement with the tax authority assuming full knowledge of the position and relevant facts. 

The
Company conducts major businesses in China and is subject to tax in this jurisdiction. As a result of its business activities, the Company
will file tax returns that are subject to examination by the foreign tax authority. 

Going
concern 

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared using the going concern basis of accounting, which contemplates the realization
of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. 

For
the year ended July 31, 2021, the Company has generated revenue of 64,951 and continuously incurred a net loss of 386,944. As
of July 31, 2021, the Company suffered an accumulated deficit of 2,031,848. The Company s ability to continue as a going
concern is dependent upon improving the profitability and the continuing financial support from its stockholders. Management believes
the existing shareholders or external financing will provide the additional cash to meet the Company s obligations as they become
due. 

These
and other factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. These financial statements
do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts
and classification of liabilities that may result in the Company not being able to continue as a going concern 

20 

Net
loss per share 

The
Company calculates net loss per share in accordance with ASC Topic 260 Earnings Per Share . Basic loss per share is computed
by dividing the net loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted loss per share is computed
similar to basic loss per share except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional common shares that would
have been outstanding if the potential common stock equivalents had been issued and if the additional common shares were dilutive. 

Foreign
currencies translation 

Transactions
denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rates prevailing
at the dates of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are translated
into the functional currency using the applicable exchange rates at the balance sheet dates. The resulting exchange differences are recorded
in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss. 

The
reporting currency of the Company and its subsidiary is United States Dollars US and the accompanying financial statements
have been expressed in US . 

In
general, for consolidation purposes, assets and liabilities of its subsidiary whose functional currency is not US are translated into
US , in accordance with ASC Topic 830-30, Translation of Financial Statement , using the exchange rate on the balance sheet
date. Revenues and expenses are translated at average rates prevailing during the period. The gains and losses resulting from translation
of financial statements of foreign subsidiary are recorded as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive loss within the
statements of shareholders equity. 

Translation
of amounts from RMB, TWD and HK into US 1 has been made at the following exchange rates for the respective periods:

Related
parties 

Parties,
which can be a corporation or individual, are considered to be related if the Company has the ability, directly or indirectly, to control
the other party or exercise significant influence over the other party in making financial and operating decisions. Companies are also
considered to be related if they are subject to common control or common significant influence. 

Fair
value of financial instruments: 

The
carrying value of the Company s financial instruments: cash and cash equivalents, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, and
amount due to a director approximate at their fair values because of the short-term nature of these financial instruments. 

The
Company also follows the guidance of the ASC Topic 820-10, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures ASC 820-10 ),
with respect to financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value. ASC 820-10 establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy
that prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows: 

Level
 1: Observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; 

Level
 2: Inputs, other than the quoted prices in active markets, that are observable either directly or indirectly; and 

Level
 3: Unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data, which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions. 

Recent
accounting pronouncements 

The
Company has reviewed all recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting pronouncements and do not believe the future adoption of
any such pronouncements may be expected to cause a material impact on its financial condition or the results of its operations. 

In
February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), to increase transparency and comparability among organizations
by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. Most
prominent among the amendments is the recognition of assets and liabilities by lessees for those leases classified as operating leases
under current U.S. GAAP. ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within
those fiscal years. As required by the standard, the Company will adopt the provisions of the new standard effective November 1, 2019,
using the required modified retrospective approach. We believe the adoption will not have a material impact on our financial statements.

Control and Procedures 

Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over
financial reporting is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act as a process designed by, or under the
supervision of, the company s principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by the company s board of
directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation
of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
and includes those policies and procedures that: 

Pertain
 to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets
 of the company; 

Provide
 reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with
 accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being
 made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and 

Provide
 reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company s
 assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation
of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. All internal control systems, no matter how well designed,
have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect
to financial statement preparation and presentation. Because of the inherent limitations of internal control, there is a risk that material
misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting. However, these inherent
limitations are known features of the financial reporting process. Therefore, it is possible to design into the process safeguards to
reduce, though not eliminate, this risk. 

As
of July 31, 2021, the management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria for
effective internal control over financial reporting established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee
of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO and SEC guidance on conducting such assessments. Based on
such evaluation, the management concluded that during the year covered by this Report, internal controls and procedures overall were
not effective. This was due to the deficiencies existed in the design or operation of our internal controls over financial reporting
that adversely affected our internal controls and that may be considered to be material weaknesses. 

Identified
Material Weakness 

A
material weakness in internal control over financial reporting is a control deficiency, or combination of control deficiencies, that
results in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the financial statements will not be prevented or detected. 

Management
identified the following material weakness during its assessment of internal controls over financial reporting as of July 31, 2021. 

We
do not have adequate segregation of duties and effective risk assessment Lack of segregation of duties and effective risk
assessment may cause the Company to face the likelihood of fraud or theft, due to poor oversight, governance and review to detect errors. 

Accordingly,
the Company concluded that these control deficiencies resulted in a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual
or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by the company s internal controls. 

As
a result of the material weaknesses described above, the management has concluded that the Company did not maintain effective internal
control over financial reporting as of July 31, 2021 based on the criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework
issued by COSO. 

Management s
Remediation Initiatives 

In
an effort to remediate the identified material weaknesses and other deficiencies and enhance our internal controls, we have initiated,
or plan to initiate, the following series of measures: 

1. 
 We
 plan to create a position to segregate duties consistent with control objectives and will increase our personnel resources and technical
 accounting expertise within the accounting function. The accounting personnel is responsible for reviewing the financing activities,
 facilitating the approval of the financing, recording the information regarding the financing, and submitting SEC filing related
 documents to our legal counsel in order to comply with the filing requirements of SEC. 

2. 
 We
 intend to add staff members to our management team to make sure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed and
 submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported as and when required and will the staff members
 will have segregated responsibilities with regard to these responsibilities. 

We
anticipate that these initiatives will be at least partially, if not fully, implemented by the end of fiscal year 2021. 

Changes
in internal controls over financial reporting 

There
was no change in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the year covered by this Report, which has materially
affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting: 

This
annual report does not include an attestation report of the Company s registered independent public accounting firm regarding internal
control over financial reporting. Management s report was not subject to attestation by the Company s registered independent
public accounting firm pursuant to rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission that permit the Company to provide only management s
report in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Corporate
Governance 

The
Company promotes accountability for adherence to honest and ethical conduct; endeavors to provide full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable
disclosure in reports and documents that the Company files with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC and in
other public communications made by the Company; and strives to be compliant with applicable governmental laws, rules and regulations.
The Company has not formally adopted a written code of business conduct and ethics that governs the Company s employees, officers
and Directors as the Company is not required to do so. 

In
lieu of an Audit Committee, the Company s Board of Directors is responsible for reviewing and making recommendations concerning
the selection of external auditors, reviewing the scope, results and effectiveness of the annual audit of the Company s financial
statements and other services provided by the Company s independent public accountants. The Board of Directors, Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer of the Company review the Company s internal accounting controls, practices and policies. 

Committees
of the Board 

Our
Company currently does not have nominating, compensation, or audit committees or committees performing similar functions nor does our
Company have a written nominating, compensation or audit committee charter. Our Directors believes that it is not necessary to have such
committees, at this time, because the Director(s) can adequately perform the functions of such committees. 

Audit
Committee Financial Expert 

Our
Board of Directors has determined that we do not have a board member that qualifies as an audit committee financial expert 
as defined in Item 407(D)(5) of Regulation S-K, nor do we have a Board member that qualifies as independent as the term
is used in Item 7(d)(3)(iv)(B) of Schedule 14A under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and as defined by Rule 4200(a)(14)
of the FINRA Rules. 

We
believe that our Director(s) are capable of analyzing and evaluating our financial statements and understanding internal controls and
procedures for financial reporting. The Director(s) of our Company does not believe that it is necessary to have an audit committee because
management believes that the Board of Directors can adequately perform the functions of an audit committee. In addition, we believe that
retaining an independent Director who would qualify as an audit committee financial expert would be overly costly and burdensome
and is not warranted in our circumstances given the stage of our development and the fact that we have not generated any positive cash
flows from operations to date. 

Involvement
in Certain Legal Proceedings 

Our
Directors and our Executive officers have not been involved in any of the following events during the past ten years: 

1. 
 bankruptcy
 petition filed by or against any business of which such person was a general partner or executive officer either at the time of the
 bankruptcy or within two years prior to that time; 
 
 2. 
 any
 conviction in a criminal proceeding or being subject to a pending criminal proceeding (excluding traffic violations and other minor
 offenses); 
 
 3. 
 being
 subject to any order, judgment, or decree, not subsequently reversed, suspended or vacated, of any court of competent jurisdiction,
 permanently or temporarily enjoining, barring, suspending or otherwise limiting his/her involvement in any type of business, securities
 or banking activities; or 
 
 4. 
 being
 found by a court of competent jurisdiction (in a civil action), the Commission or the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to have
 violated a federal or state securities or commodities law, and the judgment has not been reversed, suspended, or vacated. 
 
 5. 
 Such
 person was found by a court of competent jurisdiction in a civil action or by the Commission to have violated any Federal or State
 securities law, and the judgment in such civil action or finding by the Commission has not been subsequently reversed, suspended,
 or vacated; 
 
 6. 
 Such
 person was found by a court of competent jurisdiction in a civil action or by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to have violated
 any Federal commodities law, and the judgment in such civil action or finding by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission has not
 been subsequently reversed, suspended or vacated; 
 
 7. 
 Such
 person was the subject of, or a party to, any Federal or State judicial or administrative order, judgment, decree, or finding, not
 subsequently reversed, suspended or vacated, relating to an alleged violation of:(i) Any Federal or State securities or commodities
 law or regulation; or(ii) Any law or regulation respecting financial institutions or insurance companies including, but not limited
 to, a temporary or permanent injunction, order of disgorgement or restitution, civil money penalty or temporary or permanent cease-and-desist
 order, or removal or prohibition order; or(iii) Any law or regulation prohibiting mail or wire fraud or fraud in connection with
 any business entity; or 
 
 8. 
 Such
 person was the subject of, or a party to, any sanction or order, not subsequently reversed, suspended or vacated, of any self-regulatory
 organization (as defined in Section 3(a)(26) of the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(26))), any registered entity (as defined in Section
 1(a)(29) of the Commodity Exchange Act (7 U.S.C. 1(a)(29))), or any equivalent exchange, association, entity or organization that
 has disciplinary authority over its members or persons associated with a member. 

Independence
of Directors 

We
are not required to have independent members of our Board of Directors, and do not anticipate having independent Directors until such
time as we are required to do so. 

Code
of Ethics 

We
have not adopted a formal Code of Ethics. The Board of Directors has evaluated the business of the Company and the number of employees
and determined that since the business is operated by a small number of persons, general rules of fiduciary duty and federal and state
criminal, business conduct and securities laws are adequate ethical guidelines. In the event our operations, employees and/or Directors
expand in the future, we may take actions to adopt a formal Code of Ethics. 

Shareholder
Proposals 

Our
Company does not have any defined policy or procedural requirements for shareholders to submit recommendations or nominations for Directors.
The Board of Directors believes that, given the stage of our development, a specific nominating policy would be premature and of little
assistance until our business operations develop to a more advanced level. Our Company does not currently have any specific or minimum
criteria for the election of nominees to the Board of Directors and we do not have any specific process or procedure for evaluating such
nominees. The Board of Directors will assess all candidates, whether submitted by management or shareholders, and make recommendations
for election or appointment. 

A
shareholder who wishes to communicate with our Board of Directors may do so by directing a written request addressed to our President,
at the address appearing on the first page of this Information Statement.

Beneficial
ownership has been determined in accordance with Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act. Under this rule, certain shares may be deemed to
be beneficially owned by more than one person (if, for example, persons share the power to vote or the power to dispose of the shares).
In addition, shares are deemed to be beneficially owned by a person if the person has the right to acquire shares (for example, upon
exercise of a n option or warrant) within 60 days of the date as of which the information is provided.
In computing the percentage ownership of any person, the amount of shares is deemed to include the amount of shares beneficially owned

following table does not necessarily reflect the person s actual voting power at any particular date.

 power with respect to securities. Beneficial ownership also includes shares of stock subject to options and warrants currently exercisable

 of the date of this Report, (a) the numerator is the number of shares of the class beneficially owned by such person or entity, including
 shares which may be acquired within 60 days on exercise of warrants or options and conversion of convertible securities, and (b)
 the denominator is the sum of (i) the total shares of common stock outstanding on as of the date of this Annual Report (59,434,838
 shares), and (ii) the total number of shares that the beneficial owner may acquire upon exercise of the derivative securities. Unless
 otherwise stated, each beneficial owner has sole power to vote and dispose of its shares.

REPORT
OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

To
the Shareholders and Board of Directors of MU Global Holding Limited.

No. 83, Minshan St., 

 Neihu
Dist., Taipei City,

Opinion
on the Financial Statements 

We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of MU Global Holding Limited (the Company as of July 31, 2021
and 2020, and the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income, stockholders equity, and cash flows
for the each of two years in the year ended of July 31, 2021 and 2020, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial
statements ). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the
Company as of July 31, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of two years in the year ended July
31, 2021 and 2020, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 

Basis
for Opinion 

These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s
financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal
securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company
is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits
we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion
on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our
audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error
or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that
our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

Going
Concern 

The
financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 2 to the financial
statements, the Company s losses from operations and accumulated deficit raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue
as a going concern. Management s plans regarding those matters also are described in Note 2. The financial statements do not include
any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

Critical
Audit Matters 

The
critical audit matters below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or
required to be communicated to those charged with governance and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the
financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgements. The communication of critical audit
matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical
audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. 

Impairment
of property, plant and equipment 

The
Group has property, plant and equipment amounting to USD219,669 as representing 51 of the Group s total assets as at July 31,
2021. 

The
Group carries out an impairment test by comparing the recoverable amount of cash generating unit CGU based on value in
use method and the carrying amounts. 

The
impairment test was significant to our audit due to complexity of the assessment process involving significant judgements and estimation
uncertainty in making key assumptions about future market and economic conditions growth rates, profit margins, discount rate, etc. for
value in use of CGU based on the future discounted cash flows. 

Our
procedures in relation to management s impairment assessments included, amongst others: 

(a) Examining
 management s cash flows forecast that support the impairment assessment; 

(b) Assessing
 the reliability of management s forecast through the review of past trends of actual financial
 performance against previous forecast results; 

(c) Evaluating
 the reasonableness and consistency of key assumptions and inputs used in cash flow projection
 to available external industry sources of data; 

(d) Performing
 sensitivity analysis to stress test the key assumptions and inputs used in the impairment
 assessment; and 

(e) Assessing
 the adequacy and reasonableness of the disclosures in the financial statements.

Business
Overview 

MU
Global is a beauty and wellness company, providing SPA and wellness service and also SPA related products to the customers. The services
provided are designed to improve the overall health system and body function. 

Since
the establishment, the Company has been focusing to expand in the Chinese market, with other country also under consideration as target
destinations. As an emerging industry in China, the beauty and wellness industry are still in the early stage as there is a huge
potential for the industry to growth significantly. According to a report published by the Chinese State Department, the beauty and wellness
industry of the country is expected reach the market value of China 8 trillion Chinese Yuan by 2020, accounting for 6.5 of the country
Gross Domestic Product (GDP). 

In
year 2020, COVID-19 crisis has resulted the sales of the global beauty and wellness industry weak due to consumers have had limited
access to retail outlets. and supply chain bottlenecks have reduced product availability. In China, the industry s February sales
fell up to 80 percent compared with 2019. Nevertheless, based on Mckinsey and Company research report on April 8, 2021,shows that consumers
care deeply about wellness and that their interest is growing and estimate the global wellness market at more than US 1.5 trillion,
with annual growth of 5 to 10 percent. A rise in both consumer interest and purchasing power presents tremendous opportunities for companies,
particularly as spending on personal wellness rebounds after stagnating or even declining during the COVID-19 crisis 

China
has large territory, population, diverse ethnicity and cultural background. As such, it has resulted in different consumer orientations
in different cities and townships across the country, which is particularly challenging to tackle the consumer market with a single business
model. 

The
advance in technological development and rise in use of technology in marketing has also intensified the competition, probing the Company
to develop the business models that allow quick penetration and huge coverage of different markets, and also being able to cope with
the swift changes in the consumer market. Thus, the Company is focusing on three key areas as part of the Company s early development
in the Chinese market. 

The
first and most key focus is to enter the regional market through the adoption of franchisee and agent model, which the other parties
are familiar and have deep understanding in the local market, hence its operating strategy is effective and best suited the targeted
region. 

Second,
the key strategy is to ensure rapid development of the Omni channel marketing plan which targets to lease out at least ten thousand Stone
Spa Bed (Hot Stone Bath equipment), reducing the time cost for the development of project, and most importantly, working on to spur sales
and revenue growth. 

Lastly,
the essential requirement for business success in the Chinese market is to ensure and maintain a clear and transparent business model,
which would result in effective collaboration between the company and its agent/franchisee, and consequently leads to efficient market
operation and a win-win situation between the two parties 

Currently,
the Company operates in the Chinese market with two business models: 

1. 
 Tripartite
 co-operation and profit sharing model. 

2. 
 Large-scale
 chain agent model 

3.
 
 Direct-
 service store model 

2.
SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 

The
accompanying consolidated financial statements reflect the application of certain significant accounting policies as described in this
note and elsewhere in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes. 

Basis
of presentation 

These
accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the
United States of America US GAAP ). 

The
Company has adopted its fiscal year-end to be July 31. 

Basis
of consolidation 

The
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries. All inter-company accounts and transactions
have been eliminated upon consolidation. 

F- 8 

Use
of estimates 

Management
uses estimates and assumptions in preparing these financial statements in accordance with US GAAP. Those estimates and assumptions affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in the balance sheets, and the reported
revenue and expenses during the periods reported. Actual results may differ from these estimates. 

Revenue
recognition 

Financial
Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued ASC 606. The standard is a comprehensive new revenue recognition model that requires revenue
to be recognized in a manner to depict the transfer of goods or services to a customer at an amount that reflects the consideration expected
to be received in exchange for those goods or services. 

Revenue
is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, net of discounts and taxes applicable to the revenue. The
Company derives its revenue from provision of wellness and beauty services to customers via Company owned outlets, franchised outlets
or distribution of our product to third party wellness and beauty salon. 

Cost
of revenue 

Cost
of revenue includes the cost of services and product incurred to provide wellness and beauty services and purchase of products. 

Cash
and cash equivalents 

Cash
and cash equivalents are carried at cost and represent cash on hand, demand deposits placed with banks or other financial institutions
and all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less as of the purchase date of such investments. 

Property,
plant and equipment 

Property,
plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, if any. Depreciation is calculated
on the straight-line basis over the following expected useful lives from the date on which they become fully operational: 

Classification 
 
 Estimated
 useful life 
 
 Leasehold
 improvement 
 
 11
 months to 60 months (over remaining lease term) 
 
 Leasable
 equipment 
 
 5
 years 
 
 Computer
 hardware and software 
 
 3
 years 
 
 Office
 equipment 
 
 3
 years 

Expenditures
for maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. The gain or loss on the disposal of property, plant and equipment is the difference
between the net sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the relevant assets and is recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations
and Comprehensive Loss. 

Impairment
of long-live assets 

Long-lived
assets primarily include trademark of the Company. In accordance with the provision of ASC Topic 360, Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived
Assets , the Company generally conducts its annual impairment evaluation to its long-lived assets, usually in the fourth quarter of
each fiscal year, or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist, such as significant sustained change in the business climate.
The recoverability of long-lived assets is measured at the lowest level group. If the total of the expected undiscounted future net cash
flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset, a loss is recognized for the difference between the fair value and carrying amount
of the asset. There has been no impairment charge for the years presented. 

F- 9 

Leases 

Prior
to November 1, 2019, the Company accounted for leases under ASC 840, Accounting for Leases . Effective November 1, 2019, the Company
adopted the guidance of ASC 842, Leases , which requires an entity to recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for
virtually all leases. The implementation of ASC 842 did not have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements
and did not have a significant impact on our liquidity. The Company adopted ASC 842 using a modified retrospective approach. As a result,
the comparative financial information has not been updated and the required disclosures prior to the date of adoption have not been updated
and continue to be reported under the accounting standards in effect for those periods (see Note 5). 

Inventories 

Inventories
consisting of products available for sell, are stated at the lower of cost or market value. Cost of inventory is determined using the
first-in, first-out (FIFO) method. Inventory reserve is recorded to write down the cost of inventory to the estimated market value due
to slow-moving merchandise and damaged goods, which is dependent upon factors such as historical and forecasted consumer demand, and
promotional environment. The Company takes ownership, risks and rewards of the products purchased. Write downs are recorded in cost of
revenues in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss. 

Income
taxes 

Income
taxes are determined in accordance with the provisions of ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes ASC 740 ). Under this
method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial
statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
measured using enacted income tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the periods in which those temporary differences are expected
to be recovered or settled. Any effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the
period that includes the enactment date. 

ASC
740 prescribes a comprehensive model for how companies should recognize, measure, present, and disclose in their financial statements
uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return. Under ASC 740, tax positions must initially be recognized in the
financial statements when it is more likely than not the position will be sustained upon examination by the tax authorities. Such tax
positions must initially and subsequently be measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of
being realized upon ultimate settlement with the tax authority assuming full knowledge of the position and relevant facts. 

The
Company conducts major businesses in China and is subject to tax in this jurisdiction. As a result of its business activities, the Company
will file tax returns that are subject to examination by the foreign tax authority. 

Going
concern 

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared using the going concern basis of accounting, which contemplates the realization
of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. 

For
the year ended July 31, 2021, the Company has generated revenue of 64,951 and continuously incurred a net loss of 386,944. As
of July 31, 2021, the Company suffered an accumulated deficit of 2,031,848. The Company s ability to continue as a going
concern is dependent upon improving the profitability and the continuing financial support from its stockholders. Management believes
the existing shareholders or external financing will provide the additional cash to meet the Company s obligations as they become
due. 

These
and other factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. These financial statements
do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts
and classification of liabilities that may result in the Company not being able to continue as a going concern.

shares that would have been outstanding if the potential common stock equivalents had been issued and if the additional common shares
were dilutive.

Fair
value of financial instruments: 

The
carrying value of the Company s financial instruments: cash and cash equivalents, subscription receivables, prepayment and deposits,
accounts payable, and other payables and accrued liabilities approximate at their fair values because of the short-term nature of these
financial instruments. 

The
Company also follows the guidance of the ASC Topic 820-10, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures ASC 820-10 ),
with respect to financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value. ASC 820-10 establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy
that prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows: 

Level
 1: Observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; 

Level
 2: Inputs, other than the quoted prices in active markets, that are observable either directly or indirectly; and 

Level
 3: Unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data, which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions. 

Recent

have experienced foreign currency gains and losses due to the strengthening and weakening of the U.S. dollar. The potential of volatile
foreign exchange rate fluctuations in the future could have a significant effect on our results of operations. The Company has not historically
used financial instruments to hedge its foreign currency exchange rate risks. 

The
currencies that create a majority of the Company s exchange rate exposure are RMB, HK , and TWD. The Company translates all assets
and liabilities at the rate of exchange in effect at the balance sheet date and income and expense activity at the approximate rate of
exchange at the transaction date.

 SIGNIFICANT EVENTS 

On
23 January 2020, the Chinese government imposed a lockdown in Wuhan and other cities in the province of Hubei in an effort to quarantine
the center of an outbreak of COVID-19. The lockdown in the city of Wuhan has set a precedent to other cities, where other cities within
the country has implemented respective restrictive measures, including outdoor restrictions and closed management of communities. Shanghai,
where the Company primarily operates the business in, was put under closed managed communities on 10 February 2020. The Chinese economy
did fully restart until April 2021. 

The
Management had considered the impact of COVID-19 outbreak in China, which would have affected the financial position, performance and
cash flow of the Company for the financial year ended July 31, 2021. It was concluded that the impact of non-adjusting events arising
from COVID-19 outbreak has not significantly affected the fair value of the financial assets or liabilities and non-financial assets
of the Company, including the classification of non-current and current items that were presented on the reporting date. 

20.
 SUBSEQUENT EVENTS 

In
accordance with ASC Topic 855, Subsequent Events , which establishes general standards of accounting for and disclosure
of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued, the Company has evaluated all subsequent
events through the filing date of this Form 10-K with the SEC, to ensure that this filing includes appropriate disclosure of events both
recognized in the financial statements as of July 31, 2021, and events which occurred subsequently but were not recognized in the financial
statements. During the year, there was no subsequent event that required recognition or disclosure.
