All statements other than statements of historical fact included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements provide our current expectations and projections relating to our financial condition, results of operations, plans, objectives, future performance, and business. All forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those that we expected.

The Company John Deere Capital Corporation (Capital Corporation) and its subsidiaries are collectively called the Company. John Deere Financial Services, Inc. (JDFS), a wholly-owned finance holding subsidiary of Deere Company, owns all of the outstanding common stock of Capital Corporation. See Relationships of the Company with John Deere for additional information regarding agreements between the Company and Deere Company. The Company conducts business in Australia, New Zealand, the United States (U.S.), and in several countries in Africa, Asia, Europe, and Latin America, including Argentina and Mexico. Capital Corporation was incorporated under the laws of Delaware and commenced operations in 1958. The Company provides and administers financing for retail purchases of new equipment manufactured by Deere Company s production and precision agriculture operations, small agriculture and turf operations, and construction and forestry operations and used equipment taken in trade for this equipment. References to agriculture and turf include both production and precision agriculture and small agriculture and turf. The Company generally purchases retail installment sales and loan contracts (retail notes) from Deere Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries (collectively called John Deere). John Deere generally acquires these retail notes through John Deere retail dealers. The Company also purchases and finances a limited amount of non-John Deere retail notes. The Company also finances and services revolving charge accounts, in most cases acquired from and offered through merchants in the agriculture and turf and construction and forestry markets (revolving charge accounts). Additionally, the Company provides wholesale financing to dealers of John Deere agriculture and turf equipment and construction and forestry equipment (wholesale receivables), primarily to finance inventories of equipment for those dealers. In addition, the Company leases John Deere equipment and a limited amount of non-John Deere equipment to retail customers (financing and operating leases). The Company also offers credit enhanced international export financing to select customers and dealers, which primarily involves John Deere products. Retail notes, revolving charge accounts, and financing leases are collectively called Customer Receivables. Customer Receivables and wholesale receivables are collectively called Receivables. Receivables and equipment on operating leases are collectively called Receivables and Leases. John Deere s internet address is http://www.deere.com. The information contained on John Deere s website is not included in, nor incorporated by reference into, this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Business of John Deere In fiscal year 2021, John Deere implemented a new operating model and reporting structure. With this change, John Deere s agriculture and turf operations were divided into two new segments: production and precision agriculture and small agriculture and turf. There were no reporting changes for the construction and forestry and financial services segments. As a result, John Deere s operations are now categorized into four major business segments: The production and precision agriculture segment defines, develops, and delivers global equipment and technology solutions to unlock customer value for production-scale growers of large grains, small grains, cotton, and sugar.

Table of Contents 
 The segment s main products include large and certain mid-size tractors, combines, cotton pickers, sugarcane harvesters and loaders, and soil preparation, seeding, application, and crop care equipment. The small agriculture and turf segment defines, develops, and delivers global equipment and technology solutions to unlock customer value for dairy and livestock producers, high-value crop producers, and turf and utility customers. The segment s primary products include certain mid-size and small tractors, as well as hay and forage equipment, riding and commercial lawn equipment, golf course equipment, and utility vehicles. The construction and forestry segment defines, develops, and delivers a broad range of machines and technology solutions organized along the earthmoving, forestry, and roadbuilding production systems. The segment s primary products include crawler dozers and loaders, four-wheel-drive loaders, excavators, skid-steer loaders, milling machines, and log harvesters. The products and services produced by the segments above are marketed primarily through independent retail dealer networks and major retail outlets, and, as it relates to roadbuilding products in certain markets outside the U.S. and Canada, primarily through John Deere-owned sales and service subsidiaries. The financial services segment includes the operations of the Company (described herein), and additional operations in the U.S., Canada, Brazil, China, India, Russia, and Thailand. The segment primarily finances sales and leases by John Deere dealers of new and used production and precision agriculture, small agriculture and turf, and construction and forestry equipment. In addition, the financial services segment provides wholesale financing to dealers of the foregoing equipment, finances retail revolving charge accounts, and offers extended equipment warranties. John Deere s worldwide production and precision agriculture operations, small agriculture and turf operations, and construction and forestry operations are sometimes collectively referred to as the equipment operations. The financial services segment is sometimes referred to as the financial services operations. While the implementation of John Deere s new operating model in fiscal year 2021 resulted in new operating segments for John Deere, Receivables and Leases managed by the Company continue to be evaluated by market (agriculture and turf or construction and forestry). For fiscal 2021, worldwide net income attributable to Deere Company was 5.963 billion, or 18.99 per share, compared with 2.751 billion, or 8.69 per share, in fiscal 2020. Deere and Company s consolidated net sales and revenues increased 24 percent to 44.024 billion in 2021, compared with 35.540 billion in 2020. Net sales of the equipment operations increased in fiscal 2021 to 39.737 billion, compared with 31.272 billion last year. Production and precision agriculture, small agriculture and turf, and construction and forestry sales increased during 2021 due to higher shipment volumes and price realization. The financial services operations reported net income of 881 million for fiscal 2021 compared with 566 million in fiscal 2020. The increase was mainly due to improvements on operating lease residual values, a lower provision for credit losses, more favorable financing spreads, and income earned on a higher average portfolio. Market Conditions Agriculture and Turf. Industry sales of large agricultural machinery in the U.S. and Canada are forecasted to increase approximately 15 percent compared to 2021. Industry sales of small agricultural and turf equipment in the U.S. and Canada are expected to be flat in 2022. Industry sales of agricultural machinery in Europe are forecasted to be about 5 percent higher, while South American industry sales of tractors and combines are forecasted to be roughly 5 percent higher in 2022. Asia industry sales are forecasted to be nearly the same in 2022 as in 2021. Construction and Forestry. On an industry basis, North American construction equipment and compact construction equipment sales are both expected to be 5 to 10 percent higher in 2022. Global forestry industry sales are projected to increase 10 to 15 percent.

 Financial Services, including the Company. Results for the full-year fiscal 2022 are expected to be slightly lower due to a higher provision for credit losses, lower gains on operating lease residual values, and higher selling, general, and administrative expenses. These factors are expected to be partially offset by income earned on a higher average portfolio. Relationships of the Company with John Deere The results of operations of the Company are affected by its relationships with John Deere, including, among other items, the terms on which the Company acquires Receivables and Leases and borrows funds from John Deere, the reimbursement for interest waiver and low-rate finance programs from John Deere, the compensation paid by John Deere in connection with the Company s purchase of trade receivables from John Deere, and the payment to John Deere for various expenses applicable to the Company s operations. In addition, John Deere and the Company have joint access to certain lines of credit. The Company s acquisition volume of Receivables and Leases is largely dependent upon the level of retail sales and leases of John Deere products. The level of John Deere retail sales and leases is responsive to a variety of economic, financial, climatic, legislative, and other factors that influence demand for its products. The majority of the Company s businesses are affected by changes in interest rates, demand for credit, and competition. The Company bears substantially all of the credit risk (net of recovery from withholdings from certain John Deere dealers and merchants) associated with its holding of Receivables and Leases. A small portion of the Receivables and Leases held (less than 5 percent) is guaranteed by certain subsidiaries of Deere Company. The Company also performs substantially all servicing and collection functions. Servicing and collection functions for a small portion of the Receivables and Leases held (less than 5 percent) are provided by John Deere. John Deere is reimbursed for staff and other administrative services at estimated cost and for credit lines provided to the Company based on utilization of those lines. The terms and the basis on which the Company acquires retail notes and certain wholesale receivables from John Deere are governed by agreements with John Deere, generally terminable by either John Deere or the Company on 30 days notice. As provided in these agreements, the Company agrees to the terms and conditions for purchasing the retail notes and wholesale receivables from John Deere. Under these agreements, John Deere is not obligated to sell notes to the Company, and the Company is obligated to purchase notes from John Deere only if the notes comply with the terms and conditions set by the Company. The basis on which John Deere acquires retail notes and wholesale receivables from John Deere dealers is governed by agreements with those dealers, which may be terminated in accordance with their terms and applicable law. In acquiring these notes from dealers, the terms and conditions, as set forth in agreements with the dealers, conform with the terms and conditions adopted by the Company in determining the acceptability of retail and certain wholesale notes to be purchased from John Deere. The dealers are not obligated to sell these notes to John Deere and John Deere is not obligated to accept these notes from the dealers. In practice, retail and wholesale notes are acquired from dealers only if the terms of these notes and the creditworthiness of the customers are acceptable to the Company. The Company acts on behalf of both itself and John Deere in determining the acceptability of the notes and in acquiring acceptable notes from dealers. The basis on which the Company enters into leases with retail customers through John Deere dealers is governed by agreements between dealers and the Company. Leases are accepted based on the terms and conditions, the lessees creditworthiness, the anticipated residual values of the equipment, and the intended use of the equipment. Deere Company has an agreement with Capital Corporation pursuant to which it has agreed to continue to own, directly or through one or more wholly-owned subsidiaries, at least 51 percent of the voting shares of capital stock of Capital Corporation and to maintain the Company s consolidated tangible net worth at not less than 50.0 million. This agreement also obligates Deere Company to make payments to Capital Corporation such that its consolidated ratio of earnings to fixed charges is not less than 1.05 to 1 for each fiscal quarter. Deere Company s obligations to make payments to Capital Corporation under the agreement are independent of whether the Company is in default on its indebtedness, obligations, or other liabilities. Further, Deere Company s obligations under the agreement are not measured by the amount of the Company s indebtedness, obligations, or other liabilities. Deere Company s obligations to make payments under this agreement are expressly stated not to be a guaranty of any specific indebtedness, obligation, or liability of the Company and are enforceable only by or in the name of Capital Corporation. No payments were required

 under this agreement during the periods included in the consolidated financial statements. At October 31, 2021, Deere Company indirectly owned 100 percent of the voting shares of Capital Corporation s capital stock and Capital Corporation s consolidated tangible net worth was 4,524.4 million. The Company purchases certain wholesale trade receivables from John Deere. These trade receivables arise from John Deere s sales of goods to independent dealers. Under the terms of the sales to dealers, interest is primarily charged to dealers on outstanding balances, from the earlier of the date when goods are sold to retail customers by the dealer or the expiration of certain interest-free periods granted at the time of the sale to the dealer, until payment is received by the Company. Dealers cannot cancel purchases after John Deere recognizes a sale and are responsible for payment even if the equipment is not sold to retail customers. The interest-free periods are determined based on the type of equipment sold and the time of year of the sale. These periods range from one to twelve months for most equipment. Interest-free periods may not be extended. Interest charged may not be forgiven and the past due interest rates exceed market rates. The Company receives compensation from John Deere at approximate market interest rates for these interest-free periods. The Company computes the compensation from John Deere for interest-free periods based on the Company s estimated funding costs, administrative and operating expenses, credit losses, and required return on equity. Description of Receivables and Leases Receivables and Leases arise mainly from retail and wholesale sales and leases of John Deere products and used equipment accepted in trade for them, and from retail sales of equipment of unrelated manufacturers. Receivables and Leases also include revolving charge accounts receivable. At October 31, 2021 and November 1, 2020, at least 90 percent of the Receivables and Leases administered by the Company were for financing that facilitated the purchase or lease of John Deere products. John Deere Financial, f.s.b. (Thrift) is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Capital Corporation. It holds a federal thrift charter and is regulated by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC). The U.S. Federal Reserve Board has oversight of the Company, as the owner of the Thrift. The Thrift is headquartered in Madison, Wisconsin and offers revolving charge products including John Deere Financial Multi-Use Account, PowerPlan , and John Deere Financial Revolving Plan throughout the U.S. The John Deere Financial Multi-Use Account is used by farmers and ranchers to finance their purchases of production inputs from agribusiness merchants, including seed, fertilizer, and crop protection. The John Deere Financial Multi-Use Account is also used by agriculture and turf customers to finance the purchase of parts and service from John Deere dealers. PowerPlan is primarily used by construction and forestry customers to finance the purchase of equipment parts, equipment rentals, and service work performed at John Deere construction and forestry dealers. The John Deere Financial Revolving Plan is used primarily by retail customers of John Deere dealers to finance purchases of turf and utility equipment. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements under Revolving Charge Accounts Receivable. The Company provides wholesale financing to John Deere dealers, primarily to finance agriculture and turf and construction and forestry equipment inventories. A large portion of the wholesale financing is provided by the Company to dealers from whom it also purchases agriculture and turf and construction and forestry retail notes. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements under Wholesale Receivables. The Company generally requires that theft and physical damage insurance be carried on all goods leased or securing retail notes and wholesale receivables. In certain markets, the customer may, at the customer s own expense, have the Company or the seller of the goods purchase this insurance or obtain it from other sources. Insurance is not required for goods purchased under revolving charge accounts. Receivables and Leases are eligible for acceptance if they conform to prescribed finance and lease plan terms. Guidelines relating to down payments and contract terms on retail notes and leases are described in Note 4 and Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In limited circumstances, Receivables and Leases may be accepted and acquired even though they do not conform in all respects to the established guidelines. The Company determines whether Receivables and Leases should be accepted and how they should be serviced. Acceptance of these Receivables and Leases is dependent on having one or more risk mitigation enhancements that may include the pledge of additional collateral as security, the assignment of specific earnings to the Company, or the acceptance of accelerated payment schedules. Officers of the Company are responsible

Table of Contents 
 for establishing policies and reviewing the performance of the Company in accepting and collecting Receivables and Leases. The Company performs substantially all of its own routine collections, settlements, and repossessions on Receivables and Leases. John Deere retail notes and wholesale receivables are generally supported by perfected security interests in goods financed under laws such as the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), certain federal statutes, and state motor vehicle laws in the U.S. and by security in goods or other security under applicable laws in other countries and jurisdictions. UCC financing statements are also prepared and filed on leases; however, these filings for operating leases are made for informational purposes only. Finance Rates on Retail Notes As of October 31, 2021 and November 1, 2020, over 95 percent of the retail notes held by the Company bore a fixed finance rate. A portion of the finance income earned by the Company arises from reimbursements from John Deere in connection with financing the retail sales of John Deere equipment on which finance charges are waived or reduced by John Deere for a period from the date of sale to a specified subsequent date. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Average Original Term and Average Actual Life of Retail Notes and Leases Due to prepayments (often from trade-ins and refinancing), the average actual life of retail notes and leases is considerably shorter than the average original term. The following table shows the average original term for retail notes and leases acquired during the year and the average actual life for retail notes and leases liquidated during the year (in months):

The delinquency status of Receivables granted relief due to COVID is based on the modified payment schedule (see Note 5). During the first quarter of 2019, the Company amended the timing in which finance income and lease revenue is generally suspended on retail notes, revolving charge accounts, and finance lease accounts from 120 days delinquent to 90 days delinquent. This change in estimate was made on a prospective basis and did not have a significant effect on the Company s consolidated financial statements. Management s methodology to determine the collectability of delinquent accounts was not affected by the change.

Allowance for Credit Losses The allowance for credit losses is an estimate of the credit losses expected over the life of the Receivable portfolio. The allowance is measured on a collective basis when similar risk characteristics exist. Risk characteristics considered by the Company include product category, market, geography, credit risk, and remaining duration. Receivables that do not share risk characteristics with other receivables in the portfolio are evaluated on an individual basis. The Company utilizes loss forecast models, which are selected based on the size and credit risk of the underlying pool of receivables, to estimate expected credit losses. Transition matrix models are used for large and complex Customer Receivable pools, while weighted average remaining maturity models are used for smaller and less complex Customer Receivable pools. Expected credit losses on wholesale receivables are based on historical loss rates, with consideration of current economic conditions and dealer financial risk. The modeled expected credit losses are adjusted based on reasonable and supportable forecasts, which may include economic indicators such as commodity prices, industry equipment sales, unemployment rates, and housing starts. Management reviews each model s output quarterly, and qualitative adjustments are incorporated as necessary. Receivables are written off to the allowance when the account is considered uncollectible. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.

 The total allowance for credit losses, by product, at October 31, 2021, November 1, 2020, November 3, 2019, October 28, 2018, and October 29, 2017 (in millions of dollars), and the portfolio, by product, as a percent of total portfolio are presented below: 2021 2020 2019 2018 2017 Dollars Percent Dollars Percent Dollars Percent Dollars Percent Dollars Percent Retail notes and financing leases: Agriculture and turf 49.2 61 23.4 56 23.9 51 24.7 52 35.6 54 Construction and forestry 47.3 13 53.5 12 29.8 11 32.6 10 28.6 10 Total retail notes and financing leases 96.5 74 76.9 67 53.7 61 56.4 62 64.2 63 Revolving charge accounts 20.8 10 42.3 11 39.3 12 42.3 12 39.7 13 Wholesale receivables 11.7 16 9.9 22 7.6 27 8.0 26 9.9 24 Total 129.0 100 129.1 100 100.6 100 106.7 100 113.8 100 As a result of the adoption of ASU No. 2016-13, the allowance for credit losses increased 19.7 million at the beginning of 2021. Subsequent to the adoption of ASU No. 2016-13, the allowance decreased 19.8 million, primarily due to a reduction in the allowance on construction and forestry retail notes and financing leases and a lower allowance on revolving charge accounts. The allowance on construction and forestry retail notes and financing leases decreased due to improving market conditions and better than expected performance of accounts granted payment relief due to the economic effects of COVID, while the allowance on revolving charge accounts was favorably impacted by strong payment performance due to continued improvements in the agriculture and turf market. These decreases were partially offset by growth in the retail notes and financing leases portfolio. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. The total allowance for credit losses, by geographic area, at October 31, 2021, November 1, 2020, November 3, 2019, October 28, 2018, and October 29, 2017 (in millions of dollars), and the portfolio, by geographic area, as a percent of total portfolio, are presented below: 2021 2020 2019 2018 2017 Dollars Percent Dollars Percent Dollars Percent Dollars Percent Dollars Percent U.S. 103.5 84 108.1 84 81.1 85 90.3 85 100.0 85 Outside the U.S. 25.5 16 21.0 16 19.5 15 16.4 15 13.8 15 Total 129.0 100 129.1 100 100.6 100 106.7 100 113.8 100 Competition The businesses in which the Company is engaged are highly competitive. The Company primarily competes for customers with commercial banks and finance and leasing companies based upon its service, finance rates charged, and other finance terms. In addition, the competitive landscape is evolving as technology is unlocking new capabilities for traditional competitors and enabling new digital entrants that could be either technology partners or potential competitors. The proportion of John Deere equipment retail sales and leases financed by the Company is influenced by conditions prevailing in the agriculture and turf equipment and construction and forestry equipment industries, in the financial markets, and in business generally. The Company financed a significant portion of John Deere equipment retail sales and leases in many of the countries in which the Company operated during 2021 and 2020. The Company emphasizes convenient service to customers and endeavors to offer terms desired in its specialized markets, such as seasonal schedules of repayment and rentals. The Company s retail finance rates and lease rates are generally believed to be in the range offered by other sales finance and leasing companies, although not as low as those of some banks and other lenders and lessors. Regulation In several U.S. states, state law limits the maximum finance rate on receivables. The present state limitations have not, thus far, significantly limited variable-rate finance charges or the fixed-rate finance charges established by the 
 10 

Table of Contents 
 Company. However, if interest rate levels should increase significantly, maximum state rates could affect the Company by preventing the variable rates on outstanding variable-rate retail notes from increasing above the maximum state rate and by limiting the fixed rates on new notes. In some states, the Company may be able to qualify new retail notes for a higher maximum rate limit by using retail installment sales contracts (rather than loan contracts) or by using fixed-rate rather than variable-rate contracts. In addition to rate regulation, various U.S. state and federal laws and regulations apply to some Receivables and Leases, principally retail notes for goods sold for personal, family, or household use and John Deere Financial Revolving Plan, John Deere Financial Multi-Use Account, and PowerPlan accounts receivable. To date, these laws and regulations have not had a significant adverse effect on the Company. The Thrift holds a federal thrift charter and is subject to regulation and examination by the OCC. The U.S. Federal Reserve Board has oversight of the Company, as the owner of the Thrift. The manner in which the Company offers financing outside the U.S. is affected by a variety of country specific laws, regulations, and customs, including those governing property rights and debtor obligations, that are subject to change and that may introduce greater risk to the Company. In fiscal year 2021, compliance with the regulations applicable to the Company did not have a material effect on capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position. The Company does not expect to incur material capital expenditures related to compliance with regulations during fiscal year 2022. Additional information about the impact of government regulations on the Company s business is included in Item 1A, Risk Factors under the headings Geopolitical Uncertainties; Data Security and Privacy Risks; Environmental, Climate and Weather Risks; and Legal and Regulatory Risks. Human Capital Higher Purpose As a wholly-owned subsidiary of Deere Company, the Company s employees, its human capital, are guided by John Deere s higher purpose: We run so life can leap forward. Employees are further guided by John Deere s code of business conduct (Code), which helps them to uphold and strengthen the standards of honor and integrity that have defined John Deere since its founding. Our world and business may change, but our core values integrity, quality, commitment and innovation are a constant in everything we do. Our values have shaped and guided John Deere s vision since 1837. Employees At October 31, 2021, the Company had 1,470 full-time and part-time employees. The Company also retains consultants, independent contractors, and temporary workers. Code of Business Conduct John Deere and the Company are committed to conducting business in accordance with the highest ethical standards. This means how we conduct ourselves and our global work is more than just a matter of policy and law; it s a reflection of our core values. The Code, refreshed in 2021, provides specific guidance to all John Deere employees, outlining how we can and must uphold and strengthen the integrity that has defined John Deere since its founding. All employees must complete Code training and, where permitted by law, must also certify each year that they will comply with the Code. The Company maintains a global compliance hotline to allow for concerns to be brought forward. Health and Safety John Deere and the Company have taken and continue to take extraordinary measures to protect their workforce in response to COVID. Safety protocols continue to be in place for employees who work onsite, including enhanced cleaning and sanitation. Where possible, the Company has supported flexible work arrangements for employees throughout the pandemic, including by deploying new technologies to strengthen virtual connectivity. The Company also provided financial support for employees who struggled to provide childcare during the pandemic. The Company continues to strive

 to be agile in addressing employee needs in the quickly evolving environment while also being transparent across the workforce. Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) In order to ensure that each of our employees can bring their full selves to work, John Deere and the Company strive to foster a diverse, equitable, and inclusive workplace where all voices are heard and included. John Deere continues to champion policies, practices, and behaviors that amplify innovation on behalf of people, community, and planet. Diversity, equity, and inclusion are critical to our success as an organization. Incorporating DEI into our business practices enhances innovation and enables our best talent to thrive in an environment where diverse perspectives are celebrated. This requires deliberate intention and action on the part of every employee and leader. We will continue to push forward on the path to a more diverse, equitable, and inclusive culture with our colleagues, customers, and dealers. In doing so, experience tells us we will be more engaged, innovative, and successful. The Company s leadership sets a consistent and transparent tone on diversity and inclusion. Leadership training focuses on building an inclusive environment and driving positive behavioral change. To help managers with development and team building, we measure inclusiveness as part of our employee experience survey. We are working to further weave DEI into all aspects of how we lead and do business. In addition to regional councils, we have formed a global diversity and inclusion council with senior leaders who own our DEI journey. This journey is a collective effort that involves every level of our organization. As part of the annual sustainability report available on John Deere s website, John Deere has publicly disclosed the number of women and minorities in leadership positions throughout the organization, which includes the Company, and continues to launch initiatives to increase representation of minorities in the workforce. John Deere and the Company proudly partner with several professional organizations to support our diversity recruitment strategy, including the National Black MBA Association, Inc., the Society of Women Engineers, the Thurgood Marshall College Fund Leadership Institute, the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers, and Minorities in Agriculture, Natural Resources, and Related Sciences. John Deere-sponsored employee resource groups (ERGs), in which Company employees participate, are employee-run organizations formed around a common dimension of diversity, interest, or experience that affects the workplace. ERGs bring together individuals with shared interests while serving as resources to our business. The efforts of our ERGs address three key focus areas employee development, community involvement, and business alignment. John Deere has 12 ERGs and the Company has approximately 700 employees engaged in these ERGs globally. Compensation and Benefits To attract and retain talent, the Company offers competitive compensation and non-financial benefits everywhere we operate. These benefits are tailored to the specific markets in which our employees are located. The non-compensation benefits we offer focus on all aspects of employee well-being, including physical, social, community, and career. We conduct regular surveys of the market rates for jobs to ensure our compensation is competitive. We offer a variety of working arrangements, including flexible schedules, telecommuting, and job sharing, to help employees manage home and work-life situations. Training and Development The Company provides training and development opportunities for employees at all stages of their careers to empower them to reach their full potential. Employees are critical to the long-term success of the Company s business. We encourage employees to identify the paths that can build the skills, experience, knowledge, and competencies needed for career advancement. The Company supports employees by creating purpose-driven work opportunities, comprehensive performance reviews and development plans, mentoring opportunities, and professional and personal development opportunities. The Company provided approximately 20.3 training hours per full-time equivalent administrative/professional employee globally in fiscal year 2021. The Company s training programs, which are tailored to different geographic regions and job functions, include among other topics: relationships with customers and dealers, the Company s culture and values, compliance with the Code, compliance with anti-bribery/corruption laws and policies, compliance with management of private data and cybersecurity, compliance with conflicts of interest, discrimination and workplace harassment policies, and sexual harassment policies.

The Company is a subsidiary of JDFS, a wholly-owned finance holding subsidiary of Deere Company. The results of operations of the Company are affected by its relationships with John Deere. See Relationships of the Company with John Deere on page 4 for additional information regarding the relationship between the Company and John Deere. The following risks are considered material to the Company s business based upon current knowledge, information, and assumptions. This discussion of risk factors should be considered closely in conjunction with Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations beginning on page 23, including the risks and uncertainties described in the Safe Harbor Statement on pages 30-32, the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements beginning on page 44, and the risk factors of Deere Company included in Exhibit 99 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K and incorporated herein by reference. These risk factors and other forward-looking statements that relate to future events, expectations, trends, and operating periods involve certain factors that are subject to change, and important risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Some of these risks and uncertainties could affect particular portions of the business, while others could affect all of the Company s business. Although the risks are organized by headings, and each risk is discussed separately, many are interrelated. The Company, except as required by law, undertakes no obligation to update or revise this risk factors discussion, whether as a result of new developments or otherwise. The risks described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and the Safe Harbor Statement in this report are not the only risks faced by the Company. Risks Related to the COVID Pandemic The COVID pandemic resulted in additional risks that could materially adversely affect the Company s business, financial condition, results of operations and/or cash flows. The virus causing COVID was identified in late 2019 and spread globally (COVID pandemic). Efforts to combat the virus have been complicated by viral variants and uneven access to, and acceptance and effectiveness of, vaccines globally. The pandemic resulted in governments and other authorities implementing numerous measures to try to contain the virus, such as travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter in place orders and business closures. These measures have impacted and may continue to impact all or portions of the Company s workforce and operations and the operations of customers and dealers. Although certain restrictions related to the COVID pandemic have eased, uncertainty continues to exist regarding such measures and potential future measures. Current material and component shortages have limited and could continue to limit John Deere s ability to meet customer demand, which could have a material adverse effect on John Deere s and the Company s financial condition, cash flows, and results of operations. The COVID pandemic caused a global recession and the sustainability of the economic recovery observed in 2021 remains unclear. The COVID pandemic has also significantly increased economic and demand uncertainty, has caused inflationary pressure in the U.S. and elsewhere, and has led to disruption and volatility in the global capital markets. Economic uncertainties could continue to affect demand for John Deere s products, the value of the equipment financed or leased, the demand for financing, and the financial condition and credit risk of John Deere dealers and customers. Continued uncertainties related to the magnitude, duration, and persistent effects of the COVID pandemic may significantly adversely affect John Deere s and the Company s business and outlook. These uncertainties include, among other things: the duration and impact of the resurgence in COVID cases in any country, state, or region; the emergence, contagiousness, and threat of new and different strains of virus; the availability, acceptance, and effectiveness of vaccines; 
 13 

Table of Contents 
 additional closures or other actions as mandated or otherwise made necessary by governmental authorities, including employee vaccine mandates; disruptions in the supply chain, including those caused by industry capacity constraints, material availability, and global logistics delays and constraints arising from, among other things, the transportation capacity of ocean shipping containers and a prolonged delay in resumption of operations by one or more of John Deere s key suppliers, or the failure of any key supplier; an increasingly competitive labor market due to a sustained labor shortage or increased turnover caused by the COVID pandemic; additional operating costs due to continued remote working arrangements, adherence to social distancing guidelines, and other COVID-related challenges; increased risk of cyberattacks on network connections used in remote working arrangements; increased privacy-related risks due to processing health-related personal information; legal claims related to alleged exposure to COVID on Company premises; absence of employees due to illness; and the impact of the pandemic on the Company s customers and John Deere dealers. These factors, and others that are currently unknown or considered immaterial, could materially and adversely affect the Company s business, liquidity, results of operations and financial position. Geopolitical Uncertainties International, national and regional trade laws, regulations, and policies (particularly those related to or restricting global trade), and government farm programs and policies could significantly impair John Deere s profitability and growth prospects. As the Company s acquisition volume of Receivables and Leases is largely dependent upon the level of retail sales and leases of John Deere products, these geopolitical uncertainties could also negatively impact the Company s profitability and growth prospects. International, national, and regional laws, regulations, and policies directly or indirectly related to or restricting the import and export of John Deere s products, services, and technology, or those of its customers, including protectionist policies in particular jurisdictions or for the benefit of favored industries or sectors, could harm John Deere s global business. John Deere s profitability and growth prospects are tied directly to the global marketplace. Restricted access to global markets impairs John Deere s ability to export goods and services from its various manufacturing locations around the world and limits the ability to access raw materials and high quality parts and components at competitive prices on a timely basis. Trade restrictions, including withdrawal from or modification of existing trade agreements, negotiation of new trade agreements, non-tariff trade barriers, local content requirements, and imposition of new or retaliatory tariffs against certain countries or covering certain products, including developments in U.S.-China trade relations, could limit John Deere s ability to capitalize on current and future growth opportunities in international markets and impair John Deere s ability to expand the business by offering new technologies, products, and services. These trade restrictions, and changes in or uncertainty surrounding global trade policies, may affect John Deere s competitive position. Furthermore, market access and the ability to export agricultural and forestry commodities is critical to John Deere s agricultural and forestry customers. Policies impacting exchange rates and commodity prices or those limiting the export or import of commodities could have a material adverse effect on the international flow of agricultural and other commodities that may result in a corresponding negative effect on the demand for agricultural and forestry equipment in many areas of the world. John Deere s agricultural equipment sales could be especially harmed by such policies because farm income strongly influences sales of agricultural equipment around the world. Furthermore, trade restrictions could impede those in developing countries from achieving a higher standard of living, which could negatively impact John Deere s future growth opportunities arising from increasing global demand for food, fuel, and infrastructure. Additionally, changes in government farm programs and policies, including direct payment and other subsidies, can significantly influence demand for agricultural equipment as well as create unequal competition for multinational companies relative to domestic companies. Embargoes, sanctions and export controls imposed by the U.S. and other governments restricting or prohibiting transactions with certain persons or entities, including financial institutions, to certain countries or regions, or involving certain products, limit the sales of John Deere products. Embargoes, sanctions, and export control laws are changing rapidly for certain geographies, including with respect to China, Russia, Myanmar (Burma), and Belarus. In particular, changing U.S. export controls and sanctions on China, as well as other restrictions affecting transactions involving China and Chinese parties, could affect John Deere s ability to collect receivables, provide aftermarket and warranty support for John Deere equipment, and sell products, and otherwise impact John Deere s reputation and business. Although John Deere and the Company have a compliance program in place designed to reduce the likelihood of potential violations of import and export laws and sanctions, violations of these laws or sanctions could harm John Deere s and the Company s 
 14 

Table of Contents 
 reputation and business, and may subject John Deere or the Company to civil and criminal sanctions, any of which could have a material adverse effect on John Deere s or the Company s results of operations and financial condition. Greater political, economic, and social uncertainty and the evolving globalization of businesses could significantly change the dynamics of John Deere s and the Company s competition, customer base, and product offerings and impact John Deere s and the Company s growth opportunities globally. John Deere s efforts to grow its businesses depend in part upon access to additional geographic markets, including, but not limited to, Argentina, Brazil, China, India, Russia, and South Africa, and its success in developing market share and operating profitably in such markets. In some cases, these countries have greater political and economic volatility, greater vulnerability to infrastructure and labor disruptions, and differing local customer product preferences and requirements than John Deere s other markets. Negative market conditions resulting from economic and political uncertainties in these and other countries could reduce customer confidence, resulting in declines in demand and increases in delinquencies and default rates, which could affect write-offs and provisions for credit losses. Operating and seeking to expand business in a number of different regions and countries exposes John Deere and the Company to multiple and potentially conflicting cultural practices, business practices, and legal and regulatory requirements that are subject to change and are often complex and difficult to navigate, including those related to tariffs and trade barriers, investments, property ownership rights, taxation, sanctions and export control requirements, repatriation of earnings, and advanced technologies. The agricultural equipment industry continues to undergo significant changes and is becoming even more competitive through the emergence and expanding global capability of many competitors. Expanding business operations globally also increases exposure to currency fluctuations, which can materially affect John Deere s and the Company s financial results. While John Deere maintains a positive corporate image and its brands are widely recognized and valued in its traditional markets, the brands are less well known in some emerging markets, which could impede John Deere s efforts to successfully compete in these markets. Although John Deere is taking measures to adapt to these changing circumstances, John Deere s and the Company s reputation and/or business results could be negatively affected should these efforts prove unsuccessful. Uncertain Economic Conditions Negative economic conditions and outlook can materially weaken demand for John Deere s equipment and services, limit access to funding, and result in higher funding costs for John Deere and the Company. The demand for the Company s and John Deere s products and services can be significantly reduced in an economic environment characterized by high unemployment, cautious consumer spending, lower corporate earnings, U.S. budget issues, and lower business investment. Negative or uncertain economic conditions that cause John Deere s customers to lack confidence in the general economic outlook can significantly reduce their likelihood of purchasing John Deere s equipment. As discussed under Risks Related to the COVID Pandemic The COVID pandemic resulted in additional risks that could materially adversely affect the Company s business, financial condition, results of operations, and/or cash flows , the COVID pandemic caused a global recession and significantly increased economic and demand uncertainty. Sustained negative economic conditions and outlook affect housing starts, energy demand, and other construction, which dampens demand for certain construction equipment. John Deere s turf operations and its construction and forestry business are dependent on construction activity and general economic conditions. Decreases in construction activity and housing starts could have a material adverse effect on John Deere s and the Company s results of operations. If negative economic conditions affect the overall farm economy, there could be a similar effect on John Deere s agricultural equipment sales. In addition, uncertain or negative outlook with respect to pervasive U.S. fiscal issues as well as general economic conditions and outlook can cause significant changes in market liquidity conditions. Such changes could impact access to funding and associated funding costs, which could reduce the Company s earnings and cash flows. Additionally, John Deere s and the Company s investment management activities could be adversely affected by changes in the equity and bond markets, which would negatively affect earnings. In addition, demand for John Deere s and the Company s products and services can be significantly reduced by concerns regarding the diverse economic and political circumstances of the individual countries in the eurozone, the debt burden of certain eurozone countries and their ability to meet future financial obligations, the risk that one or more other European Union countries could come under increasing pressure to leave the European Union, or the long-term stability of the euro as a single common currency. Persistent disparity with respect to the widely varying economic conditions 
 15 

Table of Contents 
 within the individual countries in the eurozone, and its implications for the euro as well as market perceptions concerning these and related issues, could adversely affect the value of John Deere s and the Company s euro-denominated assets and obligations, have an adverse effect on demand for John Deere s and the Company s products and services in the eurozone, and have an adverse effect on financial markets in Europe and globally. More specifically, it could affect the ability of John Deere s and the Company s customers, suppliers, and lenders to finance their respective businesses and access liquidity at acceptable financing costs, if at all, as well as the availability of supplies and materials and the demand for John Deere s products. Financial Risks Because the Company is subject to interest rate risks, changes in interest rates can reduce demand for equipment, adversely affect interest margins, and limit access to capital markets while increasing borrowing costs. Rising interest rates could have a dampening effect on overall economic activity and/or the financial condition of the Company s customers, either or both of which could negatively affect customer demand for John Deere equipment and customers ability to repay obligations to the Company. In addition, credit market dislocations could have an impact on funding costs, which are very important to the Company because such costs affect the Company s ability to offer customers competitive financing rates. While the Company strives to match the interest rate characteristics of its financial assets and liabilities, changing interest rates could have an adverse effect on the Company s net interest rate margin the difference between the yield the Company earns on its assets and the interest rates the Company pays for funding, which could in turn affect the Company s net interest income and earnings. Actions by credit rating agencies, such as downgrades or negative changes to ratings outlooks, can affect the availability and cost of funding for the Company and can increase the Company s cost of capital and hurt its competitive position. Changes in government banking, monetary, and fiscal policies could have a negative effect on the Company. Policies of the U.S. and other governments regarding banking, monetary, and fiscal policies intended to promote or maintain liquidity, stabilize financial markets, and/or address local deficit or structural economic issues may not be effective and could have a material impact on the Company s customers and markets. Failure of the U.S. federal government to pass a 2022 budget resolution could lead to a U.S. default under its sovereign debt, the consequences of which could have significant and unpredictable effects on global financial markets, which could in turn negatively affect John Deere s and the Company s operating results, cash flows, and financial condition. The Company s operations and results could also be affected by financial regulatory reform that could have an adverse effect on the Company and its customers by limiting their ability to enter into hedging transactions or to finance purchases of John Deere products. Government policies on spending can also affect John Deere, especially the construction and forestry segment, due to the impact of government spending on infrastructure development. The Company s and John Deere s operations, including those outside of the United States, may also be affected by non-U.S. regulatory reforms being implemented to further regulate non-U.S. financial institutions and markets. Changes in tax rates, tax legislation, or exposure to additional tax liabilities could have a negative effect on John Deere and the Company. John Deere and the Company are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. John Deere s domestic and international tax liabilities are dependent upon the location of earnings among these different jurisdictions. Tax rates in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change. John Deere s and the Company s effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, or changes in tax laws or their interpretations. If John Deere s and the Company s effective tax rates were to increase, or if the ultimate determination of its taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, John Deere s and the Company s operating results, cash flows, and financial condition could be adversely affected. The Company s consolidated financial results are reported in U.S. dollars while certain assets and other reported items are denominated in the currencies of other countries, creating currency exchange and translation risk. The Company operates in many areas of the world, involving transactions denominated in a variety of currencies. The Company is subject to currency exchange risk to the extent that its costs are denominated in currencies other than 
 16 

Table of Contents 
 those in which it earns revenues. Additionally, the reporting currency for the Company s consolidated financial statements is the U.S. dollar. Certain of the Company s assets, liabilities, expenses, and revenues are denominated in other countries currencies. Those assets, liabilities, expenses, and revenues are translated into U.S. dollars at the applicable exchange rates to prepare the Company s consolidated financial statements. Therefore, increases or decreases in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and those other currencies affect the value of those items as reflected in the Company s consolidated financial statements, even if their value remains unchanged in their original currencies. Substantial fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar could have a significant impact on the Company s results. Because the Company is a financing company, negative economic conditions in the financial industry could materially impact the Company s operations and financial results. Negative economic conditions can have an adverse effect on the financial industry in which the Company operates. The Company provides financing for a significant portion of John Deere s sales in many of the countries in which the Company operates. The Company is exposed to the risk that customers and others will default on contractual obligations and may experience credit losses that exceed its expectations and adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations. The Company s inability to access funds at cost-effective rates to support its financing activities could have a material adverse effect on the Company s business. The Company s liquidity and ongoing profitability depend largely on timely access to capital in order to meet future cash flow requirements, and to fund operations and costs associated with engaging in diversified funding activities. Additionally, negative market conditions could reduce customer confidence levels, resulting in declines in credit applications and increases in delinquencies and default rates, which could materially impact the Company s write-offs and provision for credit losses. The Company s results could be adversely affected by a decrease in the value or higher than estimated returns of equipment on operating lease. The Company estimates the end-of-lease term residual value at the inception of the operating leases based on a number of factors, including lease term, expected hours of usage, historical wholesale sale prices, return experience, intended use of the equipment, market dynamics and trends, and third-party residual guarantees. Used equipment values may decrease as a result of any one or a combination of factors including market conditions, supply of and demand for used equipment, and technological advancements in new equipment. Lower residual value estimates could result in increasing operating lease depreciation, impairment losses, and losses on the sale of matured operating lease inventory, which would decrease the Company s earnings. The transition away from the London Interbank Offered Rate LIBOR and the adoption of alternative reference rates could adversely affect the Company s business and results of operations. The Company is exposed to LIBOR-based financial instruments, primarily relating to debt, derivative, and receivables transactions, that have been entered into previously and remain outstanding. The LIBOR benchmark has been subject of national, international, and other regulatory guidance and proposals for reform. In July 2017, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit rates for calculation of LIBOR after 2021. In November 2020, the Intercontinental Exchange announced that it intends to cease publication of certain LIBOR settings by the end of 2021 while continuing to publish overnight and one-, three-, six-, and twelve-month U.S. dollar LIBOR rates through June 30, 2023. However, in early 2021, the United States Federal Reserve Board and other regulatory bodies issued guidance encouraging banks and other financial market participants to cease entering into new contracts that use U.S. dollar LIBOR as a reference rate as soon as practicable and in any event no later than December 31, 2021. These actions may cause LIBOR to perform differently than in the past and LIBOR will likely ultimately cease to exist. To facilitate an orderly transition from LIBOR to alternative benchmark rate(s), John Deere and the Company established an initiative led by internal subject matter experts to assess and mitigate risks associated with the discontinuation of LIBOR. As part of this initiative, several alternative benchmark rates have been, and continue to be, evaluated. At this time, however, the effects of the phase out of LIBOR and the adoption of alternative benchmark rates have not been fully determined. Any new benchmark rate will likely not replicate LIBOR exactly, which could affect the Company s contracts that mature after a LIBOR cessation date. In addition, there is uncertainty about how applicable laws, the courts, or the Company will address the replacement of LIBOR with alternative rates on variable-rate contracts that do 
 17 

Table of Contents 
 not include, or contain unclear, alternative rate fallback provisions. A failure to properly transition away from LIBOR could expose the Company to various financial, operational, and regulatory risks, which could affect the Company s results of operations and cash flows. Uncertainty as to the nature of such potential changes may also adversely affect the trading market for the Company s securities. Market Conditions John Deere s ability to adapt in highly competitive markets could affect its business, results of operations, and financial condition. John Deere operates in a variety of highly competitive global and regional markets. John Deere competes worldwide with a number of other manufacturers and distributors that produce and sell similar products. John Deere competes on the basis of product performance, innovation and quality, distribution, customer service, and price. Aggressive pricing or other strategies pursued by competitors, unanticipated product or manufacturing delays, or John Deere s failure to price its products competitively could adversely affect John Deere s business, results of operations, and financial condition, which could have a negative effect on the Company s results. John Deere s ability to understand its customers specific preferences and requirements, and to develop, manufacture, and market products that meet customer demand, could significantly affect its business results. John Deere s ability to match new product offerings to diverse global customers anticipated preferences for different types and sizes of equipment and various equipment features and functionality, at affordable prices, is critical to its success. This requires a thorough understanding of John Deere s existing and potential customers on a global basis. Failure to deliver quality products that meet customer needs at competitive prices ahead of competitors could have a significant adverse effect on John Deere s business, which could have a negative effect on the Company s results. Changing worldwide demand for food and different forms of bio-energy could affect the price of farm commodities and consequently the demand for certain John Deere equipment and could also result in higher research and development costs related to changing machine fuel requirements. Changing worldwide demand for farm outputs to meet the world s growing food and bio-energy demands, driven in part by government policies, including those related to climate change, and a growing world population, are likely to result in fluctuating agricultural commodity prices, which directly affect sales of agricultural equipment. Lower agricultural commodity prices directly affect farm incomes, which could negatively affect sales of agricultural equipment and result in higher credit losses. While higher commodity prices benefit John Deere s crop-producing agricultural equipment customers, higher commodity prices also could result in greater feed costs for livestock and poultry producers, which in turn may result in lower levels of equipment purchased by these customers. Furthermore, changing bio-energy demands may cause farmers to change the types or quantities of the crops they raise, with corresponding changes in equipment demands. Finally, changes in governmental policies regulating bio-fuel utilization could affect commodity demand and commodity prices, demand for John Deere s diesel-fueled equipment, and result in higher research and development costs for John Deere related to equipment fuel standards. These changes could have a negative effect on the Company s results. Data Security and Privacy Risks Security breaches and other disruptions to the Company s information technology infrastructure could interfere with the Company s operations and could compromise the information of the Company as well as its customers and/or John Deere dealers, exposing the Company to liability that could cause the Company s business and reputation to suffer. In the ordinary course of business, the Company relies upon information technology networks and systems, some of which are managed by third parties, to process, transmit, and store electronic information and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities, including loan application and collection of payments from dealers and other purchasers of John Deere equipment. The Company uses information technology systems to record, process, and summarize financial information and results of operations for internal reporting purposes and to comply with regulatory financial reporting, legal, and tax requirements. Additionally, the Company collects and stores sensitive data, including intellectual property, proprietary business information, and the proprietary business information of the Company s 
 18 

Table of Contents 
 customers and John Deere dealers, as well as personally identifiable information of the Company s customers and employees, in data centers, which are often owned by third parties, and on information technology networks. The secure operation of these information technology networks and the processing and maintenance of this information is critical to the Company s business operations and strategy. Despite security measures, including a vulnerability disclosure program, and business continuity plans, the Company s information technology networks and infrastructure have been and may be vulnerable to damage, disruptions, or shutdowns due to attacks by cyber criminals or breaches due to employee, supplier, or dealer error or malfeasance or other disruptions during the process of upgrading or replacing computer software or hardware, power outages, computer viruses, telecommunication or utility failures, terrorist acts, natural disasters, or other catastrophic events. Although the Company has not suffered any significant cyber incidents that resulted in a material business impact, it has from time to time been the target of malicious cyber threat actors. The occurrence of any significant event could compromise the Company s networks, and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. Any such access, disclosure, or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability, or regulatory penalties under laws protecting the privacy of personal information, disruption to the Company s operations, and damage the Company s reputation, which could adversely affect the Company s business, results of operations, and financial condition. In addition, as security threats continue to evolve and increase in frequency and sophistication, the Company may need to invest additional resources to protect the security of its systems. The Company is subject to governmental laws, regulations, and other legal obligations related to privacy and data protection and any inability or perceived inability of the Company to address these requirements could adversely affect our business. The legislative and regulatory framework for privacy and data protection issues worldwide is rapidly evolving and is likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future. The Company collects personal information and other data as integral parts of its business processes and activities. This data is subject to a variety of U.S. and foreign laws and regulations, including oversight by various regulatory and other governmental bodies. Many foreign countries and governmental bodies, including the European Union and other relevant jurisdictions where the Company conducts business, have laws and regulations concerning the collection and use of personal information and other data obtained from their residents or by businesses operating within their jurisdictions. The European Union General Data Protection Regulation and the California Consumer Privacy Act, among others, impose stringent data protection requirements and provide significant penalties for noncompliance. New privacy laws will continue to come into effect around the world in the future. Any inability or perceived inability to adequately address privacy and data protection concerns, even if unfounded, or comply with applicable laws, regulations, policies, industry standards, contractual obligations, or other legal obligations could result in additional cost and liability to the Company or Company officials, damage our reputation, inhibit sales, and otherwise adversely affect our business. Human Capital Risks The Company s ability to attract, develop, engage, and retain qualified employees could affect its ability to execute its strategy. The Company s continued success depends, in part, on its ability to identify and attract qualified candidates with the requisite education, background, and experience as well as its ability to develop, engage, and retain qualified employees. Failure to attract, develop, engage and retain qualified employees, whether as a result of an insufficient number of qualified applicants, difficulty in recruiting new employees, or inadequate resources to train, integrate, and retain qualified employees, could impair the Company s ability to execute its business strategy, and could adversely affect the Company s business. In addition, while the Company strives to reduce the impact of the departure of employees, the Company s operations or ability to execute its business strategy and meet its business objectives may be affected by the loss of employees, particularly when departures involve larger numbers of employees, such as those the Company could experience if a surge occurs in the number of employees voluntarily leaving their jobs similar to that experienced by other employers and industries since 2020. Higher rates of employee separations may adversely affect the Company through decreased employee morale, the loss of knowledge of departing employees, and the devotion of resources to recruiting and onboarding new employees.

 Disputes with labor unions have adversely affected John Deere s ability to operate its facilities as well as its financial results. Many of John Deere s production and maintenance employees are represented by labor unions under various collective bargaining agreements with different expiration dates. The failure of John Deere to successfully renegotiate labor agreements as they expire has from time to time led, and could in the future lead, to work stoppages or other disputes with labor unions. Disruptions to John Deere s manufacturing and parts-distribution facilities, through various forms of labor disputes, adversely affect John Deere and the Company. On October 14, 2021, after employees represented by the International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America (UAW) failed to approve a new collective bargaining agreement between John Deere and the UAW, the UAW initiated a labor strike affecting more than 10,000 workers at 14 John Deere facilities across the U.S., which adversely affected John Deere s operations in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021. The strike ended after a new collective bargaining agreement was approved on November 17, 2021. The UAW strike is expected to have an adverse effect on John Deere s results of operations for the three months ending January 30, 2022 as a result of reduced production and shipments. Any strike, work stoppage, or other dispute with a labor union distracts management from operating the business, may displace employees from ordinary job positions to fill in vacant positions, may affect John Deere s reputation, and could materially adversely affect John Deere s business, which could have a negative effect on the Company. Environmental, Climate, and Weather Risks Unfavorable weather conditions or natural calamities that reduce agricultural production and demand for agriculture and turf equipment could directly and indirectly affect John Deere s and the Company s business. Poor or unusual weather conditions, particularly during the planting and early growing season, can significantly affect the purchasing decisions of John Deere s customers, particularly the purchasers of agriculture and turf equipment. The timing and quantity of rainfall are two of the most important factors in agricultural production. Insufficient levels of rain prevent farmers from planting new crops and may cause growing crops to die or result in lower yields. Excessive rain or flooding can prevent planting from occurring at optimal times and may cause crop loss through increased disease or mold growth. Temperatures outside normal ranges can also cause crop failure or decreased yields, and may also affect disease incidence. Temperature affects the rate of growth, maturity, and quality of crops. Natural calamities such as regional floods, hurricanes or other storms, droughts, diseases, and pests can have significant negative effects on agricultural and livestock production. The resulting negative impact on farm income can strongly affect demand for agricultural equipment and the financial condition and credit risk of our customers and John Deere s dealers. Adverse weather conditions in a particular geographic region, particularly during the important spring selling season, may adversely affect sales of some turf equipment. Drought conditions can adversely affect sales of certain mowing equipment and unusually rainy weather can similarly cause lower sales volumes. Increasingly rigorous environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations of federal, state, and local authorities in the U.S. and various regulatory authorities in other jurisdictions apply to John Deere s and the Company s operations, suppliers, and customers, and enforcement actions or civil litigation related to those requirements could adversely affect John Deere s and the Company s business results. Enforcement actions arising from violations of environmental, health, and safety laws or regulations can lead to investigations and legal costs and result in significant fines or penalties. In addition, new or more stringent requirements of governmental authorities, including with respect to disclosure relating to climate change risks, could prevent or restrict John Deere s operations, or those of John Deere s suppliers and customers, require significant expenditures to achieve compliance, and/or give rise to civil or criminal liability. Further, civil litigation on these subjects continues to increase, primarily in the U.S. There can be no assurance that violations of such laws and/or regulations, civil claims for damages to property or personal injury arising from the environmental, health, or safety impacts of John Deere s or the Company s operations, or those of John Deere s suppliers and customers, or other civil claims in which John Deere or the Company becomes a party, would not have consequences that result in a material adverse effect on John Deere s and the Company s business, results of operations, or financial condition.

 Governmental actions designed to address climate change and the emergence of new technologies and business models in connection with the transition to a lower-carbon economy could adversely affect John Deere and its customers. The physical effects attributed to climate change could further impact John Deere s facilities, suppliers, and customers. There is global scientific consensus that emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG) continue to alter the composition of Earth s atmosphere in ways that are affecting and are expected to continue to affect the global climate. These considerations may lead to new international, national, regional, or local legislative or regulatory responses. Various stakeholders, including legislators and regulators, shareholders, and non-governmental organizations, as well as companies in many business sectors, including John Deere and the Company, are continuing to look for ways to reduce GHG emissions. The regulation of GHG emissions from certain stationary or mobile sources or the imposition of carbon pricing mechanisms could result in additional costs to John Deere and the Company in the form of taxes or emission allowances, facilities improvements, and energy costs, which would increase John Deere s and the Company s operating costs through higher utility, transportation, and materials costs. Increased input costs, such as fuel and fertilizer, and compliance-related costs could also affect customer operations and demand for John Deere equipment. Because the impact of any future climate change-related legislative, regulatory, or product standard requirements on John Deere s and the Company s global businesses and products is dependent on the timing and design of mandates or standards, the Company is unable to predict their potential impact at this time. Customer preferences in the markets served by John Deere could change as these markets transition to less carbon-intensive business models. Demand for electric agricultural, turf, and construction equipment could rise. The development of alternative farming techniques, carbon sequestration technologies, and new low-carbon biofuels could change farmers business models and equipment needs. If John Deere fails to properly develop or invest in new technologies to meet changing customer demands, John Deere will be at risk of losing potential sources of revenue, which could affect the Company s future financial results. The potential physical impacts of climate change on John Deere s facilities, suppliers, and customers and therefore on John Deere s and the Company s operations are highly uncertain and will be particular to the circumstances developing in various geographic regions. These may include extreme weather events and long-term changes in temperature levels and water availability. These potential physical effects may adversely affect the demand for John Deere s products and the financial performance of John Deere s and the Company s operations. Legal and Regulatory Risks The Company s global operations are subject to complex and changing laws and regulations, the violation of which could expose the Company to potential liabilities, increased costs, and other adverse effects. The Company s global operations are subject to numerous international, federal, state, and local laws and regulations, many of which are complex, frequently changing, and subject to varying interpretations. These laws and regulations cover a broad spectrum of subject areas, including advertising; anti money laundering; antitrust; consumer finance; environmental, health, and safety, including proper handling of electronic waste, recycling, and climate change; foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions; foreign ownership and investment; human rights, labor, and employment; and data privacy. These laws may vary substantially within the different markets in which the Company operates. Compliance with these laws and regulations is costly and may further increase the cost of conducting the Company s global operations. In addition, the Company must comply with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and all applicable foreign anti-corruption laws, including the U.K. Bribery Act, which generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments or providing anything of value to improperly influence government officials or private individuals for the purpose of obtaining or retaining a business advantage, regardless of whether those practices are legal or culturally expected in a particular jurisdiction. Although the Company has a compliance program in place designed to reduce the likelihood of potential violations of such laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that the Company s employees, contractors, or agents will not violate such laws and regulations or the Company s policies and procedures. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in criminal or civil sanctions and have a materially adverse effect on the Company s reputation, business, results of operations, and financial condition. Changes to existing laws and regulations or changes to how they are interpreted or the implementation of new, more stringent laws or regulations could adversely affect the Company s business by increasing compliance costs, limiting 
 21

 the Company s ability to offer a product or service, requiring changes to the Company s business practices, or otherwise making the Company s products and services less attractive to customers. Legislative and regulatory changes and other actions that could potentially affect the Company s business may be announced with little or no advance notice and the Company may not be able to effectively mitigate all adverse effects from such measures. Strategic Performance Risks The Company may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of its business strategies or these benefits may take longer to realize than expected. The Company may not realize all anticipated benefits of its recent reorganization and the implementation of its operating model within the anticipated timeframe or at all. Factors that could affect these benefits include the adoption of new job types within the Company, changing job responsibilities of employees, the number of layers of management, the ability of employees to embrace change, anxiety within the workforce, and temporary inefficiencies. Further, the ability of John Deere to execute its business strategies in production systems, precision technologies, and aftermarket support could affect John Deere s and the Company s results of operations and financial condition. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments. None. Item 2. Properties.

 Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The following Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD A) is intended to promote understanding of the financial condition and results of operations. The MD A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K). Results of Operations Overview Organization The Company primarily generates revenues and cash by financing John Deere dealers sales and leases of new and used production and precision agriculture, small agriculture and turf, and construction and forestry equipment. In addition, the Company also provides wholesale financing to dealers of the foregoing equipment and finances retail revolving charge accounts. Trends and Economic Conditions The Company s acquisition volume of Receivables and Leases is largely dependent upon the level of retail sales and leases of John Deere products. The level of John Deere retail sales and leases is responsive to a variety of economic, financial, climatic, legislative, and other factors that influence demand for its products. John Deere s production and precision agriculture equipment and small agriculture and turf equipment sales both increased 27 percent in 2021. Industry sales of large agricultural machinery in the U.S. and Canada for 2022 are forecasted to increase approximately 15 percent compared to 2021. Industry sales of small agricultural and turf equipment in the U.S. and Canada are expected to be flat in 2022. Industry sales of agricultural machinery in Europe are forecasted to be about 5 percent higher. South American industry sales of tractors and combines are forecasted to be roughly 5 percent higher in 2022. Asia industry sales are forecasted to be nearly the same in 2022 as in 2021. John Deere s construction and forestry sales increased 27 percent in 2021. On an industry basis, North American construction equipment and compact construction equipment sales are both expected to be 5 to 10 percent higher in 2022. Global forestry industry sales are projected to increase 10 to 15 percent. Results for the full-year fiscal 2022 for financial services, including the Company, are expected to be slightly lower due to a higher provision for credit losses, lower gains on operating lease residual values, and higher selling, general, and administrative expenses. These factors are expected to be partially offset by income earned on a higher average portfolio. Items of concern that could affect the Company s results of operations and liquidity and capital resources include uncertainty of the effectiveness of governmental and private sector actions to address COVID, trade agreements, the uncertainty of the results of monetary and fiscal policies, the impact of elevated levels of sovereign and state debt, capital market disruptions, changes in demand and pricing for new and used equipment, geopolitical events, and the other items discussed in the Safe Harbor Statement below. Significant fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and volatility in the price of many commodities could also impact John Deere s and the Company s results. The future financial effects of COVID continue to be unknown due to many factors. As a result of these uncertainties, predicting the Company s forecasted financial performance is subject to many assumptions. John Deere s 2021 full-year performance reflects strong end-market demand and the ability of John Deere s dedicated employees, dealers, and suppliers throughout the world, who have helped safely maintain operations, manage supply-chain challenges, and continue to serve customers throughout the COVID pandemic. Demand for farm and construction equipment is expected to continue to benefit from positive fundamentals, including favorable crop prices, economic growth, and increased investment in infrastructure. While supply-chain pressures are expected to persist into at least the early part of fiscal year 2022, John Deere is working closely with key suppliers to secure the parts and components that customers need in order to deliver essential food and infrastructure more profitably and sustainably.

 COVID Effects and Actions During 2020 and to a lesser extent in 2021, the effects of COVID and the related actions of governments and other authorities to contain COVID affected and continue to affect the Company s operations, results, cash flows, and forecasts. The Company s first priority in addressing the effects of COVID continues to be the health, safety, and overall welfare of its employees. The Company effectively activated previously established business continuity plans and proactively implemented health and safety measures at its operations around the world. The Company continued to work closely with its customers, including John Deere dealers and retail customers, in 2021 in connection with short-term payment relief on obligations owed to the Company. Receivables and Leases granted relief since the beginning of the pandemic that remained outstanding at October 31, 2021 represented approximately 2 percent of the Receivable and Lease portfolio (see Notes 5 and 7). 2021 Compared with 2020 The total revenues and net income attributable to the Company were as follows (in millions of dollars): 

2021 2020 Total revenues 2,688.0 2,807.6 Net income attributable to the Company 710.6 425.0 Total revenues decreased in 2021 primarily due to lower average financing rates, partially offset by a higher average portfolio and net gains on operating lease dispositions in the current year. Net income in 2021 was higher than in 2020 due to improvements on operating lease residual values, a lower provision for credit losses, favorable financing spreads, and income earned on a higher average portfolio. 2020 results also included impairments on lease residual values (see Note 7).

Table of Contents 
 Revenues The finance income and lease revenues earned by the Company were as follows (in millions of dollars): 

2021 2020 Change Finance income earned from: Retail notes 946.6 941.4 1 Revolving charge accounts 298.1 333.8 (11) Wholesale receivables 299.8 385.0 (22) Lease revenues 1,022.0 1,088.9 (6) Other income 121.5 58.5 108 Finance income on retail notes increased slightly in 2021 due to a higher average portfolio, partially offset by lower average financing rates. Finance income on revolving charge accounts and wholesale receivables decreased in 2021 primarily due to lower average financing rates and lower average portfolios. Lease revenues decreased primarily due to lower average portfolio balances. Revenues earned from John Deere totaled 613.7 million in 2021, compared with 669.5 million in 2020. The decrease was primarily the result of lower compensation paid by John Deere for waived or reduced finance charges on wholesale receivables due to lower average financing rates and a lower average portfolio. Revenues earned from John Deere are included in the revenue amounts discussed above and in other income. Other income increased in 2021 primarily due to net gains on operating lease residual values, which had been revised downward over the term of the leases. Better than expected conditions in the agriculture and turf and the construction and forestry markets led to favorable results when the matured lease equipment was sold. The Company recognized net losses on operating lease dispositions in 2020, which were recorded in administrative and operating expenses. In addition, 2021 benefited from freestanding credit enhancement recoveries (see Note 5), partially offset by lower interest income. Expenses Significant expenses incurred by the Company were as follows (in millions of dollars): 

2021 2020 Change Interest expense 472.9 743.9 (36) Depreciation of equipment on operating leases 733.4 845.1 (13) Administrative and operating expenses 406.0 470.6 (14) Fees paid to John Deere 168.3 101.6 66 Provision (credit) for credit losses (.9) 89.4 Provision for income taxes 200.5 134.1 50 The decrease in interest expense was primarily due to lower average borrowing rates. The depreciation of equipment on operating leases decreased primarily due to updated depreciation estimates and lower average balances of equipment on operating leases. The decrease in administrative and operating expenses was primarily due to losses and impairments on operating lease residual values recorded in 2020 (see Note 7). In 2021, the Company recognized net gains on the sale of operating lease equipment in other income. 2020 was also impacted by employee-separation expenses (see Note 22). Fees paid to John Deere increased in 2021 primarily due to higher interest on intercompany borrowings from John Deere as a result of higher average borrowings and higher interest rates in certain international markets, in addition to higher corporate support fees. The provision (credit) for credit losses decreased in 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due to lower expected losses on retail notes and financing leases caused by improving conditions in the construction and forestry market and better than expected performance of accounts granted payment relief due to the economic effects of COVID. The provision 
 25 

Table of Contents 
 (credit) for credit losses also decreased on revolving charge accounts in 2021, reflecting strong payment performance due to continued improvements in the agriculture and turf market. In addition to the factors noted above, the 2020 provision also included an increase in the allowance for credit losses related to the negative economic effects of COVID and other macroeconomic issues. The provision for credit losses, as a percentage of the total average balance of Receivables financed, was zero for 2021 and .27 percent for 2020. The higher provision for income taxes in 2021 was primarily related to higher pretax income in the current year, partially offset by a lower effective tax rate. See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Receivables and Leases Acquired and Held For the fiscal years ended October 31, 2021 and November 1, 2020, Receivable and Lease (excluding wholesale) acquisition volumes and balances held were as follows (in millions of dollars): 

Fiscal Year Volumes Fiscal Year End Balances 2021 2020 Change 2021 2020 Change Retail notes: Agriculture and turf 12,085.1 9,581.7 26 21,518.9 18,031.0 19 Construction and forestry 2,812.2 2,175.1 29 4,487.0 3,816.2 18 Total retail notes 14,897.3 11,756.8 27 26,005.9 21,847.2 19 Revolving charge accounts 6,886.0 6,833.4 1 3,740.1 3,827.4 (2) Financing leases 655.4 490.6 34 972.3 789.4 23 Equipment on operating leases 1,832.5 1,911.8 (4) 4,947.6 5,297.8 (7) Total Receivables and Leases (excluding wholesale) 24,271.2 20,992.6 16 35,665.9 31,761.8 12 Retail notes bearing fixed finance rates totaled over 95 percent of the total retail note portfolio at October 31, 2021 and November 1, 2020. Total Receivables 30 days or more past due, non-performing Receivables, and the allowance for credit losses were as follows (in millions of dollars and as a percentage of the Receivables balance): 

2021 2020 Dollars Percent Dollars Percent Receivables 30 days or more past due 340.8 .93 311.9 .93 Non-performing Receivables 280.1 .76 262.5 .78 Allowance for credit losses 129.0 .35 129.1 .38 The delinquency status of Receivables granted relief due to COVID is based on the modified payment schedule (see Note 5). Receivables 30 days or more past due continue to accrue finance income. The Company ceases to accrue finance income once Receivables are considered non-performing. An allowance for credit losses is recorded for the estimated credit losses expected over the life of the Receivable portfolio. The Company measures expected credit losses on a collective basis when similar risk characteristics exist. Risk characteristics considered by the Company include product category, market, geography, credit risk, and remaining duration. Receivables that do not share risk characteristics with other receivables in the portfolio are evaluated on an individual basis. While the Company believes its allowance is sufficient to provide for losses over the life of its existing Receivable portfolio, different assumptions or changes in economic conditions would result in changes to the allowance for credit losses and the provision for credit losses. See Note 5 for additional information related to the allowance for credit losses.

 Deposits withheld from dealers and merchants amounted to 131.8 million at October 31, 2021, compared with 114.8 million at November 1, 2020. These balances primarily represent the aggregate dealer retail note and lease withholding accounts from individual John Deere dealers to which losses from retail notes and leases originating from the respective dealers can be charged. Upon the adoption of ASU No. 2016-13, recoveries from dealer deposits are recognized in other income when the dealer s withholding account is charged. During 2021, 14.3 million was recorded in other income related to recoveries from dealer deposits and other freestanding credit enhancements. Prior to the adoption of ASU No. 2016-13, the benefit of credit losses recovered from freestanding credit enhancements, such as dealer deposits, was recognized in the provision for credit losses based on estimated recoveries. 2020 Compared with 2019 The comparison of the 2020 results with 2019 can be found under the heading 2020 Compared with 2019 in the Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section of the Company s 2020 Form 10-K . Capital Resources and Liquidity The cash provided by operating and financing activities was used primarily to fund Receivables and Leases. Cash provided by operating activities was 1,365.9 million in 2021. Cash provided by financing activities totaled 2,026.2 million, resulting primarily from a net increase in total external borrowings of 2,152.1 million and a net increase in notes payables to John Deere of 392.8 million, partially offset by dividends paid of 485.0 million. Cash used for investing activities totaled 3,391.7 million in 2021, primarily due to the cost of Receivables acquired (excluding wholesale) exceeding the collections of Receivables (excluding wholesale) by 4,290.6 million, and the cost of equipment on operating leases acquired exceeding the proceeds from sales of equipment on operating leases by 276.6 million, partially offset by a decrease in net wholesale receivables of 1,197.1 million. Cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash increased 3.4 million during 2021. Over the last three years, operating activities have provided 4,576.2 million in cash. In addition, an increase in total borrowings of 5,178.6 million provided cash inflows. These amounts have been used mainly to fund Receivable and Lease acquisitions, which exceeded collections of Receivables and proceeds from sale of equipment on operating leases by 8,212.2 million, and to pay 1,090.0 million in dividends. Cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash increased 61.0 million over the three-year period. The Company relies on its ability to raise substantial amounts of funds to finance its Receivable and Lease portfolios. The Company has access to most global markets at reasonable costs and expects to have sufficient sources of global funding and liquidity to meet its funding needs in the short term and long term. The Company s ability to meet its debt obligations is supported in several ways. The assets of the Company are self-liquidating in nature. A solid equity position is available to absorb unusual losses on these assets and all commercial paper is backed by unsecured, committed borrowing lines from various banks. Liquidity is also provided by the Company s ability to securitize these assets and through the issuance of term debt. Additionally, liquidity may be provided through loans from John Deere. The Company s commercial paper outstanding at October 31, 2021 and November 1, 2020 was 662.9 million and 125.0 million, respectively, while the total cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities position was 679.1 million and 676.8 million, respectively. The amount of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities held by foreign subsidiaries was 158.0 million and 163.7 million at October 31, 2021 and November 1, 2020, respectively. The Company has a revolving credit agreement to utilize bank conduit facilities to securitize retail notes (see Note 6). At October 31, 2021, the revolving credit agreement had a total capacity, or financing limit, of 2,000.0 million of secured financings at any time. 1,572.3 million of short-term securitization borrowings were outstanding under the agreement at October 31, 2021. At the end of the contractual revolving period, unless the banks and the Company agree to renew, the Company would liquidate the secured borrowings over time as payments on the retail notes are collected. The agreement was renewed in November 2021 with an expiration in November 2022 and a capacity of 1,000.0 million. As a result of the reduced capacity, 511.1 million of outstanding short-term securitization borrowings were repurchased by the Company in November 2021, in addition to the normal monthly liquidations as a result of payments collected on the retail notes.

 During 2021, the Company issued 7,418.3 million and retired 5,710.4 million of long-term external borrowings, which primarily consisted of medium-term notes. During 2021, the Company also issued 2,800.8 million and retired 2,861.5 million of retail note securitization borrowings and maintained an average commercial paper balance of 902.1 million. At October 31, 2021, the Company s funding profile included 678.9 million of commercial paper and other notes payable, 4,595.2 million of securitization borrowings, 5,619.4 million of notes payable to John Deere, 26,426.4 million of unsecured term debt, and 4,526.2 million of equity capital. The Company s funding profile may be altered to reflect such factors as relative costs of funding sources, assets available for securitizations, and capital market accessibility. Total interest-bearing indebtedness amounted to 37,319.9 million at October 31, 2021, compared with 35,145.9 million at November 1, 2020. Total external short-term indebtedness amounted to 11,093.2 million at October 31, 2021, compared with 10,585.3 million at November 1, 2020. Total external long-term indebtedness amounted to 20,607.3 million at October 31, 2021, compared with 19,311.1 million at November 1, 2020. Total notes payable to John Deere amounted to 5,619.4 million at October 31, 2021, compared with 5,249.5 million at November 1, 2020. The ratio of total interest-bearing debt, including securitization indebtedness, to stockholder s equity was 8.2 to 1 at October 31, 2021 and November 1, 2020. Stockholder s equity was 4,526.2 million at October 31, 2021, compared with 4,298.2 million at November 1, 2020. The increase in 2021 was primarily due to net income attributable to the Company of 710.6 million, a change in the cumulative translation adjustment of 15.0 million, and unrealized gains on derivatives of 13.5 million, partially offset by dividend payments of 485.0 million and reductions resulting from the adoption of ASU No. 2016-13 of 26.2 million. Capital Corporation declared and paid cash dividends to JDFS of 485.0 million in 2021 and 275.0 million in 2020. In turn, JDFS paid comparable dividends to Deere Company. Contractual Obligations and Cash Requirements The Company s material contractual cash obligations relate to borrowings, including securitization borrowings. As of October 31, 2021, the Company had 14,081.3 million of principal payments on borrowings and securitization borrowings payable in the next year, along with interest payments of 428.0 million. The securitization borrowing payments are based on the expected liquidation of the related retail notes securitized as well as the repurchase due to the reduced facility capacity (see Note 25). The Company s borrowings will likely be replaced with new borrowings to finance the Receivables and Leases portfolio. See Notes 8, 9, and 10 for further detail regarding future contractual payments on intercompany borrowings, securitization borrowings, and long-term external borrowings. Lines of Credit The Company has access to bank lines of credit with various banks throughout the world. Some of the lines are available to both the Company and Deere Company. Worldwide lines of credit totaled 8,016.0 million at October 31, 2021, 5,770.3 million of which were unused. For the purpose of computing the unused credit lines, commercial paper and short-term bank borrowings, excluding secured borrowings and the current portion of long-term external borrowings, of the Company and John Deere were considered to constitute utilization. Included in the total credit lines at October 31, 2021 was a 364-day credit facility agreement of 3,000.0 million, expiring in fiscal April 2022. In addition, total credit lines included long-term credit facility agreements of 2,500.0 million, expiring in fiscal April 2025, and 2,500.0 million, expiring in fiscal March 2026. The agreements are mutually extendable and the annual facility fees are not significant. These credit agreements require the Company to maintain its consolidated ratio of earnings to fixed charges at not less than 1.05 to 1 for each fiscal quarter and its ratio of senior debt, excluding securitization indebtedness, to capital base (total subordinated debt and stockholder s equity excluding accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)) at not more than 11 to 1 at the end of any fiscal quarter. All of the requirements of the credit agreements have been met during the periods included in the consolidated financial statements.

 Debt Ratings The Company s ability to obtain funding is affected by its debt ratings, which are closely related to the outlook for and the financial condition of John Deere, and the nature and availability of support facilities, such as its lines of credit and the support agreement with Deere Company. To access public debt capital markets, the Company relies on credit rating agencies to assign short-term and long-term credit ratings to the Company s securities as an indicator of credit quality for fixed income investors. A securities rating is not a recommendation by the rating agency to buy, sell, or hold the Company s securities. A credit rating agency may change or withdraw Company ratings based on its assessment of the Company s current and future ability to meet interest and principal repayment obligations. Each agency s rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Lower credit ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs, including costs of derivative transactions, and reduced access to debt capital markets. The senior long-term and short-term debt ratings and outlook currently assigned to unsecured Company debt securities by the rating agencies engaged by the Company are the same as those for John Deere. Those ratings are as follows: 

Senior Long-Term Short-Term Outlook Fitch Ratings A F1 Stable Moody s Investors Service, Inc. A2 Prime-1 Stable Standard Poor s A A-1 Stable Critical Accounting Estimates The preparation of the Company s consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could have a significant effect on the financial statements. The accounting policies below are those management believes are the most critical to the preparation of the Company s financial statements and require the most difficult, subjective, or complex judgments. The Company s other accounting policies are described in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Allowance for Credit Losses The allowance for credit losses is an estimate of the credit losses expected over the life of the Company s Receivable portfolio. The allowance is measured on a collective basis when similar risk characteristics exist. Risk characteristics considered by the Company include product category, market, geography, credit risk, and remaining duration. Receivables that do not share risk characteristics with other receivables in the portfolio are evaluated on an individual basis. Non-performing Receivables are included in the estimate of expected credit losses. The Company utilizes loss forecast models, which are selected based on the size and credit risk of the underlying pool of receivables, to estimate expected credit losses. Transition matrix models are used for large and complex Customer Receivable pools, while weighted-average remaining maturity models are used for smaller and less complex Customer Receivable pools. Expected credit losses on wholesale receivables are based on historical loss rates, with consideration of current economic conditions and dealer financial risk. The modeled expected credit losses are adjusted based on reasonable and supportable forecasts, which may include economic indicators such as commodity prices, industry equipment sales, unemployment rates, and housing starts. Management reviews each model s output quarterly, and qualitative adjustments are incorporated as necessary. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. In 2021, the Company adopted ASU No. 2016-13, which revised the measurement of credit losses from an incurred loss to an expected loss methodology. Upon adoption, the Company s allowance for credit losses increased 19.7 million with an offset to retained earnings (see Note 3). The allowance for credit losses at November 1, 2020 and November 3, 2019 were not restated under the expected loss methodology. The total allowance for credit losses at October 31, 2021, November 1, 2020, and November 3, 2019 was 129.0 million, 129.1 million, and 100.6 million, respectively. Subsequent to the adoption of ASU No. 2016-13, the allowance decreased 19.8 million during 2021, primarily due to lower expected losses in the construction and forestry market, continued improvement in the agriculture

 and turf market, and better than expected performance of accounts granted payment relief due to the economic effects of COVID. These decreases were partially offset by growth in the retail notes and financing leases portfolio (see Note 5). The allowance increase in 2020 was primarily due to the negative economic effects related to COVID and other macroeconomic issues, which significantly affected certain retail borrowers, particularly of construction equipment. The assumptions used in evaluating the Company s exposure to credit losses involve estimates and significant judgment. While the Company believes its allowance is sufficient to provide for losses over the life of its existing Receivables portfolio, different assumptions or changes in economic conditions would result in changes to the allowance for credit losses. Historically, changes in economic conditions have had limited impact on credit losses within the Company s wholesale receivable portfolio. Within the Customer Receivables portfolio, credit loss estimates are dependent on a number of factors, including historical portfolio performance, current delinquency levels, and estimated recoveries on defaulted accounts. The Company s transition matrix models, which are utilized to estimate credit losses for more than 90 percent of Customer Receivables, use historical portfolio performance and current delinquency levels to forecast future defaults. Estimated recovery rates are applied to the estimated default balance to calculate the expected credit losses. Holding all other factors constant, a 10 percent increase in the transition matrix models forecasted defaults as a result of elevated levels of delinquencies, deteriorating roll rates, or otherwise, and a simultaneous 10 percent decrease in recovery rates would have resulted in an increase to the allowance for credit losses of approximately 30 million at October 31, 2021. Operating Lease Residual Values The carrying value of equipment on operating leases is affected by the estimated fair values of the equipment at the end of the lease (residual values). Upon termination of the lease, the equipment is either purchased by the lessee or sold to a third party, in which case the Company may record a gain or a loss for the difference between the estimated residual value and the sale price. The Company estimates residual values at the inception of the lease based on several factors, including lease term, expected hours of usage, historical wholesale sale prices, return experience, intended use of the equipment, market dynamics and trends, and third-party residual guarantees. The Company reviews residual value estimates during the lease term and tests the carrying value of its operating lease assets for impairment when events or circumstances necessitate. Changes in residual value assumptions would affect the amount of depreciation expense and the amount of investment in equipment on operating leases. Depreciation is adjusted prospectively on a straight-line basis over the remaining lease term if residual value estimates are revised. The total operating lease residual values at October 31, 2021, November 1, 2020, and November 3, 2019 were 3,547.6 million, and 3,826.3 million, and 3,876.5 million, respectively. The decrease in 2021 was primarily due to a lower operating lease portfolio. Estimates used in determining end-of-lease market values for equipment on operating leases significantly impact the amount and timing of depreciation expense. Hypothetically, if future market values for this equipment were to decrease 10 percent from the Company s present estimates and all the equipment on operating leases were returned to the Company for remarketing at the end of the lease term, the total impact would be to increase the Company s annual depreciation for equipment on operating leases by approximately 75 million, after consideration of dealer residual value guarantees. Safe Harbor Statement Safe Harbor Statement under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995: Statements under Business (including under Market Conditions ), Risk Factors, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (including under Overview and Trends and Economic Conditions ), and other forward-looking statements herein that relate to future events, expectations, and trends involve factors that are subject to change, and risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Factors that could materially affect the Company s operations, access to capital, expenses, and results include changes in, uncertainty surrounding, and the impact of governmental trade, banking, monetary, and fiscal policies, including financial regulatory reform and its effects on the consumer finance industry, derivatives, funding costs, and other areas. Actions by central banks and financial and securities regulators may affect the costs and expenses of financing the Company and the financing rates it is able to offer. The Company s business is affected by general economic conditions in the global markets in which the Company operates because deteriorating economic conditions and political instability can result in decreased customer confidence, lower demand for equipment, higher credit losses, and greater currency risk.

 The Company s business is also affected by changes in demand and pricing for used equipment and resulting impacts on lease residual values; actions of banks, financing and leasing companies, and other lenders that compete with the Company for customers; capital market disruptions; significant changes in capital market liquidity and associated funding costs; interest rates (including the availability of IBOR reference rates) and foreign currency exchange rates and their volatility; changes to accounting standards; changes in tax rates, estimates, laws, and regulations and Company actions related thereto; changes to and compliance with privacy, banking, and other regulations; changes to and compliance with economic sanctions and export controls laws and regulations; compliance with U.S. and foreign laws when expanding to new markets and otherwise; actions by other regulatory bodies; governmental programs, policies, and tariffs for the benefit of certain industries or sectors; sanctions in particular jurisdictions; retaliatory actions to such changes in trade, banking, monetary, and fiscal policies; the potential default of the U.S. federal government if Congress fails to pass a 2022 budget resolution; the political and social stability of the global markets in which the Company operates; changes in weather and climate patterns; the effects of, or response to, terrorism and security threats; wars and other conflicts; natural disasters; the spread of major epidemics or pandemics (including the COVID pandemic) and government and industry responses to epidemics or pandemics, such as travel restrictions and extended shut downs of businesses; events that damage the Company s reputation or brand; significant investigations, claims, lawsuits or other legal proceedings; success of business strategies; labor relations and contracts, including work stoppages and other disruptions; changes in the ability to attract, develop, engage, and retain qualified personnel; the implementation of the smart industrial operating model and other organizational changes; the failure to realize anticipated savings or benefits of cost reduction, productivity, or efficiency efforts; difficulties related to the conversion and implementation of the Company s information technology systems; and security breaches, cybersecurity attacks, technology failures and other disruptions to the information technology infrastructure of the Company and John Deere dealers. Continued uncertainties related to the magnitude, duration, and persistent effects of the COVID pandemic may significantly adversely affect John Deere s and the Company s business and outlook. These uncertainties include, among other things: the duration and impact of the resurgence in COVID cases in any country, state, or region; the emergence, contagiousness, and threat of new and different strains of virus; the availability, acceptance, and effectiveness of vaccines; additional closures as mandated or otherwise made necessary by governmental authorities; disruptions in the supply chain, including those caused by industry capacity constraints, material availability, and global logistics delays and constraints arising from, among other things, the transportation capacity of ocean shipping containers and a prolonged delay in resumption of operations by one or more of John Deere s key suppliers, or the failure of any key suppliers; an increasingly competitive labor market due to a sustained labor shortage or increased turnover caused by the COVID pandemic; additional operating costs due to continued remote working arrangements, adherence to social distancing guidelines, and other COVID-related challenges; increased risk of cyberattacks on network connections used in remote working arrangements; increased privacy-related risks due to processing health-related personal information; legal claims related to alleged exposure to COVID on Company premises; absence of employees due to illness; and the impact of the pandemic on the Company s customers and on John Deere dealers. The sustainability of the economic recovery observed in 2021 remains unclear and significant volatility could continue for a prolonged period. These factors, and others that are currently unknown or considered immaterial, could materially and adversely affect the Company s business, liquidity, results of operations, and financial position. Significant changes in market liquidity conditions, changes in the Company s credit ratings, and any failure to comply with financial covenants in credit agreements could impact access to funding and funding costs, which could reduce the Company s earnings and cash flows. Financial market conditions could also negatively impact customer access to capital for purchases of John Deere s products and customer confidence and purchase decisions, financing and repayment practices, and the number and size of customer delinquencies and defaults. A debt crisis in Europe, Latin America, or elsewhere could negatively impact currencies, global financial markets, social and political stability, funding sources and costs, asset and obligation values, customers, and Company operations and results. The Company s operations could be impaired by changes in the equity, bond, and other financial markets, which would negatively affect earnings. Continued effects of the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union could adversely affect business activity, political stability, and economic conditions in the United Kingdom, the European Union, and elsewhere. The economic conditions and outlook could be further adversely affected by (i) uncertainty regarding any new or modified trade arrangements between the United Kingdom and the European Union and/or other countries, (ii) the risk that one or more other European Union countries could come under increasing pressure to leave the European Union, or (iii) the risk 
 31

 that the euro as the single currency of the eurozone could cease to exist. Any of these developments could affect the Company s businesses, liquidity, results of operations, and financial position. The liquidity and ongoing profitability of the Company depend largely on timely access to capital in order to meet future cash flow requirements, and to fund operations, costs, and purchases of John Deere s products. If general economic conditions deteriorate or capital markets become more volatile, funding could be unavailable or insufficient. Additionally, customer confidence levels may result in declines in credit applications and increases in delinquencies and default rates, which could materially impact the Company s write-offs and provision for credit losses. The Company s forward-looking statements are based upon assumptions relating to the factors described above, which are sometimes based upon estimates and data prepared by government agencies. Such estimates and data are often revised. The Company, except as required by law, undertakes no obligation to update or revise its forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new developments or otherwise. In addition, the Company s business is closely related to John Deere s business. Further information, including factors that could materially affect the Company s and John Deere s financial results, is included in the most recent Deere Company Annual Report on Form 10-K (including, but not limited to, the factors discussed in Item 1A, Risk Factors of the Annual Report on Form 10-K) and other Deere Company and Capital Corporation quarterly and other filings with the SEC. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. Financial Instrument Market Risk Information The Company is naturally exposed to various interest rate and foreign currency risks. As a result, the Company enters into derivative transactions to manage certain of these exposures that arise in the normal course of business and not for the purpose of creating speculative positions or trading. The Company manages the relationships of the types and amounts of its funding sources to its Receivable and Lease portfolios in an effort to diminish risk due to interest rate and foreign currency fluctuations, while responding to favorable financing opportunities. Accordingly, from time to time, the Company enters into interest rate swap agreements to manage its interest rate exposure. The Company also has foreign currency exposures at some of its foreign and domestic operations related to financing in currencies other than the functional currencies. The Company has entered into agreements related to the management of these foreign currency transaction risks. Interest Rate Risk Quarterly, the Company uses a combination of cash flow models to assess the sensitivity of its financial instruments with interest rate exposure to changes in market interest rates. The models calculate the effect of adjusting interest rates as follows. Cash flows for Receivables are discounted at the current prevailing rate for each Receivable portfolio. Cash flows for unsecured borrowings are discounted at the applicable benchmark yield curve plus market credit spreads for similarly rated borrowers. Cash flows for securitized borrowings are discounted at the swap yield curve plus a market credit spread for similarly rated borrowers. Cash flows for interest rate swaps are projected and discounted using forward rates from the swap yield curve at the repricing dates. The net loss in these financial instruments fair values, which would be caused by increasing the interest rates by 10 percent from the market rates at October 31, 2021 and November 1, 2020, would have been approximately 101.9 million and 126.7 million, respectively. Foreign Currency Risk The Company s policy is to manage foreign currency risk through hedging strategies if the currency of the borrowings does not match the currency of the Receivable portfolio. As a result, a hypothetical 10 percent adverse change in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to all other foreign currencies would not have a material effect on the Company s cash flows.

Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure. Not applicable. Item 9A. Controls and Procedures. Disclosure Controls and Procedures The Company s principal executive officer and its principal financial officer have concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act)) were effective as of October 31, 2021, based on the evaluation of these controls and procedures required by Rule 13a-15(b) or 15d-15(b) of the Exchange Act. Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting The Company s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. The Company s internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of October 31, 2021, using the criteria set forth in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on that assessment, management believes that, as of October 31, 2021, the Company s internal control over financial reporting was effective. This Annual Report on Form 10-K does not include an attestation report of the Company s independent registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management s report was not subject to attestation by the Company s independent registered public accounting firm pursuant to rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission that permit the Company to provide only management s report in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting During the fourth quarter, there were no changes that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the stockholders and the Board of Directors of John Deere Capital Corporation: Opinion on the Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of John Deere Capital Corporation and subsidiaries (the Company as of October 31, 2021 and November 1, 2020, and the related statements of consolidated income, consolidated comprehensive income, changes in consolidated stockholder s equity, and consolidated cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended October 31, 2021, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements ).

Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit Matter The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. Allowance for Credit Losses Refer to Notes 2 and 5 to the financial statements Critical Audit Matter Description The allowance for credit losses as of October 31, 2021 was 129 million. The allowance for credit losses is an estimate of the credit losses expected over the life of the Company s receivable portfolio. The Company measures expected credit losses on a collective basis when similar risk characteristics exist. Risk characteristics considered by the Company include product category, market, geography, credit risk, and remaining duration. The Company utilizes loss forecast models, which are selected based on the size and credit risk of the underlying pool of receivables, to estimate expected credit losses. Transition matrix models, which are used for the majority of the customer receivables, use historical

 delinquency and default information to assign probabilities that a receivable will pay as contractually scheduled or become delinquent and advance through the various delinquency stages. The modeled expected credit losses are adjusted based on reasonable and supportable forecasts, which may include economic indicators such as commodity prices, industry equipment sales, unemployment rates, and housing starts. Management reviews each model s output quarterly, and qualitative adjustments are incorporated as necessary. We identified the allowance for credit losses as a critical audit matter because determining the appropriate methodology and assumptions used in the estimate requires significant judgment by management. Given the subjective nature and judgment applied by management to determine the allowance for credit losses, auditing the methodology and assumptions requires a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort, including the need to involve credit specialists. How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit Our audit procedures related to testing the Company s allowance for credit losses included the following, among others: 
 We tested the effectiveness of management s controls over the methodology, data and assumptions used to estimate the allowance for credit losses. We tested the accuracy and evaluated the relevance of the underlying historical data used in the Company s model. With the assistance of our credit specialists, we evaluated the reasonableness and accuracy of the models used to estimate the allowance for credit losses, including model assumptions and the selection and application of relevant risk characteristics and use of qualitative adjustments. We evaluated qualitative adjustments to the model estimate. Our evaluation included: o Comparison of qualitative factors used by the Company to source data provided by the Company and/or to externally available data o Consideration and evaluation of contradictory evidence We evaluated management s ability to accurately forecast credit losses by performing a retrospective review, which involved comparing actual credit losses to historical estimates.

Servicing and collection functions for a small portion of the Receivables and Leases held (less than percent) are provided by John Deere. John Deere is reimbursed for staff and other administrative services at estimated cost, and for credit lines provided to the Company based on utilization of those lines. In fiscal year 2021, John Deere implemented a new operating model and reporting structure. With this change, John Deere s agriculture and turf operations were divided into two new segments: production and precision agriculture and small agriculture and turf. There were no changes to John Deere s construction and forestry or financial services segments.

 , Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, which establishes Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 326, Financial Instruments Credit Losses. This ASU was adopted using a modified-retrospective approach. The ASU, along with related amendments, revised the measurement of credit losses for financial assets measured at amortized cost from an incurred loss to an expected loss methodology. The ASU affects receivables, debt securities, net investment in leases, and most other financial assets that represent a right to receive cash. The Company holds deposits from dealers (dealer deposits), which are recorded in deposits withheld from dealers and merchants, to absorb certain credit losses. Prior to adopting this ASU, the allowance for credit losses was estimated on probable credit losses incurred after consideration of recoveries from dealer deposits. The ASU considers dealer deposits and certain credit insurance contracts as freestanding credit enhancements. As a result, after adoption, credit losses recovered from dealer deposits and certain credit insurance contracts are presented in other income and no longer as part of the allowance for credit losses or the provision for credit losses. The ASU also modified the treatment of the estimated write-off on delinquent receivables by no longer including the estimated benefit of charges to the dealer deposits in the write-off amount (see Note 5). This change increases the estimated write-offs on delinquent financing receivables with the benefit of credit losses recovered from dealer deposits presented in other income. This benefit, in both situations, is recorded when the dealer deposits are charged and no longer based on estimated recoveries. ) ) Deferred income taxes Liabilities Accounts payable and accrued expenses ) Deposits withheld from dealers and merchants Deferred income taxes ) Stockholder s equity Retained earnings ) Note 5 contains additional disclosures as well as the Company s updated allowance for credit losses accounting policy.

During 2021, the average effective yield on retail notes held by the Company was approximately percent, compared with percent in 2020 and percent in 2019. Finance income on variable-rate retail notes is adjusted periodically based on the adjustment schedule and fluctuations in the applicable base rate specified in the respective contract. Net costs incurred in the acquisition of retail notes are deferred and recognized over the expected lives of the retail notes using the interest method. A portion of the finance income earned by the Company arises from financing of retail sales of John Deere equipment on which finance charges are waived or reduced by John Deere for a period from the date of the retail sale to a specified subsequent date. The Company receives compensation from John Deere equal to competitive market interest rates for periods during which finance charges have been waived or reduced. The Company computes the compensation from John Deere for waived or reduced finance charges based on the Company s estimated funding costs, administrative and operating expenses, credit losses, and required return on equity. The financing rate following the waiver or interest reduction period is not significantly different from the compensation rate from John Deere. During 2021, 2020, and 2019, the finance income earned from John Deere on retail notes containing waiver of finance charges or reduced rates was million, million, and million, respectively. A deposit is withheld by the Company on certain John Deere agriculture and turf equipment retail notes originating from dealers. Any subsequent retail note losses, subject to certain limitations by customer, are charged against the withheld deposits. At the end of each calendar quarter, the balance of each dealer s withholding account in excess of a specified percent (ranging from one -half to percent based on dealer qualifications) of the total balance outstanding on retail notes originating with that dealer is remitted to the dealer. Credit losses recovered from dealer deposits are presented in other income at the time the dealer deposits are charged. Prior to the adoption of ASU No. 2016-13, the benefit of credit losses recovered from dealer deposits was recognized in the provision for credit losses based on estimated recoveries. There is generally no withholding of dealer deposits on John Deere construction and forestry equipment retail notes. The Company generally requires that theft and physical damage insurance be carried on all goods leased or securing retail notes and wholesale receivables. In certain markets, the customer may, at the customer s own expense, have the Company or the seller of the goods purchase this insurance or obtain it from other sources. Revolving Charge Accounts Receivable Revolving charge account income is generated primarily by three revolving credit products: John Deere Financial Multi-Use Account, PowerPlan , and John Deere Financial Revolving Plan. John Deere Financial Multi-Use Account is primarily used by farmers and ranchers to finance parts and services from John Deere dealers, as well as crop inputs, such as seed, fertilizer, and crop protection from agribusiness merchants. Merchants, including agribusinesses and dealers, offer John Deere Financial Multi-Use Account as an alternative to carrying in-house accounts receivable and can initially sell existing balances to the Company under a recourse arrangement. John Deere Financial Multi-Use Account income includes a discount paid by merchants for transaction processing and support and finance charges paid by customers on their outstanding account balances. PowerPlan is primarily used by construction companies to finance parts and services. John

 million, million, and million, respectively. Revolving charge accounts receivable at October 31, 2021 and November 1, 2020 totaled million and million, and were net of unearned interest income of million and million for the same periods, respectively. Generally, account holders may pay the account balance in full at any time or make payments over a number of months according to a payment schedule. Wholesale Receivables The Company also provides wholesale financing to dealers of John Deere agriculture and turf equipment and construction and forestry equipment, primarily to finance inventories of equipment for those dealers. Wholesale finance income related to these notes is generally recognized monthly based on the daily balance of wholesale receivables outstanding and the applicable effective interest rate. Interest rates vary with a bank base rate, the type of equipment financed, and the balance outstanding. Substantially all wholesale receivables are secured by equipment financed or other collateral. The average actual life for wholesale receivables is less than . Wholesale receivables at October 31, 2021 and November 1, 2020 totaled million and million, respectively. The Company purchases certain wholesale trade receivables from John Deere, which are included within the wholesale receivable balances above. These trade receivables arise from John Deere s sales of goods to independent dealers. Under the terms of the sales to dealers, interest is primarily charged to dealers on outstanding balances, from the earlier of the date when goods are sold to retail customers by the dealer or the expiration of certain interest-free periods granted at the time of the sale to the dealer, until payment is received by the Company. Dealers cannot cancel purchases after John Deere recognizes a sale and are responsible for payment even if the equipment is not sold to retail customers. The interest-free periods are determined based on the type of equipment sold and the time of year of the sale. These periods range from one to for most equipment. Interest-free periods may not be extended. Interest charged may not be forgiven and the past due interest rates exceed market rates. The Company receives compensation from John Deere at approximate market interest rates for these interest-free periods. The Company computes the compensation from John Deere for interest-free periods based on the Company s estimated funding costs, administrative and operating expenses, credit losses, and required return on equity. During 2021, 2020, and 2019, the compensation earned from John Deere on wholesale receivables for waiver of finance charges or reduced rates was million, million, and million, respectively. Financing Leases The Company leases agriculture and turf equipment and construction and forestry equipment directly to retail customers. Leases classified as sales-type or direct financing leases are reported in financing leases on the consolidated balance sheet. See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for detailed disclosures related to financing leases. Concentration of Credit Risk Receivables have significant concentrations of credit risk in the agriculture and turf and construction and forestry markets as shown in the previous tables. On a geographic basis, there is not a disproportionate concentration of credit risk in any area. The Company generally secures its Receivables, other than certain revolving charge accounts, by retaining as collateral a security interest in the goods associated with those Receivables or with the use of other collateral.

 or more past the contractual payment due date. Non-performing Receivables represent receivables for which the Company has ceased accruing finance income. Generally, when retail notes , revolving charge accounts , and financing lease accounts are delinquent, accrual of finance income and lease revenue is suspended, and accrued finance income and lease revenue previously recognized is reversed. Generally, when a wholesale receivable becomes delinquent, the Company determines whether the accrual of finance income on interest-bearing wholesale receivables should be suspended and whether accrued finance income previously recognized should be reversed. During 2021, million of accrued finance income and lease revenue was reversed on non-performing Receivables. Finance income and lease revenue for non-performing Receivables is recognized on a cash basis. Accrual of finance income and lease revenue is generally resumed when the receivable becomes contractually current and collections are reasonably assured. Finance income and lease revenue of million was recognized from cash payments on non-performing Receivables during 2021. Receivable balances are written off to the allowance for credit losses when, in the judgment of management, they are considered uncollectible. Generally, when retail notes and financing lease accounts are delinquent, the collateral is repossessed or the account is designated for litigation, and the estimated uncollectible amount from the customer is written off to the allowance for credit losses. Revolving charge accounts are generally deemed to be uncollectible and written off to the allowance for credit losses when delinquency reaches . Generally, when a wholesale account becomes delinquent, the Company determines whether the collateral should be repossessed or the account designated for litigation, and the estimated uncollectible amount is written off to the allowance for credit losses. Due to the economic effects of COVID, the Company provided short-term payment relief to dealers and retail customers during 2020, and to a much lesser extent in 2021. The relief was provided in regional programs and on a case-by-case basis with customers that were generally current in their payment obligations. This relief generally included payment deferrals or reduced financing rates of or less. Receivables granted relief since the beginning of the pandemic that remained outstanding at October 31, 2021 represented approximately percent of the Receivables balance. The majority of Receivables granted short-term relief are beyond the deferral period and have either resumed making payments or are reported as delinquent based on the modified payment schedule. 30-59 days past due 60-89 days past due 90+ days past due Non-performing Construction and forestry Current 30-59 days past due 60-89 days past due 90+ days past due Non-performing Total Customer Receivables

Subsequent to the adoption of ASU No. 2016-13, the allowance decreased million during 2021, primarily due to a reduction in the allowance on construction and forestry retail notes and financing leases and a lower allowance on revolving charge accounts. The allowance on construction and forestry retail notes and financing leases decreased due to improving market conditions and better than expected performance of accounts granted payment relief due to the economic effects of COVID, while the allowance on revolving charge accounts was favorably impacted by

The short-term relief related to COVID previously discussed did not meet the definition of a troubled debt restructuring. In 2021, 2020 and 2019, there were significant troubled debt restructurings that subsequently defaulted and were written off. At October 1, 2021, the Company had commitments to provide additional financing to customers whose accounts were modified in troubled debt restructurings.

 million and million at October 31, 2021 and November 1, 2020, respectively. The liabilities (securitization borrowings and accrued interest) of these SPEs totaled million and million at October 31, 2021 and November 1, 2020, respectively. The credit holders of these SPEs do not have legal recourse to the Company s general credit. The Company has a revolving credit agreement to utilize bank conduit facilities to secure retail notes, described further in the following paragraphs. At October 31, 2021, the revolving credit agreement had a total capacity, or financing limit, of up to million of secured financings at any time. The agreement was renewed in November 2021 with an expiration in November 2022 and a capacity of million. As a result of the reduced capacity, the Company repurchased million of outstanding short-term securitization borrowings in November 2021, in addition to the normal monthly liquidations as a result of payments collected on the retail notes. Through the revolving credit agreement, the Company transfers retail notes into bank-sponsored, multi-seller, commercial paper conduits, which are SPEs that are not consolidated. The Company does not service a significant portion of the conduits receivables, and therefore, does not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the conduits economic performance. These conduits provide a funding source to the Company (as well as other transferors into the conduit) as they fund the retail notes through the issuance of commercial paper. The Company s carrying values and variable interest related to these conduits were restricted assets (retail notes securitized, allowance for credit losses, and other assets) of million and million at October 31, 2021 and November 1, 2020, respectively. The liabilities (securitization borrowings and accrued interest) related to these conduits were million and million at October 31, 2021 and November 1, 2020, respectively. Maximum exposure to loss The total assets of the unconsolidated conduits related to securitizations were approximately billion at October 31, 2021. In addition, through the revolving credit agreement, the Company transfers retail notes to banks, which may elect to fund the retail notes through the use of their own funding sources. These non-VIE banking operations are not consolidated since the Company does not have a controlling interest in them. The Company s carrying values and interests related to the securitizations with the unconsolidated non-VIEs were restricted assets (retail notes securitized, allowance for credit losses, and other assets) of million and million at October 31, 2021 and November 1, 2020, respectively.

Table of Contents 
 Accrued interest on borrowings Total liabilities related to restricted securitized assets The secured borrowings related to these restricted securitized retail notes are obligations that are payable as the retail notes are liquidated. Repayment of the secured borrowings depends primarily on cash flows generated by the restricted assets. Due to the Company s short-term credit rating, cash collections from these restricted assets are not required to be placed into a segregated collection account until immediately prior to the time payment is required to the secured creditors. At October 31, 2021, the maximum remaining term of all restricted securitized retail notes was approximately . to . Leases offered by the Company may . At the end of a lease, the lessee generally has the to the equipment for a fixed price or return it to the dealer. If the equipment is returned to the dealer, the dealer also has the option to purchase the equipment or return it to the Company for remarketing. The Company has lease and nonlease components. The nonlease components primarily relate to preventative maintenance and extended warranty agreements financed by the customer. The Company has also elected to report consideration related to net of the related tax expense. Property taxes on leased assets are recorded on a gross basis in lease revenues and administrative and operating expenses on the statement of consolidated income. Variable lease revenues primarily relate to separately invoiced property taxes on leased equipment in certain markets, late fees, and excess use and damage fees. Operating lease revenues Variable lease revenues Total lease revenues Variable lease revenues reported above includes excess use and damage fees of million and million for 2021 and 2020, respectively, which were reported in other income on the statement of consolidated income. Deposits withheld from John Deere dealers and related credit losses on leases are handled in a manner similar to the procedures for retail notes. As with retail notes, there are generally no deposits withheld from dealers on leases related to construction and forestry equipment. In addition, a lease payment discount program, allowing reduced payments over the term of the lease, is administered in a manner similar to finance waivers on retail notes (see Note 4).

The total residual value guarantees were million and million at October 31, 2021 and November 1, 2020, respectively. The increase in residual value guarantees is primarily due to guarantees provided by John Deere dealers, which generally provide a first-loss residual value guarantee on operating lease originations effective after January 2020. The residual value guarantees at October 31, 2021 and November 1, 2020 include million and million, respectively, of deposits withheld from John Deere dealers, which are available for potential losses on residual values. The Company discusses with lessees and dealers options to purchase the equipment or extend the lease prior to lease maturity. Equipment returned to the Company upon termination of leases is remarketed by the Company.

These amounts were million and million at October 31, 2021 and November 1, 2020, respectively. The delinquency status of operating leases granted relief due to COVID, as described below, is based on the modified payment schedule. Due to the economic effects of COVID, the Company provided short-term payment relief to lessees during 2020, and to a much lesser extent in 2021. The relief, which generally included payment deferrals of or less, was provided in regional programs and on a case-by-case basis with customers that were generally current in their payment obligations. The operating leases granted relief since the beginning of the pandemic that remained outstanding at October 31, 2021 represented approximately percent of the Company s operating lease portfolio. The majority of operating leases granted short-term relief are beyond the deferral period and have resumed making payments.

Capital Corporation has a variable interest in John Deere Canada Funding Inc. (JDCFI), a wholly-owned subsidiary of John Deere Financial Inc., which was created as a VIE to issue debt in public markets to fund the operations of affiliated companies in Canada. Capital Corporation has a variable interest in JDCFI because it provides guarantees for all debt issued by JDCFI, however it does not consolidate JDCFI because it does not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact JDCFI s economic performance. Capital Corporation has carrying value of assets or liabilities related to JDCFI. Its maximum exposure to loss is the amount of the debt issued by JDCFI and guaranteed by Capital Corporation, which was million at October 31, 2021.

The Company applies the same credit policies and approval process for these commitments to extend credit as it does for its Receivables. Collateral is not required for these commitments, but if credit is extended, collateral may be required upon funding. The amount of unused commitments to extend credit to John Deere dealers was billion at October 31, 2021.

Excluding the securitization programs, the remaining balance of restricted other assets was not material as of October 31, 2021. The Company is subject to various unresolved legal actions which arise in the normal course of its business, the most prevalent of which relate to retail credit matters. The Company believes the reasonably possible range of losses for these unresolved legal actions would not have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements.

The amounts the Company recognized on these affiliate party transactions were a loss of million during 2021 and gains of million and million during 2020 and 2019, respectively. Counterparty Risk and Collateral Derivative instruments are subject to significant concentrations of credit risk to the banking sector. The Company manages individual unrelated external counterparty exposure by setting limits that consider the credit rating of the unrelated external counterparty, the credit default swap spread of the counterparty, and other financial commitments and exposures between the Company and the unrelated external counterparty banks. All interest rate derivatives are transacted under International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) documentation. Each master agreement permits the net settlement of amounts owed in the event of default or termination. None of the Company s derivative agreements contain credit-risk-related contingent features. The Company s outstanding derivatives have been transacted with both unrelated external counterparties and with John Deere. For derivatives transacted with John Deere, the Company utilizes a centralized hedging structure in which John Deere enters into a derivative transaction with an unrelated external counterparty and simultaneously enters into a derivative transaction with the Company. Except for collateral provisions, the terms of the transaction between the Company and John Deere are identical to the terms of the transaction between John Deere and its unrelated external counterparty. The Company has ISDA agreements with John Deere that permit the net settlement of amounts owed between counterparties in the event of early termination. In addition, the Company has a loss sharing agreement with John Deere in which it has agreed to absorb any losses and expenses John Deere incurs if an unrelated external counterparty fails to meet its obligations on a derivative transaction that John Deere entered into to manage exposures of the Company. The loss sharing agreement did not increase the maximum amount of loss that the Company would incur, after considering collateral received and netting arrangements, as of October 31, 2021 and November 1, 2020.

Exhibit 4.8 DESCRIPTION OF THE 2.00 SENIOR NOTES DUE 2031 The following summary of our 2.00 Senior Notes due 2031 (the 2031 Notes is based on and qualified by the Senior Indenture, dated as of March 15, 1997, between John Deere Capital Corporation Capital Corporation and the Bank of New York Mellon (formerly known as The Bank of New York, successor Trustee to The Chase Manhattan Bank), as trustee (the Trustee ), as supplemented by a first supplemental senior indenture, dated as of April 21, 2011, a second supplemental senior indenture, dated as of April 17, 2014 and a third supplemental senior indenture, dated April 7, 2017 (such indenture, as so supplemented, the Indenture ). This summary is not complete and is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by reference to, the actual Indenture. For a complete description of the terms and provisions of the Company s notes, refer to the Indenture, which is filed as an exhibit to this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Throughout this exhibit, references to the Company, we, our, and us refer to John Deere Capital Corporation. We issued 600,000,000 total principal amount of the 2031 Notes on June 17, 2021. The 2031 Notes are a part of our Medium-Term Notes, Series H, Due from 9 Months to 30 Years from the Date of Issue issued under the Indenture and pursuant to a Prospectus, dated April 6, 2020 (the Prospectus ), and Prospectus Supplement, dated April 6, 2020 (together, the Prospectus Supplement ), and Pricing Supplement No. 11, dated June 14, 2021. The total initial public offering price of senior notes and subordinated notes that may be offered using the Prospectus Supplement was 25,000,000,000 or its equivalent in one or more foreign currencies, but this limit decreases by the sale of other securities that are described in the Prospectus including any sales of JDCC InterNotes Due Nine Months or More from Date of Issue. The Indenture governs our obligations under the 2031 Notes. The terms of the 2031 Notes include those stated in the Indenture and those made part of the Indenture by reference to the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended (the TIA ). The 2031 Notes are subject to all such terms. The 2031 Notes are traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol JDCC31. We have issued a significant amount of other debt securities under the Indenture that have neither been registered pursuant to Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 nor listed on the NYSE. You should refer to our description of the amount of debt outstanding as disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and in other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Indenture does not limit the amount of debt securities, including 2031 Notes, that the Company may issue under the Indenture. Defined terms used in this description but not in this summary have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture. General The 2031 Notes will mature on June 17, 2031 (the Maturity Date ). The 2031 Notes are senior securities of the Company and rank equally with all unsecured senior debt. The 2031 Notes are direct and unsecured obligations of the Company. The 2031 Notes are not subject to any sinking fund. The 2031 Notes were issued in a form of one or more registered Global Securities in minimum denominations of 1,000 with increments of 1,000 thereafter. 
 1 

 Interest and Interest Rates Interest on the 2031 Notes accrues at a rate of 2.00 per year accrued from June 17, 2021 and is payable semi-annually in arrears on June 17 and December 17 (each an Interest Payment Date), commencing on December 17, 2021 and ending on the Maturity Date. We pay interest to those persons who were holders of record of the 2031 Notes on the fifteenth calendar day (whether or not a business day) next preceding the applicable Interest Payment Date, as the case may be (each a Regular Record Date ). Interest is computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months. Interest on the 2031 Notes denominated in U.S. dollars will be paid by check mailed on an Interest Payment Date other than a Maturity Date to the persons entitled thereto to the addresses of such holders as they appear in the security register or, at our option, by wire transfer to a bank account maintained by the holder. The principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the 2031 Notes, together with interest accrued and unpaid thereon, due on the Maturity Date will be paid in immediately available funds upon surrender of such 2031 Notes at the corporate trust office of the Trustee in The City of New York, or, at our option, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account with a bank designated at least 15 calendar days prior to the Maturity Date by the applicable registered holder, provided the particular bank has appropriate facilities to receive these payments and the particular 2031 Note is presented and surrendered at the office or agency maintained by us for this purpose in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, in time for the Trustee to make these payments in accordance with its normal procedures. Payment If the Maturity Date or any repayment date or an Interest Payment Date for the 2031 Notes is not any day, other than a Saturday or Sunday, that is neither a legal holiday nor a day on which commercial banks are authorized or required by law, regulation or executive order to close in The City of New York (a Business Day ), the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the 2031 Notes will be paid on the next Business Day, and no interest will accrue from and after the Maturity Date or Interest Payment Date. Interest on the 2031 Notes will be paid to holders of record as of each Regular Record Date. Book-entry and other indirect holders should consult their banks or brokers for information on how they will receive payments on their debt securities. Book-Entry Debt Securities The 2031 Notes are issued in book-entry form only. This means that the Company did not and will not issue actual 2031 Notes or certificates to each holder. Instead, it issued issue a global security representing the 2031 Notes with similar terms and the Global Security is held by or on behalf of the Depositary Trust Company DTC or its nominee. In order to own a beneficial interest in a 2031 Note, you must be an institution that has an account with DTC or have an account with an institution, such as a brokerage firm, that has an account with DTC. Payments of principal of, premium, if any, and interest on 2031 Notes represented by a global security will be made in same-day funds to DTC in accordance with arrangements then in effect between the Trustee and DTC. Optional Redemption, Repayment and Repurchase The 2031 Notes are not redeemable prior to the stated maturity, and holders do not have the option to elect repayment by the Company prior to the date of the stated maturity. The Company may at any time purchase 2031 Notes at any price in the open market or otherwise. The Company may hold, resell or surrender for cancellation any 2031 Notes that it purchases. 
 2 

 Events of Default The term Event of Default in respect of the 2031 Notes means any of the following, among others: We do not pay the principal of, or any premium, if any, on the 2031 Notes on its due date. We do not pay interest on the 2031 Notes within 30 days of its due date. We remain in breach of a covenant in respect of the 2031 Notes for 60 days after we receive a written notice of default stating we are in breach. The notice must be sent by either the Trustee or holders of at least 25 of the principal amount of the 2031 Notes. We file for bankruptcy or certain other events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization occur. An Event of Default for a particular series of any of our debt securities does not necessarily constitute an Event of Default for any other series of debt securities issued under the same or any other indenture. The Trustee may withhold notice to the holders of debt securities of any default, except in the payment of principal, premium or interest, if it considers the withholding of notice to be in the best interests of the holders (Section 601). Remedies if an Event of Default Occurs. If an Event of Default has occurred and has not been cured, the Trustee or the holders of at least 25 in principal amount of the 2031 Notes may declare the entire principal amount of all the debt securities of the 2031 Notes to be due and immediately payable. This is called a declaration of acceleration of maturity. A declaration of acceleration of maturity may be canceled by the holders of a majority in principal amount of the 2031 Notes. (Section 502) Except in cases of default, where the Trustee has some special duties, the Trustee is not required to take any action under the applicable indenture at the request of any holders unless the holders offer the Trustee reasonable protection from expenses and liability (called an indemnity ). (Section 602 and Section 315 of the TIA) If reasonable indemnity is provided, the holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding 2031 Notes may direct the time, method and place of conducting any lawsuit or other formal legal action seeking any remedy available to the Trustee. The Trustee may refuse to follow those directions in certain circumstances. (Section 512) No delay or omission in exercising any right or remedy will be treated as a waiver of that right, remedy or Event of Default. (Section 511) Before you are allowed to bypass your Trustee and bring your own lawsuit or other formal legal action or take other steps to enforce your rights or protect your interests relating to the 2031 Notes, the following must occur: You must give your Trustee written notice that an Event of Default has occurred and remains uncured. The holders of at least 25 in principal amount of all outstanding 2031 Notes must make a written request that the trustee take action because of the default and must offer reasonable indemnity to the Trustee against the cost and other liabilities of taking that action. The Trustee must not have taken action for 60 days after receipt of the above notice and offer of indemnity. The holders of a majority in principal amount of the 2031 Notes must not have given the trustee a direction inconsistent with the above notice during that 60-day period. (Section 507) However, you are entitled at any time to bring a lawsuit for the payment of money due on your 2031 
 3 

 Notes on or after the due date. (Section 508) Holders of a majority in principal amount of the 2031 Notes may waive any past defaults other than the payment of principal, any premium or interest or in respect of a covenant that cannot be modified or amended without the consent of each holder. (Section 513) Book-entry and other indirect holders should consult their banks or brokers for information on how to give notice or direction to or make a request of the Trustee and how to declare or cancel an acceleration. Each year, we will furnish to each trustee a written statement of certain of our officers certifying that to their knowledge we are in compliance with the applicable indenture and the debt securities, or else specifying any default. (Section 1005) Merger or Consolidation Under the terms of the Indenture, we are generally permitted to consolidate or merge with another entity. We are also permitted to sell all or substantially all of our assets to another entity. (Section 801) However, we may not take any of these actions unless all the following conditions are met: Where we merge out of existence or sell our assets, the resulting entity must agree to be legally responsible for our obligations under the debt securities. (Section 801) The merger or sale of assets must not cause a default on the debt securities and we must not already be in default (unless the merger or sale would cure the default). For purposes of this no-default test, a default would include an Event of Default that has occurred and has not been cured, as described under Events of Default above. A default for this purpose would also include any event that would be an Event of Default if the requirements for giving us a notice of default or our default having to exist for a specific period of time were disregarded. (Section 801) Under the Indenture, no merger or sale of assets may be made if as a result any of our property or assets or any property or assets of one of our Subsidiaries would become subject to any mortgage, lien or other encumbrance unless either (i) the mortgage, lien or other encumbrance could be created pursuant to the limitation on liens covenant in the Indenture (see Limitation on Liens below) without equally and ratably securing the Indenture securities or (ii) the Indenture securities are secured equally and ratably with or prior to the debt secured by the mortgage, lien or other encumbrance. (Section 801 of the Indenture) We must deliver certain certificates and documents to the Trustee. (Section 801) We must satisfy any other requirements specified in the prospectus supplement or term sheet relating to the 2031 Notes. Modification or Waiver There are three types of changes we can make to the Indenture and the 2031 Notes issues thereunder. Changes Requiring Your Approval. First, there are changes that we cannot make to the 2031 Notes without your specific approval. (Section 902) Following is a list of those types of changes: change the stated maturity of the principal of or interest on the 2031 Notes; 
 4 

 reduce any amounts due on the 2031 Notes; reduce the amount of principal payable upon acceleration of the maturity of the 2031 Notes following a default; adversely affect any right of repayment at the holder s option; change the place or currency of payment on the 2031 Notes; impair your right to sue for payment; reduce the percentage of holders of 2031 Notes whose consent is needed to modify or amend the Indenture; reduce the percentage of holders of 2031 Notes whose consent is needed to waive compliance with certain provisions of the Indenture or to waive certain defaults; modify any other aspect of the provisions of the Indenture dealing with supplemental indentures (Section 902), modification and waiver of past defaults (Section 513), changes to the quorum or voting requirements (Section 1504) or the waiver of certain covenants (Section 1007); and change any obligation we have to pay additional amounts. Changes Not Requiring Approval. The second type of change does not require any vote by the holders of the 2031 Notes. This type is limited to clarifications and certain other changes that would not adversely affect holders of the 2031 Notes in any material respect. We also do not need any approval to make any change that affects only debt securities to be issued under the Indenture after the change takes effect. Changes Requiring Majority Approval. Any other change to the Indenture and the 2031 Notes would require the following approval: If the change affects only the 2031 Notes, it must be approved by the holders of a majority in principal amount of the 2031 Notes. If the change affects more than one series of debt securities issued under the Indenture, it must be approved by the holders of a majority in principal amount of all of the series affected by the change, with all affected series voting together as one class for this purpose. In each case, the required approval must be given by written consent. The holders of a majority in principal amount of all of the series of debt securities issued under an indenture, voting together as one class for this purpose, may waive our compliance with some of our covenants in that indenture. However, we cannot obtain a waiver of a payment default or of any of the matters covered by the bullet points included above under Changes Requiring Your Approval. Further Details Concerning Voting. Debt securities will not be considered outstanding, and therefore not eligible to vote, if we have deposited or set aside in trust money for their payment or redemption. Debt securities will also not be eligible to vote if they have been fully defeased as described below under Defeasance Full Defeasance . We will generally be entitled to set any date as a record date for the purpose of determining the holders of outstanding indenture securities that are entitled to vote or take other action under the indentures. If we set a record date for a vote or other action to be taken by holders of one or more series, that vote, or action may be taken only by persons who are holders of outstanding indenture securities of those series on the record date and must be taken within eleven months following the record date. 
 5 

 Defeasance Covenant Defeasance. Under current United States federal tax law, we can make the deposit described below and be released from some of the restrictive covenants in the Indenture. This is called covenant defeasance. In that event, you would lose the protection of those restrictive covenants but would gain the protection of having money and government securities set aside in trust to repay your debt securities. If the debt securities of the particular series are denominated in U.S. dollars, such as the 2031 Notes, we must deposit in trust for the benefit of all holders of such debt securities a combination of money and United States government or United States government agency notes or bonds that will generate enough cash to make interest, principal and any other payments on the debt securities on their various due dates. We must deliver to the trustee a legal opinion of our counsel confirming that, under current United States federal income tax law, we may make the above deposit without causing you to be taxed on the debt securities any differently than if we did not make the deposit and just repaid the debt securities ourselves at maturity. We must deliver to the trustee a legal opinion of our counsel stating that the above deposit does not require registration by us under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, and a legal opinion and officers certificate stating that all conditions precedent to covenant defeasance have been complied with. If we accomplish covenant defeasance, you can still look to us for repayment of the debt securities if there were a shortfall in the trust deposit or the trustee is prevented from making payment. In fact, if one of the remaining Events of Default occurred (such as our bankruptcy) and the debt securities, including the 2031 Notes, became immediately due and payable, there might be a shortfall. Depending on the event causing the default, you may not be able to obtain payment of the shortfall. Full Defeasance. If there is a change in United States federal tax law, as described below, we can legally release ourselves from all payment and other obligations on the debt securities of a particular series (called full defeasance if we put in place the following other arrangements for you to be repaid: If the debt securities of the particular series are denominated in U.S. dollars, such as the 2031 Notes, we must deposit in trust for the benefit of all holders of such debt securities a combination of money and United States government or United States government agency notes or bonds that will generate enough cash to make interest, principal and any other payments on the debt securities on their various due dates. We must deliver to the trustee a legal opinion confirming that there has been a change in current United States federal tax law or an Internal Revenue Service ruling that allows us to make the above deposit without causing you to be taxed on the debt securities any differently than if we did not make the deposit and just repaid the debt securities ourselves at maturity. (Section 1404) Under current United States federal tax law, the deposit and our legal release from the debt securities would be treated as though we paid you your share of the cash and notes or bonds at the time the cash and notes or bonds were deposited in trust in exchange for your debt securities and you would recognize gain or loss on the debt securities at the time of the deposit. We must deliver to the trustee a legal opinion of our counsel stating that the above deposit does not require registration by us under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, and a legal opinion and officers certificate stating that all conditions precedent to defeasance have been complied with. 
 6 

 If we ever did accomplish full defeasance, as described above, you would have to rely solely on the trust deposit for repayment of the debt securities, including the 2031 Notes. You could not look to us for repayment in the unlikely event of any shortfall. Conversely, the trust deposit would most likely be protected from claims of our lenders and other creditors if we ever became bankrupt or insolvent. Resignation of Trustee The Trustee may resign or be removed with respect to one or more series of Indenture securities provided that a successor trustee is appointed to act with respect to these series. (Section 608) In the event that two or more persons are acting as Trustee with respect to different series of securities under the Indenture, each of the trustees will be a trustee of a trust separate and apart from the trust administered by any other trustee. (Section 609) Limitation on Liens We covenant in the Indenture that neither we nor any of our Subsidiaries will pledge or subject to any lien any of our or their property or assets unless the securities under the Indenture are secured by this pledge or lien equally and ratably with other indebtedness thereby secured (the lien covenant ). There are excluded from this covenant liens created to secure obligations for the purchase price of physical property, liens of a Subsidiary securing indebtedness owed to us, liens existing on property acquired upon exercise of rights arising out of defaults on receivables acquired in the ordinary course of business, sales of receivables accounted for as secured indebtedness in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, certain liens not related to the borrowing of money and other liens not securing borrowed money aggregating less than 500,000. (Section 1006) Pursuant to the first, second and third supplemental indentures, senior securities that are part of a series created on or after the date of such supplemental indentures, such as the 2031 Notes, will be subject to further exclusions from the lien covenant with respect to cash collateral related to hedging transactions, collateral posted for extensions of credit by a unit of a central banking system through a discount window or similar facility or arrangement, and liens provided in connection with borrowing from loan and subsidy programs operated by (or on behalf of) a national development bank, country, government, government agency, supranational entity or similar agency or entity. The Trustee Under the Indenture The Bank of New York Mellon is a bank with which we and Deere Company maintain ordinary banking relationships and from which we and Deere Company have obtained credit facilities and lines of credit. The Bank of New York Mellon also serves as trustee under other indentures under which we or Deere Company are the obligor.

 1.4 Interest Rates; LIBOR Notification . The interest rate on Eurocurrency Loans denominated in Dollars and certain Foreign Currencies may be derived from an interest rate benchmark that is, or may in the future become, the subject of regulatory reform. Regulators have signaled the need to use alternative benchmark reference rates for some of these interest rate benchmarks and, as a result, such interest rate benchmarks may cease to comply with applicable laws and regulations, may be permanently discontinued, and/or the basis on which they are calculated may change. The London interbank offered rate is intended to represent the rate at which contributing banks may obtain short-term borrowings from each other in the London interbank market. In July 2017, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority announced that, after the end of 2021, it would no longer persuade or compel contributing 

30 
 banks to make rate submissions to the ICE Benchmark Administration (together with any successor to the ICE Benchmark Administrator, the IBA for purposes of the IBA setting the London interbank offered rate. As a result, it is possible that commencing in 2022, the London interbank offered rate may no longer be available or may no longer be deemed an appropriate reference rate upon which to determine the interest rate on Eurocurrency Loans. In light of this eventuality, public and private sector industry initiatives are currently underway to identify new or alternative reference rates to be used in place of the London interbank offered rate. Upon the occurrence of a Benchmark Transition Event, a Term SOFR Transition Event or an Early Opt-In Election with respect to any applicable Currency, subsection 2.11(b) and (c) provide a mechanism for determining an alternative rate of interest. The Administrative Agent will promptly notify the Borrower, pursuant to subsection 2.11(e), of any change to the reference rate upon which the interest rate on Eurocurrency Loans is based. However, the Administrative Agent does not warrant or accept any responsibility for, and shall not have any liability with respect to, the administration, submission or any other matter related to Daily Simple SONIA, the London interbank offered rate or other rates in the definition of Eurocurrency Rate or with respect to any alternative or successor rate thereto, or replacement rate thereof (including, without limitation, (i) any such alternative, successor or replacement rate implemented pursuant to subsection 2.11(b) or (c), whether upon the occurrence of a Benchmark Transition Event, a Term SOFR Transition Event or an Early Opt-in Election, and (ii) the implementation of any Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes pursuant to subsection 2.11(d)), including without limitation, whether the composition or characteristics of any such alternative, successor or replacement reference rate for any Currency will be similar to, or produce the same value or economic equivalence of, Adjusted Daily Simple SONIA, the Eurocurrency Rate or applicable Screen Rate for Loans denominated in such Currency or have the same volume or liquidity as did the London interbank offered rate (or the euro interbank offered rate, as applicable) prior to its discontinuance or unavailability. The Administrative Agent and its affiliates and/or other related entities may engage in transactions that affect the calculation of Adjusted Daily Simple SONIA, any alternative, successor or alternative rate (including any Benchmark Replacement) and/or any relevant adjustments thereto, in each case, in a manner adverse to the Borrowers. The Administrative Agent may select information sources or services in its reasonable discretion to ascertain SONIA or Daily Simple SONIA, any component thereof, or rates referenced in the definition thereof, in each case pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, and shall have no liability to the Borrowers, any Bank or any other person or entity for damages of any kind, including direct or indirect, special, punitive, incidental or consequential damages, costs, losses or expenses (whether in tort, contract or otherwise and whether at law or in equity), for any error or calculation of any such rate (or component thereof) provided by any such information source or service.

Any such notice of conversion to Eurocurrency Loans shall specify the length of the initial Interest Period or Interest Periods therefor. Upon receipt of any such notice the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Bank thereof.

Any change in the interest rate on a Committed Rate Loan resulting from a change in ABR shall become effective as of the opening of business on the day on which such change in ABR shall become effective. The Administrative Agent or the Foreign Currency Agent, as applicable, shall promptly notify the Borrowers and the Banks of the effective date and the amount of each such change. 
 (b) Each determination of an interest rate by the Administrative Agent or the Foreign Currency Agent, as applicable, pursuant to any provision of this Agreement shall be conclusive and binding on the Borrowers and the Banks in the absence of manifest error. 
 2.11 Inability to Determine Interest Rate . (a) With respect to any Eurocurrency Loan denominated in any Currency or SONIA Loan denominated in Pounds Sterling that is then outstanding, or that has been requested to be borrowed, in the event that the Administrative Agent or the Foreign Currency Agent, as applicable, shall have determined (which determination shall be conclusive and binding upon the Borrowers) that (i) by reason of circumstances affecting the interbank market for the applicable Currency generally, (A) adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the Screen Rate for such Currency for any requested Interest Period with respect to Committed Rate Loans that a Borrower has requested be made as, continued as or converted into Eurocurrency Loans or (B) adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining Adjusted Daily Simple SONIA or Daily Simple SONIA for SONIA Loans; provided that this clause (i) shall not apply to a Loan denominated in any Currency to the extent that a Benchmark Transition Event in respect of such Currency shall have occurred at such time or (ii) that deposits in the applicable Currency are not generally available, or cannot be obtained by the Banks, in the applicable market (any Foreign Currency affected by the circumstances described in clause (i) or (ii) is referred to as an Affected Foreign Currency ), the Administrative Agent or the Foreign Currency Agent, as applicable, shall promptly give notice of such determination to such Borrower and the Banks , which with respect to Eurocurrency Loans, shall be prior to the first day of the requested Interest Period for such Eurocurrency Loans. If such notice is given, such Borrower may (A) in accordance with the provisions of subsection 2.1 or 2.9, as the case may be (including any requirements for notification), request that the affected Loans denominated in Dollars be made as, continued as or converted into, as the case may be, ABR Loans, (B) request that any outstanding Foreign Currency Eurocurrency Loans in an Affected Foreign Currency be converted, on the last day of the then- 

40 
 current Interest Period, to Dollar Loans at the applicable Exchange Rate or , (C) request that any outstanding SONIA Loan bear interest at the Central Bank Rate for Pounds Sterling plus the CBR Spread; provided that, if the Administrative Agent, determines (which determination shall be conclusive and binding absent manifest error) that the Central Bank Rate for Pounds Sterling cannot be determined, any outstanding affected SONIA Loans, at the applicable Borrower s election, shall either (A) be converted into ABR Loans denominated in Dollars at the applicable exchange rate immediately or (B) be prepaid in full immediately or (D) in the case of (A) Loans (other than SONIA Loans) requested to be made on the first day of such Interest Period or (B) SONIA Loans requested to be made , withdraw the notice given under subsection 2.1 or 2.9, as the case may be, by giving telephonic notice to the Administrative Agent or the Foreign Currency Agent, as applicable, no later than 10:00 A.M. (Local Time) one Business Day prior to the applicable Borrowing Date, confirmed in writing no later than one Business Day after such telephonic notice is given; provided that if the Administrative Agent or the Foreign Currency Agent, as applicable, does not receive any notice permitted from the relevant Borrower hereunder, such Borrower shall be deemed to have requested that the affected Loans be made as, continued as or converted into, as the case may be, ABR Loans or, in the case of Foreign Currency Loans, shall be deemed to have requested that the affected Loans be made as, continued as or converted into, as the case may be, Dollar Loans which are (1) ABR Loans (in the case of clause (i) above) or (2) Eurocurrency Loans (in the case of clause (ii) above). Until the notice given pursuant to the first sentence of this paragraph has been withdrawn by the Administrative Agent or the Foreign Currency Agent, as applicable, no further Eurocurrency Loans denominated in Dollars (in the case of clause (i) above) or Eurocurrency Loans or SONIA Loans, in each case in an Affected Foreign Currency , shall be made or , with respect to such Eurocurrency Loans, continued as such, nor shall the Borrower have the right to convert ABR Loans to Eurocurrency Loans. (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, if a Benchmark Transition Event or an Early Opt-in Election, as applicable, and its related Benchmark Replacement Date have occurred prior to the Reference Time in respect of any setting of the then-current Benchmark with respect to a Loan denominated in any Currency, then (x) if a Benchmark Replacement for a Loan denominated in such Currency is determined in accordance with clause (1) or (2) of the definition of Benchmark Replacement for such Benchmark Replacement Date, such Benchmark Replacement will replace such Benchmark for a Loan denominated in such Currency for all purposes hereunder and under any Loan Document in respect of such Benchmark setting and subsequent Benchmark settings without any amendment to, or further action or consent of any other party to, this Agreement or any other Loan Document and (y) if a Benchmark Replacement for a Loan denominated in such Currency is determined in accordance with clause (3) of the definition of Benchmark Replacement for such Benchmark Replacement Date such Benchmark Replacement will replace such Benchmark for all purposes hereunder and under any Loan Document in respect of any Benchmark setting at or after 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the fifth (5th) Business Day after the date notice of such Benchmark Replacement is provided to the Banks without any amendment to, or further action or consent of any other party to, this Agreement or any other Loan Document so long as the Administrative Agent has not received, by such time, written notice of objection to such Benchmark Replacement from Banks comprising the Majority Banks. (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document and subject to the proviso below in this paragraph, solely with respect to a Loan denominated in Dollars, if a Term SOFR Transition Event and its related Benchmark Replacement Date have occurred prior to the Reference Time in respect of any setting of the then-current Benchmark, then the applicable Benchmark Replacement will replace the then-current Benchmark for all purposes hereunder or under any Loan Document in respect of such Benchmark setting and subsequent Benchmark settings, without any amendment to, or further action or consent of any other party to, this Agreement or any other Loan 

41 
 Document; provided that, this clause (c) shall not be effective unless the Administrative Agent has delivered to the Banks and the Company a Term SOFR Notice. (d) In connection with the implementation of a Benchmark Replacement, the Administrative Agent, in consultation with the Company, will have the right to make Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes from time to time and, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, any amendments implementing such Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes will become effective without any further action or consent of any other party to this Agreement or any other Loan Document. (e) The Administrative Agent will promptly notify the Company and the Banks of (i) any occurrence of a Benchmark Transition Event, a Term SOFR Transition Event or an Early Opt-in Election, as applicable, and its related Benchmark Replacement Date, (ii) the implementation of any Benchmark Replacement, (iii) the effectiveness of any Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes, (iv) the removal or reinstatement of any tenor of a Benchmark pursuant to clause (f) below and (v) the commencement or conclusion of any Benchmark Unavailability Period. Any determination, decision or election that may be made by the Administrative Agent or, if applicable, any Bank (or group of Banks) pursuant to this subsection 2.11, including any determination with respect to a tenor, rate or adjustment or of the occurrence or non-occurrence of an event, circumstance or date and any decision to take or refrain from taking any action or any selection, will be conclusive and binding absent manifest error and may be made in its or their sole discretion and without consent from any other party hereto or any other Loan Document, except, in each case, as expressly required pursuant to this subsection 2.11. (f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, at any time (including in connection with the implementation of a Benchmark Replacement), (i) if the then-current Benchmark is a term rate (including Term SOFR or Eurocurrency Rate) and either (A) any tenor for such Benchmark is not displayed on a screen or other information service that publishes such rate from time to time as selected by the Administrative Agent in its reasonable discretion or (B) the regulatory supervisor for the administrator of such Benchmark has provided a public statement or publication of information announcing that any tenor for such Benchmark is or will be no longer representative, then the Administrative Agent may modify the definition of Interest Period for any Benchmark settings at or after such time to remove such unavailable or non-representative tenor and (ii) if a tenor that was removed pursuant to clause (i) above either (A) is subsequently displayed on a screen or information service for a Benchmark (including a Benchmark Replacement) or (B) is not, or is no longer, subject to an announcement that it is or will no longer be representative for a Benchmark (including a Benchmark Replacement), then the Administrative Agent shall modify the definition of Interest Period for all Benchmark settings at or after such time to reinstate such previously removed tenor. (g) Upon the Company s receipt of notice of the commencement of a Benchmark Unavailability Period with respect to the Relevant Rate applicable to any Eurocurrency Loan , and or SONIA Loan, as applicable, and, with respect to such Eurocurrency Loans, during the continuance thereof (in each case below, to the extent such Benchmark Unavailability Period is in respect of the Relevant Rate applicable to such Eurocurrency Loan or such SONIA Loan, as applicable ), (i) a Borrower may revoke any request for a Eurocurrency Loan or SONIA Loan to be made during such Benchmark Unavailability Period, and, failing that, the applicable Borrower will be deemed to have converted such request for a Eurocurrency Loan denominated in Dollars into a request for an ABR Loan and (ii) any request for a Eurocurrency Loan denominated in a Foreign Currency or a SONIA Loan shall be ineffective. During any Benchmark Unavailability Period or at any time that a tenor for the then-current Benchmark is not an Available Tenor, the component of ABR based upon the then-current Benchmark or such tenor for such Benchmark, as applicable, will not be used in any determination of ABR. Furthermore, if any Eurocurrency Loan in any Currency or SONIA Loan is outstanding on the date of the 

42 
 Company s receipt of notice of the commencement of a Benchmark Unavailability Period with respect to the Relevant Rate applicable to such Eurocurrency Loan or SONIA Loan, as applicable , then (i) if such Eurocurrency Loan is denominated in Dollars, on the last day of the Interest Period applicable to such Loan (or the next succeeding Business Day if such day is not a Business Day), such Loan shall be converted by the Administrative Agent to, and shall constitute, an ABR Loan denominated in Dollars on such day or , (ii) if such Eurocurrency Loan is denominated in any Foreign Currency, such Loan shall, on the last day of the Interest Period applicable to such Loan (or the next succeeding Business Day if such day is not a Business Day), at the applicable Borrower s election prior to such day: (A) be prepaid by the applicable Borrower on such day or (B) be converted by the Administrative Agent to, and shall constitute, an ABR Loan denominated in Dollars (in an amount equal to the Dollar Equivalent of the amount of such Eurocurrency Loan on such day (it being understood and agreed that if the applicable Borrower does not so prepay such Loan on such day by 12:00 noon, Local Time, the Administrative Agent is authorized to effect such conversion of such Eurocurrency Loan into an ABR Loan denominated in Dollars)); provided that, in the case of this subclause (B), upon any subsequent implementation of a Benchmark Replacement in respect of such Foreign Currency pursuant to this subsection 2.11, such ABR Loan denominated in Dollars shall then be converted by the Administrative Agent to, and shall constitute, a Eurocurrency Loan denominated in the original Foreign Currency applicable to such Loan (in an amount equal to the Foreign Currency Equivalent of the amount of such ABR Loan) on the day of, and after giving effect to, such implementation . or (iii) such SONIA Loan shall bear interest at the Central Bank Rate for Pounds Sterling plus the CBR Spread; provided that, if the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive and binding absent manifest error) that the Central Bank Rate for Pounds Sterling cannot be determined, any outstanding affected SONIA Loans, at the Company s election, shall either (A) be converted into ABR Loans denominated in Dollars (in an amount equal to the Dollar Equivalent of Pounds Sterling) immediately or (B) be prepaid in full immediately. 2.12 Pro Rata Treatment and Payments . (a) All payments (including prepayments) to be made by the Borrowers on account of principal, Reimbursement Obligations, interest and fees shall be made without defense, set-off or counterclaim and shall be made, in the case of fees and principal of, and interest on, Loans (other than Negotiated Rate Loans) and Reimbursement Obligations at the Administrative Agent s office specified in subsection 10.2, in each case in the relevant Currency in which the Loan was made (and in Dollars in the case of Reimbursement Obligations) and in immediately available funds not later than 11:00 A.M. (Local Time) on the date due. The Administrative Agent shall distribute such payments to the Banks entitled thereto on the day of receipt in like funds as received, provided that the Administrative Agent shall have received such payments not later than 11:00 A.M. (Local Time). If the Administrative Agent shall distribute such payments to the Banks entitled thereto on a date after the date on which such payments were received prior to 11:00 A.M. (Local Time), the Administrative Agent shall pay to each such Bank on demand an amount equal to the product of (i) the daily average applicable Overnight Rate, times (ii) the amount of such Bank s share of such payment, times (iii) a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days that elapse from and including such date of receipt of payment by the Administrative Agent to but excluding the date on which such Bank s share of such payment shall have become immediately available to such Bank and the denominator of which is 360. All payments (including prepayments) to be made by the Borrowers on account of principal, interest and fees relating to Negotiated Rate Loans shall be made to the Bank with respect thereto on such terms, at such address and at such time as shall be mutually agreed upon between the relevant Borrower and the relevant Bank in lawful money of the United States of America on the date due. 
 (b) (i) Each borrowing by a Borrower of Committed Rate Loans and each payment of principal in respect of Committed Rate Loans (subject to the provisions of subsection 2.20(e)) shall be made in accordance with the following requirements: 

43 
 (A) All borrowings of Committed Rate Loans and all principal payments in respect of such Loans, shall be made pro rata according to the respective Commitments of the Banks. 
 (B) As provided in clause (b)(ii) below, if any principal payment is made in respect of any Loans (other than Negotiated Rate Loans) on any day on which principal amounts are due and owing in respect of any Loans (other than Negotiated Rate Loans), such principal payment shall be applied to the Banks pro rata according to the respective amounts of principal due and owing to the Banks under this Agreement. 
 (ii) Except as provided in subsections 2.13, 2.16 and 2.17, each reduction of the Commitments shall be made pro rata among the Banks according to their respective Commitment Percentages. Each payment by the Borrowers under this Agreement or of any Loan (other than Negotiated Rate Loans) shall be applied, first , to any fees then due and owing pursuant to subsections 2.4 and 2.26, second , to interest then due and owing in respect of the Loans (other than Negotiated Rate Loans) and Reimbursement Obligations and third , to principal then due and owing hereunder (other than principal due and owing under Negotiated Rate Loans) under the Loans (other than Negotiated Rate Loans) and Reimbursement Obligations. Each payment made by the Company or the Capital Corporation under this Agreement relating to a Negotiated Rate Loan to the Bank with respect thereto shall be applied, first , to interest then due and owing in respect of such Negotiated Rate Loan and second , to principal then due and owing hereunder with respect to such Negotiated Rate Loan and under such Negotiated Rate Loan. Each payment (other than voluntary prepayments made when no principal payments are due and owing hereunder) by a Borrower on account of principal of and interest on the Loans (other than Negotiated Rate Loans) and Reimbursement Obligations shall be made for the account of each Bank pro rata according to the respective amounts of principal, Reimbursement Obligations and interest due and owing to such Bank under this Agreement. Subject to the requirements of clause (i) of this paragraph (b), each payment by a Borrower on account of principal of the Loans (other than Negotiated Rate Loans) and Reimbursement Obligations shall be applied, first , to such of its Committed Rate Loan borrowings and Reimbursement Obligations as such Borrower may designate and, second , after all Committed Rate Loans and Reimbursement Obligations shall have been paid in full, to all of its Absolute Rate Bid Loans or Index Rate Bid Loans made on the same Borrowing Date with the same Interest Period as such Borrower may designate, pro rata according to the respective amounts outstanding; provided , however , that prepayments made pursuant to subsection 2.13(a), (b) or (c), 2.16(c) or 2.17(b) shall be applied in accordance with such subsection. 
 (c) If any payment hereunder (other than payments on the Eurocurrency Loans and Index Rate Bid Loans) becomes due and payable on a day other than a Business Day, such payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day. If any payment on a Eurocurrency Loan or Index Rate Bid Loan becomes due and payable on a day other than a Working Day, the maturity thereof shall be extended to the next succeeding Working Day unless the result of such extension would be to extend such payment into another calendar month in which event such payment shall be made on the immediately preceding Working Day. With respect to any extension of the payment of principal pursuant to this subsection 2.12(c), interest thereon shall be payable at the then applicable rate during such extension. 

44 
 (d) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have been notified in writing by any Bank prior to the date of the Committed Rate Loan, Committed Rate Loans, Bid Loan or Bid Loans to be made by such Bank (which notice shall be effective upon receipt) that such Bank will not make its pro rata share of the amount of the requested borrowing on such date available to the Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Bank has made such amount available to it on such date and the Administrative Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the relevant Borrower a corresponding amount. If a Bank shall make such amount available to the Administrative Agent on a date after such Borrowing Date, such Bank shall pay to the Administrative Agent on demand an amount equal to the product of (i) the daily average applicable Overnight Rate, times (ii) the amount of such Bank s pro rata share of such borrowing, times (iii) a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days that elapse from and including such Borrowing Date to but excluding the date on which such Bank s pro rata share of such borrowing shall have become immediately available to the Administrative Agent and the denominator of which is 360. A certificate of the Administrative Agent submitted to any Bank with respect to any amounts owing under this subsection 2.12(d) shall be conclusive, absent manifest error. If such Bank s pro rata share is not in fact made available to the Administrative Agent by such Bank within three Business Days of such Borrowing Date, the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to recover such amount, on demand, from the relevant Borrower with interest thereon at the rate equal to the product of (i) during the period from and including such Borrowing Date to the Business Day next following the date of such demand, the daily average applicable Overnight Rate, times a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days that elapse from and including such Borrowing Date to but excluding the Business Day next following the date of such demand and the denominator of which is 360 and (ii) thereafter, the interest rate or rates applicable to the Loan or Loans funded by the Administrative Agent on behalf of such Bank on such Borrowing Date, times a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days which elapse from and including the Business Day next following the date of such demand to but excluding the date such amount is recovered by the Administrative Agent from such Borrower and the denominator of which is 360. In the event any Bank s pro rata share of a borrowing is not made available to the Administrative Agent in accordance with this paragraph within three Business Days of the applicable Borrowing Date (i) such Bank shall, during the period from such Borrowing Date to the date such Bank makes its pro rata share of the applicable borrowing available, not accrue and shall not be entitled to receive any commitment fee under subsection 2.4 and (ii) each Borrower may exercise or pursue any other rights, remedies, powers and privileges against such Bank as are provided by law or by contract. 
 2.13 Requirements of Law . (a) If any Bank shall determine that by reason of (i) the introduction after the date hereof of any applicable law, regulation or guideline or any change after the date hereof in any applicable law, regulation or guideline (including the phasing-in of a provision of any applicable law, regulation or guideline) or in the interpretation thereof by any governmental or other regulatory authority charged with the administration thereof or any court of competent jurisdiction and/or (ii) compliance by such Bank with any requirement adopted after the date hereof or directive adopted after the date hereof from any central bank or other fiscal, monetary or other regulatory authority (whether or not having the force of law), there shall be any increase in the cost of such Bank of maintaining or giving effect to its obligations with respect to Committed Rate Loans or Letters of Credit under this Agreement or maintaining its Commitment with respect to Committed Rate Loans or Letters of Credit or making or maintaining any Eurocurrency Loans or SONIA Loans or any reduction in any amount receivable by such Bank in respect of Eurocurrency Loans or SONIA Loans under this Agreement, notwithstanding the reasonable efforts (such reasonable efforts not to result in the incurrence of additional costs or expenses) of such Bank to mitigate such increase or reduction (excluding for purposes of this subsection 2.13 any such increased costs resulting from (x) Indemnified Taxes (as to which subsection 2.17 shall govern), (y) changes in the basis of taxation of overall net income or overall gross income by the United States or by the foreign jurisdiction or state under the laws of which such 

45 
 Bank is organized or has its applicable lending office or any political subdivision thereof and (z) FATCA), then the relevant Borrower shall from time to time on receipt (whenever occurring) of a certificate from such Bank (which shall be executed by an officer thereof and a copy of which shall be delivered to the Administrative Agent) pay to such Bank such amounts as are stated therein to be required to indemnify such Bank against such increased costs or reduction; provided , however, that if such Borrower becomes obligated to pay any Bank any additional amount pursuant to this subsection 2.13(a), such Borrower shall have the right, so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is then continuing, upon giving notice to the Administrative Agent and such Bank in accordance with subsection 2.6, to prepay in full the Loans of such Bank, together with accrued interest thereon, any amounts payable to such Bank pursuant to subsections 2.13, 2.14, 2.15 and 2.17 and any accrued and unpaid commitment fee, Letter of Credit Fee, Reimbursement Obligations in respect of Letters of Credit or other amount payable to such Bank hereunder and/or, upon giving not less than three Business Days notice to any such Bank and the Administrative Agent, to cancel the whole or part of the Commitment of any such Bank (and upon such cancellation, such Bank s participation in any then outstanding undrawn Letters of Credit shall terminate) (it being understood that any partial cancellation of the Commitment shall result in a corresponding reduction of such Bank s participating interest in respect of Letters of Credit); provided , further, that such Borrower shall not be obligated to pay any Bank any additional amount pursuant to this subsection 2.13(a) (A) which constitutes a present or future income, stamp or other tax, levy, impost, duty, charge, fee, deduction or withholding referred to in subsection 2.17(a) or (B) as a result of any law, rule, guideline, regulation, request or directive regarding capital adequacy or liquidity referred to in subsection 2.13(b).

The Capital Corporation further agrees that its agreement hereunder constitutes a promise of payment when due and not of collection, and waives any right to require that any resort be had by any Bank to any balance of any deposit account or credit on the books of any Bank in favor of JD Luxembourg or any other Person. The obligations of the Capital Corporation hereunder shall not be subject to any reduction, limitation, impairment or termination for any reason, and shall not be subject to any defense or setoff, counterclaim, recoupment or termination whatsoever, by reason of the invalidity, illegality or 

63 
 unenforceability of the Luxembourg Obligations or otherwise. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the obligations of the Capital Corporation hereunder shall not be discharged or impaired or otherwise affected by the failure of the Administrative Agent or any Bank to assert any claim or demand or to enforce any remedy under this Agreement or any other agreement, by any waiver or modification in respect of any thereof, by any default, failure or delay, willful or otherwise, in the performance of the Luxembourg Obligations, or by any other act or omission which may or might in any manner or to any extent vary the risk of the Capital Corporation or otherwise operate as a discharge of the Capital Corporation as a matter of law or equity. The Capital Corporation further agrees that its obligations hereunder shall continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time payment, or any part thereof, of principal of or interest on any Luxembourg Obligation is rescinded or must otherwise be restored by the Administrative Agent or any Bank upon the bankruptcy or reorganization of JD Luxembourg or otherwise. In furtherance of the foregoing and not in limitation of any other right which the Administrative Agent or any Bank may have at law or in equity against the Capital Corporation by virtue hereof, upon the failure of JD Luxembourg to pay any Luxembourg Obligation when and as the same shall become due, whether at maturity, by acceleration, after notice of prepayment or otherwise, the Capital Corporation hereby promises to and will, upon receipt of written demand by the Administrative Agent, forthwith pay, or cause to be paid, in cash the amount of such unpaid Luxembourg Obligation. In the event that, by reason of the bankruptcy of JD Luxembourg, (i) acceleration of Loans made to JD Luxembourg is prevented and (ii) the Capital Corporation shall not have prepaid the outstanding Loans and other amounts due hereunder owed by JD Luxembourg, the Capital Corporation will forthwith purchase such Loans at a price equal to the principal amount thereof plus accrued interest thereon and any other amounts due hereunder with respect thereto. The Capital Corporation further agrees that if payment in respect of any Luxembourg Obligation shall be due in a currency other than Dollars and/or at a place of payment other than New York and if, by reason of any change in law, disruption of currency or foreign exchange markets, war or civil disturbance or similar event, payment of such Luxembourg Obligation in such currency or such place of payment shall be impossible or, in the reasonable judgment of any applicable Bank, not consistent with the protection of its rights or interests, then, at the election of any applicable Bank, the Capital Corporation shall make payment of such Luxembourg Obligation in Dollars (based upon the applicable Exchange Rate in effect on the date of payment) and/or in New York. Notwithstanding any payment made by the Capital Corporation hereunder or any set-off or application of funds of the Capital Corporation by the Administrative Agent or any Bank, the Capital Corporation shall not be entitled to be subrogated to any of the rights of the Administrative Agent or any Bank against JD Luxembourg or any guarantee or right of offset held by the Administrative Agent or any Bank for the payment of the Luxembourg Obligations, until all amounts owing to the Administrative Agent and the Banks by JD Luxembourg on account of the Luxembourg Obligations are paid in full in cash. If any amount shall be paid to the Capital Corporation on account of such subrogation rights at any time when all of the Luxembourg Obligations shall not have been paid in full in cash, such amount shall be held by the Capital Corporation in trust for the Administrative Agent and the Banks, segregated from its other funds, and shall, forthwith upon receipt by it, be turned over to the Administrative Agent in the exact form received by it (duly indorsed by it to the Administrative Agent, if required), to be applied against the Luxembourg Obligations, whether matured or unmatured, in such order as the Administrative Agent may determine.

EXHIBIT G [FORM OF OPINION OF GENERAL COUNSEL TO THE COMPANY] [Closing Date] To each of the Banks parties to the Credit Agreement referred to below and to JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Administrative Agent Deere Company and John Deere Capital Corporation 2025 Credit Agreement Ladies and Gentlemen: This opinion is furnished to you pursuant to subsection 4.1(c) of the 2,500,000,000 2025 Credit Agreement dated as of March 29, 2021 (the Credit Agreement among Deere Company (the Company ), John Deere Capital Corporation (the Capital Corporation and, together with the Company, the U.S. Borrowers and John Deere Bank S.A., the Banks parties thereto, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Administrative Agent, Citibank, N.A., as Documentation Agent, and Bank of America, N.A., as Syndication Agent. Terms defined in the Credit Agreement and not otherwise defined in this opinion are used herein as defined in the Credit Agreement. I am General Counsel of the Company and have also acted as counsel for the Capital Corporation in this matter. I am familiar with the corporate history and organization of each U.S. Borrower and of its Subsidiaries and the proceedings relating to the authorization, execution and delivery by each U.S. Borrower of the Credit Agreement. In that connection I have examined or caused to have examined: 1. The Credit Agreement; 2. The documents furnished by each of the U.S. Borrowers pursuant to Section 4 of the Credit Agreement; 3. The Certificates of Incorporation of the U.S. Borrowers and all amendments thereto (the Charters 4. The bylaws of the U.S. Borrowers and all amendments thereto (the Bylaws and 5. Certificates of the Secretary of State of Delaware, each dated a recent date, attesting to the continued corporate existence and good standing of the U.S. Borrowers in that State. In addition, I have reviewed or caused to have reviewed such of the corporate proceedings of the U.S. Borrowers, and have examined or caused to have examined such documents, corporate records, and other instruments relating to the organization of the U.S. Borrowers and their respective Subsidiaries and such other agreements and instruments to which the U.S. Borrowers and their respective Subsidiaries are parties, as I consider necessary as a basis for the opinions hereinafter 

G- 2 
 expressed. I have assumed the due execution and delivery, pursuant to due authorization, of the Credit Agreement by the Banks, the Administrative Agent, the Syndication Agent, and the Documentation Agent, and the authenticity of all documents submitted to me as originals and the conformity to the original documents of all documents submitted to me as certified, conformed or photostatic or electronic copies. I am qualified to practice law in the State of Illinois and the State of Iowa and do not purport to be an expert on, and do not express any opinion herein concerning, any laws other than the laws of the State of Illinois and the State of Iowa, the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware and the Federal laws of the United States. Based upon the foregoing and upon such investigation as I have deemed necessary, I am of the following opinion: 1. Each of the Company and the Capital Corporation is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware and has the corporate power and authority to carry on its business as now being conducted and to own its properties. 2. The execution, delivery and performance by each U.S. Borrower of the Credit Agreement are within such U.S. Borrower s corporate powers, have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action, and do not (i) contravene, or constitute a default under the Charter or the Bylaws of such U.S. Borrower, any judgment, law, rule or regulation applicable to such U.S. Borrower, or any Contractual Obligation by which such U.S. Borrower is bound or (ii) result in the creation of any lien, charge or encumbrance upon any of its property or assets. The Credit Agreement has been duly executed and delivered on behalf of each U.S. Borrower. 3. No authorization, approval, or other action by, and no notice to or filing with, any governmental authority or regulatory body is required for the due execution, delivery and performance by each U.S. Borrower of the Credit Agreement. 4. There is no pending or, to the best of my knowledge, threatened action or proceeding against either U.S. Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries before any court, governmental agency or arbitrator which is likely to have a materially adverse effect upon the financial condition or operations of such U.S. Borrower and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole. A copy of this opinion letter may be delivered by any of you to any person that becomes a Bank in accordance with the provisions of the Credit Agreement. Any such person may rely on the opinions expressed above as if this opinion letter were addressed and delivered to such person on the date hereof. This opinion letter is rendered to you in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Credit Agreement. This opinion letter may not be relied upon by you or any person entitled to rely on this opinion pursuant to the preceding paragraph for any other purpose without my prior written consent. This opinion letter speaks only as of the date hereof. I expressly disclaim any responsibility to advise you of any development or circumstance of any kind, including any change of law or fact, that may occur after the date of this opinion letter even though such development or circumstance

EXHIBIT H [FORM OF ENFORCEABILITY OPINION OF SPECIAL NEW YORK COUNSEL TO THE BORROWERS] [Closing Date] To the Agent and each of the Banks under the Credit Agreement (referred to below) on the date hereof: Re: 2,500,000,000 2025 Credit Agreement dated as of March 29, 2021, by and among Deere Company, a Delaware corporation (the Company ), John Deere Capital Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the Capital Corporation ), John Deere Bank S.A., a public limited company organized under the laws of Luxembourg JD Luxembourg , and together with the Company and the Capital Corporation, the Borrowers ), the financial institutions from time to time party thereto as lenders (the Lenders ), JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as the Administrative Agent for the Banks (in such capacity, the Agent and the other parties thereto (such credit agreement herein referred to as the Credit Agreement Ladies and Gentlemen: We are issuing this opinion letter in our capacity as counsel to and at the request of the Borrowers in respect of the Credit Agreement. The opinions expressed herein are being provided pursuant to Section 4.1(c) of the Credit Agreement. Capitalized terms used but not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings given to such terms in the Credit Agreement (with references herein to the Credit Agreement and each document defined therein meaning the Credit Agreement and each such document as executed and delivered on the date hereof). The Banks and the Agent are sometimes referred to in this opinion letter as you . In connection with the preparation of this letter, we have, among other things, reviewed executed counterparts of the Credit Agreement. Subject to the assumptions, qualifications, exclusions and other limitations which are identified in this opinion letter, we advise you, and with respect to each legal issue addressed in this opinion letter, it is our opinion, that (a) the Credit Agreement is a valid and binding obligation of each Borrower that is a party thereto and is enforceable against such Borrower in accordance with its terms and (b) the guarantee by the Capital Corporation pursuant to Section 2.27 of the Credit Agreement is a valid and binding obligation of the Capital Corporation and is enforceable against the Capital Corporation in accordance with its terms. With your consent, we have assumed for purposes of this letter and the opinions herein: (a) that each document we have reviewed for purposes of this letter is accurate and complete, each such document that is an original is authentic, each such document that is a copy conforms to an authentic original, and all signatures on each such document are genuine, and that all natural persons who have signed any document have the legal capacity to do so; 

I- 2 
 (b) that the Credit Agreement and every other agreement we have examined for purposes of this letter has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the parties thereto and constitutes a valid and binding obligation of each party to that document, enforceable against each such party in accordance with its respective terms and that each such party has satisfied all legal requirements that are applicable to such party to the extent necessary to entitle such party to enforce such agreement and that each party to the Credit Agreement is in good standing and duly incorporated or organized under the laws of its jurisdiction of organization except we do not assume in this paragraph (b) that the Credit Agreement is a valid and binding obligation enforceable in accordance with its terms against the Borrowers; (c) there are no agreements or understandings among the parties, written or oral (other than the Credit Agreement), and there is no usage of trade or course of prior dealing among the parties that would, in either case define, supplement or qualify the terms of the Credit Agreement; and (d) that the status of the Credit Agreement as legally valid and binding obligations of the parties is not affected by any (i) breaches of, or defaults under, agreements or instruments, (ii) violations of statutes, rules, regulations or court or governmental orders, or (iii) failures to obtain required consents, approvals or authorizations from, or make required registrations, declarations or filings with, governmental authorities. In preparing this letter, we have relied without any independent verification upon: (i) information contained in certificates obtained from governmental authorities; (ii) factual information represented to be true in the Credit Agreement; (iii) factual information provided to us in a support certificate signed by each of the Borrowers; and (iv) factual information we have obtained from such other sources as we have deemed reasonable; and we have examined the originals or copies certified to our satisfaction, of the Credit Agreement and other corporate records of the Borrowers as we deem necessary for or relevant to our opinions. We have assumed without investigation that the information upon which we have relied is accurate and does not omit disclosures necessary to prevent such information from being misleading. The terms knowledge , actual knowledge and aware whenever used in this letter with respect to our firm mean conscious awareness at the time this letter is delivered on the date it bears by the lawyers with Kirkland Ellis LLP at that time who spent substantial time representing the Borrower in connection with the Credit Agreement (herein called our Designated Transaction Lawyers ). Our opinion (an enforceability opinion in this letter that any particular contract is a valid and binding obligation or is enforceable in accordance with its terms is subject to: (i) applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization, moratorium and similar laws affecting creditors rights and remedies generally and judicially developed doctrines in this area such as substantive consolidation and equitable subordination; (ii) the effect of general principles of equity (regardless of whether enforcement is sought in a proceeding at law or in equity); (iii) an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing; and (iv) other commonly recognized statutory and judicial constraints on enforceability including statutes of limitations. General principles of equity include but are not limited to: principles limiting the availability of specific performance and injunctive relief; principles which limit the availability of a remedy under certain circumstances where another remedy has been elected; principles requiring reasonableness, good faith and fair dealing in the performance and enforcement of an agreement by the party seeking enforcement; principles which may permit a party to cure a material failure to perform its obligations; and principles affording equitable defenses such as waiver, laches and estoppel. Our enforceability opinion is also subject to the qualification that certain provisions of the Credit Agreement may not be enforceable in whole or in part, although the inclusion of such provisions does not render the Credit Agreement invalid, and the Credit Agreement and the law of the State of New York contain adequate remedial provisions for the practical realization of the rights and benefits afforded thereby. 

I- 3 
 Our enforceability opinion is further subject to the effect of rules of law that may render guaranties or other similar instruments or agreements unenforceable under circumstances where your actions, failures to act or waivers, amendments or replacement of the Credit Agreement (i) so radically change the essential nature of the terms and conditions of the guaranteed obligations and the related transactions that, in effect, a new relationship has arisen between you and the Borrowers which is substantially and materially different from that presently contemplated by the Credit Agreement, (ii) release the primary obligor, or (iii) impair the guarantor s recourse against the primary obligor. We also express no opinion regarding the enforceability of any so-called fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer savings clauses and any similar provisions in the Credit Agreement to the extent such provisions purport to limit the amount of the obligations of any party or the right to contribution of any other party with respect to such obligations. We render no opinion regarding the validity, binding effect or enforceability of the Credit Agreement with respect to any Borrower to the extent the Credit Agreement involves any obligation (including any guaranty) of such Borrower with respect to any swap (as such term is defined in the Commodity Exchange Act) if such Borrower is not an eligible contract participant (as such term is defined in the Commodity Exchange Act) at the time such obligation is incurred by such Borrower. We render no opinion with regard to usury or other laws limiting or regulating the maximum amount of interest that may be charged, collected, received or contracted for other than the internal laws of the State of New York, and without limiting the foregoing, we expressly disclaim any opinion as to the usury or other such laws of any other jurisdiction (including laws of other states made applicable through principles of Federal preemption or otherwise) which may be applicable to the transactions contemplated by the Credit Agreement. Nothing contained in this letter covers or otherwise addresses any of the following types of provisions which may be contained in the Credit Agreement: (i) provisions mandating contribution towards judgments or settlements among various parties; (ii) waivers of benefits and rights to the extent they cannot be waived under applicable law; (iii) provisions providing for penalties, liquidated damages, acceleration of future amounts due (other than principal) without appropriate discount to present value, late charges, prepayment charges, interest upon interest, or increased interest rates upon default; (iv) provisions which might require indemnification or contribution in violation of general principles of equity or public policy, including, without limitation, indemnification or contribution obligations which arise out of the failure to comply with applicable state or federal securities laws; (v) agreements to submit to the jurisdiction of any particular court or other governmental authority (either as to personal or subject matter jurisdiction); provisions restricting access to courts; waiver of service of process requirements which would otherwise be applicable; waiver of the right to a jury trial and provisions otherwise purporting to affect the jurisdiction and venue of courts; (vi) choice-of-law provisions; (vii) provisions regarding arbitration; (viii) covenants not to compete; 

I- 4 
 (ix) provisions that authorize you to set off and apply any deposits at any time held, and any other indebtedness at any time owing, by you to or for the account of the Borrowers, or (x) requirements in the Credit Agreement specifying that provisions thereof may only be waived in writing. Except as expressly otherwise set forth in this letter, our advice on every legal issue addressed in this letter is based exclusively on the internal laws of the State of New York or the Federal law of the United States which, in each case, in our experience is generally applicable both to general business organizations which are not engaged in regulated business activities and to transactions of the type contemplated in the Credit Agreement, on the one hand, and you, on the other hand (but without our having made any special investigation as to any other laws), except that we express no opinion or advice as to any law or legal issue (a) which might be violated by any misrepresentation or omission or a fraudulent act, or (b) to which any Borrower may be subject as a result of your legal or regulatory status, your sale or transfer of the Loans or interests therein or your involvement in the transactions contemplated by the Credit Agreement. None of the opinions or other advice contained in this letter considers or covers: (i) any federal or state securities (or blue sky laws or regulations or Federal Reserve Board margin regulations or (ii) federal or state antitrust and unfair competition laws and regulations, pension and employee benefit laws and regulations, compliance with fiduciary duty requirements, federal and state environmental, land use and subdivision, tax, racketeering (e.g., RICO), health and safety (e.g., OSHA), and labor laws and regulations, federal and state laws, regulations and policies concerning national and local emergency, possible judicial deference to acts of sovereign states and criminal and civil forfeiture laws, and other federal and state statutes of general application to the extent they provide for criminal prosecution (e.g., mail fraud and wire fraud statutes). We also express no opinion regarding any laws relating to terrorism or money laundering, including Executive Order No. 13224, 66 Fed. Reg. 49079 (published September 25, 2001) (the Terrorism Executive Order or any related enabling legislation or any other similar executive order (collectively with the Terrorism Executive Order, the Executive Orders ), the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (Public Law 107-56, the Patriot Act ), any sanctions and regulations promulgated under authority granted by the Trading with the Enemy Act, 50 U.S.C.

L. No. 106-120, as amended from time to time. We express no opinion as to what law might be applied by any other courts to resolve any issue addressed in this letter. We advise you that issues addressed by this letter may be governed in whole or in part by other laws, but we express no opinion as to whether any relevant difference exists between the laws upon which our opinions are based and any other laws which may actually govern. This opinion letter speaks as of the time of its delivery on the date it bears. We do not assume any obligation to provide you with any subsequent opinion or advice by reason of any fact about which our Designated Transaction Lawyers did not have actual knowledge at that time, by reason of any change subsequent to that time in any law covered by any of our opinions, or for any other reason.

1.4 Interest Rates; LIBOR Notification . The interest rate on Eurocurrency Loans denominated in Dollars and certain Foreign Currencies may be derived from an interest rate benchmark that is, or may in the future become, the subject of regulatory reform. Regulators have signaled the need to use alternative benchmark reference rates for some of these interest rate benchmarks and, as a result, such interest rate benchmarks may cease to comply with applicable laws and regulations, may be permanently discontinued, and/or the basis on which they are calculated may change. The London interbank offered rate is intended to represent the rate at which contributing banks may obtain short-term borrowings from each other in the London interbank market. In July 2017, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority announced that, after the end of 2021, it would no longer persuade or compel contributing banks to make rate submissions to the ICE Benchmark Administration (together with any successor to the ICE Benchmark Administrator, the IBA for purposes of the IBA setting the London interbank offered rate. As a result, it is possible that commencing in 2022, the London interbank offered rate may no longer be available or may no longer be deemed an appropriate reference rate upon which to determine the interest rate on Eurocurrency Loans. In light of this eventuality, public and private sector industry initiatives are currently underway to identify new or alternative reference rates to be used in place of the London interbank offered rate. Upon the occurrence of a Benchmark Transition Event, a Term SOFR Transition Event or an Early Opt-In Election with respect to any applicable Currency, subsection 2.11(b) and (c) provide a mechanism for determining an alternative rate of interest. The Administrative Agent will promptly notify the Borrower, pursuant to subsection 2.11(e), of any change to the reference rate upon which the interest rate on Eurocurrency Loans is based. However, the Administrative Agent does not warrant or accept any responsibility for, and shall not have any liability with respect to, the administration, submission or any other matter related to Daily Simple SONIA, the London interbank offered rate or other rates in the definition of Eurocurrency Rate or with respect to any alternative or successor rate thereto, or replacement rate thereof (including, without limitation, (i) any such alternative, successor or replacement rate implemented pursuant to subsection 2.11(b) or (c), whether upon the occurrence of a Benchmark Transition Event, a Term SOFR Transition Event or an Early Opt-in Election, and (ii) the implementation of any Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes pursuant to subsection 2.11(d)), including without limitation, whether the composition or characteristics of any such alternative, successor or replacement reference rate for any Currency will be similar to, or produce the same value or economic equivalence of, Adjusted Daily Simple SONIA, the Eurocurrency Rate or applicable Screen Rate for Loans denominated in such Currency or have the same volume or liquidity as did the London interbank offered rate (or the euro interbank offered rate, as applicable) prior to its discontinuance or unavailability . The Administrative Agent and its affiliates and/or other related entities may engage in transactions that affect the calculation of Adjusted Daily Simple SONIA, any alternative, successor or alternative rate (including any Benchmark Replacement) and/or any relevant adjustments thereto, in each case, in a manner adverse to the Borrowers. The Administrative Agent may select information sources or services in its reasonable discretion to ascertain SONIA or Daily Simple SONIA, any component thereof, or rates referenced in the definition thereof, in each case pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, and shall have no liability to the Borrowers, any Bank or any other person or entity for damages of any kind, including direct or indirect, special, punitive, incidental or consequential damages, costs, losses or expenses (whether in tort, contract or otherwise and whether at law or in equity), for any error or calculation of any such rate (or component thereof) provided by any such information source or service.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, if a Benchmark Transition Event or an Early Opt-in Election, as applicable, and its related Benchmark Replacement Date have occurred prior to the Reference Time in respect of any setting of the then-current Benchmark with respect to a Loan denominated in any Currency, then (x) if a Benchmark Replacement for a Loan denominated in such Currency is determined in accordance with clause (1) or (2) of the definition of Benchmark Replacement for such Benchmark Replacement Date, such Benchmark Replacement will replace such Benchmark for a Loan denominated in such Currency for all purposes hereunder and under any Loan Document in respect of such Benchmark setting and subsequent Benchmark settings without any amendment to, or further action or consent of any other party to, this Agreement or any other Loan Document and (y) if a Benchmark Replacement for a Loan denominated in such Currency is determined in accordance with clause (3) of the definition of Benchmark Replacement for such Benchmark Replacement Date such Benchmark Replacement will replace such Benchmark for all purposes hereunder and under any Loan Document in respect of any Benchmark setting at or after 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the fifth (5th) Business Day after the date notice of such Benchmark Replacement is provided to the Banks without any amendment to, or further action or consent of any other party to, this Agreement or any other Loan Document so long as the Administrative Agent has not received, by such time, written notice of objection to such Benchmark Replacement from Banks comprising the Majority Banks. (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document and subject to the proviso below in this paragraph, solely with respect to a Loan denominated in Dollars, if a Term SOFR Transition Event and its related Benchmark Replacement Date have occurred prior to the Reference Time in respect of any setting of the then-current Benchmark, then the applicable Benchmark Replacement will replace the then-current Benchmark for all purposes hereunder or under any Loan Document in respect of such Benchmark setting and subsequent Benchmark settings, without any amendment to, or further action or consent of any other party to, this Agreement or any other Loan Document; provided that, this clause (c) shall not be effective unless the Administrative Agent has delivered to the Banks and the Company a Term SOFR Notice. (d) In connection with the implementation of a Benchmark Replacement, the Administrative Agent, in consultation with the Company, will have the right to make Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes from time to time and, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, any amendments implementing such Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes will become effective without any further action or consent of any other party to this Agreement or any other Loan Document. 

41 

(e) The Administrative Agent will promptly notify the Company and the Banks of (i) any occurrence of a Benchmark Transition Event, a Term SOFR Transition Event or an Early Opt-in Election, as applicable, and its related Benchmark Replacement Date, (ii) the implementation of any Benchmark Replacement, (iii) the effectiveness of any Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes, (iv) the removal or reinstatement of any tenor of a Benchmark pursuant to clause (f) below and (v) the commencement or conclusion of any Benchmark Unavailability Period. Any determination, decision or election that may be made by the Administrative Agent or, if applicable, any Bank (or group of Banks) pursuant to this subsection 2.11, including any determination with respect to a tenor, rate or adjustment or of the occurrence or non-occurrence of an event, circumstance or date and any decision to take or refrain from taking any action or any selection, will be conclusive and binding absent manifest error and may be made in its or their sole discretion and without consent from any other party hereto or any other Loan Document, except, in each case, as expressly required pursuant to this subsection 2.11. (f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, at any time (including in connection with the implementation of a Benchmark Replacement), (i) if the then-current Benchmark is a term rate (including Term SOFR or Eurocurrency Rate) and either (A) any tenor for such Benchmark is not displayed on a screen or other information service that publishes such rate from time to time as selected by the Administrative Agent in its reasonable discretion or (B) the regulatory supervisor for the administrator of such Benchmark has provided a public statement or publication of information announcing that any tenor for such Benchmark is or will be no longer representative, then the Administrative Agent may modify the definition of Interest Period for any Benchmark settings at or after such time to remove such unavailable or non-representative tenor and (ii) if a tenor that was removed pursuant to clause (i) above either (A) is subsequently displayed on a screen or information service for a Benchmark (including a Benchmark Replacement) or (B) is not, or is no longer, subject to an announcement that it is or will no longer be representative for a Benchmark (including a Benchmark Replacement), then the Administrative Agent shall modify the definition of Interest Period for all Benchmark settings at or after such time to reinstate such previously removed tenor. (g) Upon the Company s receipt of notice of the commencement of a Benchmark Unavailability Period with respect to the Relevant Rate applicable to any Eurocurrency Loan , and or SONIA Loan, as applicable, and, with respect to such Eurocurrency Loans, during the continuance thereof (in each case below, to the extent such Benchmark Unavailability Period is in respect of the Relevant Rate applicable to such Eurocurrency Loan or such SONIA Loan, as applicable ), (i) a Borrower may revoke any request for a Eurocurrency Loan or SONIA Loan to be made during such Benchmark Unavailability Period, and, failing that, the applicable Borrower will be deemed to have converted such request for a Eurocurrency Loan denominated in Dollars into a request for an ABR Loan and (ii) any request for a Eurocurrency Loan denominated in a Foreign Currency or a SONIA Loan shall be ineffective. During any Benchmark Unavailability Period or at any time that a tenor for the then-current Benchmark is not an Available Tenor, the component of ABR based upon the then-current Benchmark or such tenor for such Benchmark, as applicable, will not be used in any determination of ABR. Furthermore, if any Eurocurrency Loan in any Currency or SONIA Loan is outstanding on the date of the Company s receipt of notice of the commencement of a Benchmark Unavailability Period with respect to the Relevant Rate applicable to such Eurocurrency Loan or SONIA Loan, as applicable , then (i) if such Eurocurrency Loan is denominated in Dollars, on the last day of the Interest Period applicable to such Loan (or the next succeeding Business Day if such day is not a Business Day), such Loan shall be converted by the Administrative Agent to, and shall constitute, an ABR Loan denominated in Dollars on such day or , (ii) if such Eurocurrency Loan is denominated in any Foreign Currency, such Loan shall, on the last day of the Interest Period applicable to such Loan (or the next succeeding Business Day if such day is not a Business Day), at the applicable Borrower s election prior to such day: (A) be prepaid by the applicable Borrower on such day or (B) be converted by the Administrative Agent to, and shall constitute, an ABR Loan denominated in Dollars (in an amount equal to the Dollar Equivalent of the amount of such 

42 

Eurocurrency Loan on such day (it being understood and agreed that if the applicable Borrower does not so prepay such Loan on such day by 12:00 noon, Local Time, the Administrative Agent is authorized to effect such conversion of such Eurocurrency Loan into an ABR Loan denominated in Dollars)); provided that, in the case of this subclause (B), upon any subsequent implementation of a Benchmark Replacement in respect of such Foreign Currency pursuant to this subsection 2.11, such ABR Loan denominated in Dollars shall then be converted by the Administrative Agent to, and shall constitute, a Eurocurrency Loan denominated in the original Foreign Currency applicable to such Loan (in an amount equal to the Foreign Currency Equivalent of the amount of such ABR Loan) on the day of, and after giving effect to, such implementation . or (iii) such SONIA Loan shall bear interest at the Central Bank Rate for Pounds Sterling plus the CBR Spread; provided that, if the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive and binding absent manifest error) that the Central Bank Rate for Pounds Sterling cannot be determined, any outstanding affected SONIA Loans, at the Company s election, shall either (A) be converted into ABR Loans denominated in Dollars (in an amount equal to the Dollar Equivalent of Pounds Sterling) immediately or (B) be prepaid in full immediately. 2.12 Pro Rata Treatment and Payments . (a) All payments (including prepayments) to be made by the Borrowers on account of principal, Reimbursement Obligations, interest and fees shall be made without defense, set-off or counterclaim and shall be made, in the case of fees and principal of, and interest on, Loans (other than Negotiated Rate Loans) and Reimbursement Obligations at the Administrative Agent s office specified in subsection 10.2, in each case in the relevant Currency in which the Loan was made (and in Dollars in the case of Reimbursement Obligations) and in immediately available funds not later than 11:00 A.M. (Local Time) on the date due. The Administrative Agent shall distribute such payments to the Banks entitled thereto on the day of receipt in like funds as received, provided that the Administrative Agent shall have received such payments not later than 11:00 A.M. (Local Time). If the Administrative Agent shall distribute such payments to the Banks entitled thereto on a date after the date on which such payments were received prior to 11:00 A.M. (Local Time), the Administrative Agent shall pay to each such Bank on demand an amount equal to the product of (i) the daily average applicable Overnight Rate, times (ii) the amount of such Bank s share of such payment, times (iii) a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days that elapse from and including such date of receipt of payment by the Administrative Agent to but excluding the date on which such Bank s share of such payment shall have become immediately available to such Bank and the denominator of which is 360. All payments (including prepayments) to be made by the Borrowers on account of principal, interest and fees relating to Negotiated Rate Loans shall be made to the Bank with respect thereto on such terms, at such address and at such time as shall be mutually agreed upon between the relevant Borrower and the relevant Bank in lawful money of the United States of America on the date due. 
 (b) (i) Each borrowing by a Borrower of Committed Rate Loans and each payment of principal in respect of Committed Rate Loans (subject to the provisions of subsection 2.20(e)) shall be made in accordance with the following requirements: (A) All borrowings of Committed Rate Loans and all principal payments in respect of such Loans, shall be made pro rata according to the respective Commitments of the Banks. 
 (B) As provided in clause (b)(ii) below, if any principal payment is made in respect of any Loans (other than Negotiated Rate Loans) on any day on which principal amounts are due and owing in respect of any Loans (other than Negotiated Rate Loans), such principal payment shall be applied to the Banks pro rata according to the respective amounts of principal due and owing to the Banks under this Agreement. 

43 

(ii) Except as provided in subsections 2.13, 2.16 and 2.17, each reduction of the Commitments shall be made pro rata among the Banks according to their respective Commitment Percentages. Each payment by the Borrowers under this Agreement or of any Loan (other than Negotiated Rate Loans) shall be applied, first , to any fees then due and owing pursuant to subsections 2.4 and 2.26, second , to interest then due and owing in respect of the Loans (other than Negotiated Rate Loans) and Reimbursement Obligations and third , to principal then due and owing hereunder (other than principal due and owing under Negotiated Rate Loans) under the Loans (other than Negotiated Rate Loans) and Reimbursement Obligations. Each payment made by the Company or the Capital Corporation under this Agreement relating to a Negotiated Rate Loan to the Bank with respect thereto shall be applied, first , to interest then due and owing in respect of such Negotiated Rate Loan and second , to principal then due and owing hereunder with respect to such Negotiated Rate Loan and under such Negotiated Rate Loan. Each payment (other than voluntary prepayments made when no principal payments are due and owing hereunder) by a Borrower on account of principal of and interest on the Loans (other than Negotiated Rate Loans) and Reimbursement Obligations shall be made for the account of each Bank pro rata according to the respective amounts of principal, Reimbursement Obligations and interest due and owing to such Bank under this Agreement. Subject to the requirements of clause (i) of this paragraph (b), each payment by a Borrower on account of principal of the Loans (other than Negotiated Rate Loans) and Reimbursement Obligations shall be applied, first , to such of its Committed Rate Loan borrowings and Reimbursement Obligations as such Borrower may designate and, second , after all Committed Rate Loans and Reimbursement Obligations shall have been paid in full, to all of its Absolute Rate Bid Loans or Index Rate Bid Loans made on the same Borrowing Date with the same Interest Period as such Borrower may designate, pro rata according to the respective amounts outstanding; provided , however , that prepayments made pursuant to subsection 2.13(a), (b) or (c), 2.16(c) or 2.17(b) shall be applied in accordance with such subsection. 
 (c) If any payment hereunder (other than payments on the Eurocurrency Loans and Index Rate Bid Loans) becomes due and payable on a day other than a Business Day, such payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day. If any payment on a Eurocurrency Loan or Index Rate Bid Loan becomes due and payable on a day other than a Working Day, the maturity thereof shall be extended to the next succeeding Working Day unless the result of such extension would be to extend such payment into another calendar month in which event such payment shall be made on the immediately preceding Working Day. With respect to any extension of the payment of principal pursuant to this subsection 2.12(c), interest thereon shall be payable at the then applicable rate during such extension. (d) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have been notified in writing by any Bank prior to the date of the Committed Rate Loan, Committed Rate Loans, Bid Loan or Bid Loans to be made by such Bank (which notice shall be effective upon receipt) that such Bank will not make its pro rata share of the amount of the requested borrowing on such date available to the Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Bank has made such amount available to it on such date and the Administrative Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the relevant Borrower a corresponding amount. If a Bank shall make such amount available to the Administrative Agent on a date after such Borrowing Date, such Bank shall pay to the Administrative Agent on demand an amount equal to the product of (i) the daily average applicable Overnight Rate, times (ii) the amount of such Bank s pro rata share of such borrowing, times (iii) a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days that elapse from and including such Borrowing Date to but excluding the date on which such Bank s pro rata share of such borrowing shall have become immediately available to the Administrative Agent and the denominator of which is 360. A certificate of the Administrative Agent submitted to any Bank with respect to any amounts owing under this subsection 2.12(d) shall be conclusive, absent manifest error. If such Bank s pro rata share is not in fact made available to the Administrative Agent by such Bank within three Business Days of such Borrowing Date, the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to recover such amount, on demand, from the relevant Borrower with interest thereon at the rate equal to the 

44 

product of (i) during the period from and including such Borrowing Date to the Business Day next following the date of such demand, the daily average applicable Overnight Rate, times a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days that elapse from and including such Borrowing Date to but excluding the Business Day next following the date of such demand and the denominator of which is 360 and (ii) thereafter, the interest rate or rates applicable to the Loan or Loans funded by the Administrative Agent on behalf of such Bank on such Borrowing Date, times a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days which elapse from and including the Business Day next following the date of such demand to but excluding the date such amount is recovered by the Administrative Agent from such Borrower and the denominator of which is 360. In the event any Bank s pro rata share of a borrowing is not made available to the Administrative Agent in accordance with this paragraph within three Business Days of the applicable Borrowing Date (i) such Bank shall, during the period from such Borrowing Date to the date such Bank makes its pro rata share of the applicable borrowing available, not accrue and shall not be entitled to receive any commitment fee under subsection 2.4 and (ii) each Borrower may exercise or pursue any other rights, remedies, powers and privileges against such Bank as are provided by law or by contract. 2.13 Requirements of Law . (a) If any Bank shall determine that by reason of (i) the introduction after the date hereof of any applicable law, regulation or guideline or any change after the date hereof in any applicable law, regulation or guideline (including the phasing-in of a provision of any applicable law, regulation or guideline) or in the interpretation thereof by any governmental or other regulatory authority charged with the administration thereof or any court of competent jurisdiction and/or (ii) compliance by such Bank with any requirement adopted after the date hereof or directive adopted after the date hereof from any central bank or other fiscal, monetary or other regulatory authority (whether or not having the force of law), there shall be any increase in the cost of such Bank of maintaining or giving effect to its obligations with respect to Committed Rate Loans or Letters of Credit under this Agreement or maintaining its Commitment with respect to Committed Rate Loans or Letters of Credit or making or maintaining any Eurocurrency Loans or SONIA Loans or any reduction in any amount receivable by such Bank in respect of Eurocurrency Loans or SONIA Loans under this Agreement, notwithstanding the reasonable efforts (such reasonable efforts not to result in the incurrence of additional costs or expenses) of such Bank to mitigate such increase or reduction (excluding for purposes of this subsection 2.13 any such increased costs resulting from (x) Indemnified Taxes (as to which subsection 2.17 shall govern), (y) changes in the basis of taxation of overall net income or overall gross income by the United States or by the foreign jurisdiction or state under the laws of which such Bank is organized or has its applicable lending office or any political subdivision thereof and (z) FATCA), then the relevant Borrower shall from time to time on receipt (whenever occurring) of a certificate from such Bank (which shall be executed by an officer thereof and a copy of which shall be delivered to the Administrative Agent) pay to such Bank such amounts as are stated therein to be required to indemnify such Bank against such increased costs or reduction; provided , however, that if such Borrower becomes obligated to pay any Bank any additional amount pursuant to this subsection 2.13(a), such Borrower shall have the right, so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is then continuing, upon giving notice to the Administrative Agent and such Bank in accordance with subsection 2.6, to prepay in full the Loans of such Bank, together with accrued interest thereon, any amounts payable to such Bank pursuant to subsections 2.13, 2.14, 2.15 and 2.17 and any accrued and unpaid commitment fee, Letter of Credit Fee, Reimbursement Obligations in respect of Letters of Credit or other amount payable to such Bank hereunder and/or, upon giving not less than three Business Days notice to any such Bank and the Administrative Agent, to cancel the whole or part of the Commitment of any such Bank (and upon such cancellation, such Bank s participation in any then outstanding undrawn Letters of Credit shall terminate) (it being understood that any partial cancellation of the Commitment shall result in a corresponding reduction of such Bank s participating interest in respect of Letters of Credit); provided , further, that such Borrower shall not be obligated to pay any Bank any additional amount pursuant to this subsection 2.13(a) (A) which constitutes a present or future income, stamp or other tax, levy, impost, 

45 

duty, charge, fee, deduction or withholding referred to in subsection 2.17(a) or (B) as a result of any law, rule, guideline, regulation, request or directive regarding capital adequacy or liquidity referred to in subsection 2.13(b). A certificate of such Bank as to the amount of such increased costs or reduction shall set forth in reasonable detail the computation of such increased costs or reduction, and shall be binding and conclusive in the absence of manifest error. A Bank which demands indemnification hereunder as a result of an increased cost or reduction referred to herein shall deliver the certificate referred to above to the relevant Borrower demanding indemnification no later than the later of (y) the thirtieth day immediately following each payment or realization by such Bank of such increased cost or reduction (and such certificate shall certify that the amounts set forth therein were paid or realized within such thirty-day period) and (z) the thirtieth day immediately following such Bank s knowledge of the incurrence or realization by such Bank of such increased cost or reduction (and such certificate shall so certify). (b) In the event that any Bank shall have determined that the adoption after the date hereof of any law, rule, guideline or regulation regarding capital adequacy or liquidity, or any change after the date hereof in any existing or future law, rule, guideline or regulation regarding capital adequacy or liquidity (excluding, however, the phasing-in of any existing law, rule, regulation or guideline regarding capital adequacy or liquidity) or in the interpretation or application thereof or compliance by such Bank or any corporation controlling such Bank with any request or directive made or adopted after the date hereof regarding capital adequacy or liquidity (whether or not having the force of law) from any central bank or Governmental Authority, does or shall have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Bank s or such corporation s capital as a consequence of its obligations hereunder to a level below that which such Bank or such corporation could have achieved but for such adoption, change or compliance (taking into consideration such Bank s or such corporation s policies with respect to capital adequacy or liquidity) by an amount deemed by such Bank to be material, then from time to time, within 30 days after receipt (whenever occurring) of a certificate from such Bank (which shall be executed by an officer thereof and a copy of which shall be delivered to the Administrative Agent), the Company and the Capital Corporation jointly and severally agree to pay to such Bank such additional amounts as are stated therein to be required to compensate it for such reduction; provided , however , that if such Borrower becomes obligated to pay any Bank any additional amount pursuant to this subsection 2.13(b), such Borrower shall have the right, so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is then continuing, upon giving notice to the Administrative Agent and such Bank in accordance with subsection 2.6, to prepay in full the Loans of such Bank, together with accrued interest thereon, any amounts payable pursuant to subsections 2.13, 2.14, 2.15 and 2.17 and any accrued and unpaid commitment fee, Letter of Credit Fee, Reimbursement Obligations in respect of Letters of Credit or other amounts payable to it hereunder and/or, upon giving not less than three Business Days notice to any such Bank and the Administrative Agent, to cancel the whole or part of the Commitment of any such Bank (and upon such cancellation, such Bank s participation in any then outstanding undrawn Letters of Credit shall terminate) (it being understood that any partial cancellation of the Commitment shall result in a corresponding reduction of such Bank s participating interest in respect of Letters of Credit) (but only if after giving effect to such cancellation and prepayment the Total Extensions of Credit do not exceed the Total Commitments). A certificate of such Bank as to the amount of such reduction shall set forth in reasonable detail the computation of such reduction, and shall be binding and conclusive in the absence of manifest error. A Bank which demands indemnification hereunder as a result of a reduction referred to herein shall deliver the certificate referred to above to the relevant Borrower demanding indemnification no later than the later of (i) the thirtieth day immediately following each realization by such Bank of such reduction (and such certificate shall certify that the amounts set forth therein were realized within such thirty-day period) and (ii) the thirtieth day immediately following such Bank s knowledge of the realization by such Bank of such reduction (and such certificate shall so certify). 
 (c) Each Borrower shall pay to each Bank that delivers a certificate to such Borrower in accordance with this subsection (c) such amounts as shall be necessary to reimburse such Bank for the 

46 

costs (determined in accordance with the immediately following sentence), if any, incurred by such Bank, as a result of the application to such Bank during any period on which there are outstanding Eurocurrency Loans advanced by such Bank to such Borrower of basic, supplemental, marginal and emergency reserves under any regulations of the Board or other Governmental Authority having jurisdiction with respect thereto dealing with reserve requirements prescribed for eurocurrency funding (currently referred to as Eurocurrency liabilities in Regulation D of such Board) maintained by a member bank of such system (any such reserves dealing with reserve requirements prescribed for eurocurrency funding being referred to as Reserves ), such amount to be set forth in a certificate of such Bank delivered to the relevant Borrower; provided , however , that if a Bank gives to a Borrower the written notice contemplated by the proviso set forth in the second following sentence, such Borrower shall have the right, so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is then continuing, upon giving notice to the Administrative Agent and such Bank in accordance with subsection 2.6, to prepay in full the Loans of such Bank, together with accrued interest thereon, any amounts payable pursuant to subsections 2.13, 2.14, 2.15 and 2.17 and any accrued and unpaid commitment fee, Letter of Credit Fee, Reimbursement Obligations in respect of Letters of Credit or other amounts payable to it hereunder and/or upon giving not less than three Working Days notice to such Bank and the Administrative Agent, to cancel the whole or part of the Commitment of any such Bank (and upon such cancellation, such Bank s participation in any then outstanding undrawn Letters of Credit shall terminate) (it being understood that any partial cancellation of the Commitment shall result in a corresponding reduction of such Bank s participating interest in respect of Letters of Credit). Amounts certified by a Bank hereunder for any period shall represent such Bank s calculation or, if an accurate calculation is impracticable, reasonable estimate (using such reasonable means of allocation as such Bank shall determine) of the actual costs, if any, theretofore incurred by such Bank as a result of the application of Reserves to Eurocurrency liabilities (as referred to in Regulation D referred to above) of such Bank in an amount equal to such Bank s Eurocurrency Loans during such period and in any event shall not exceed the amount obtainable utilizing the maximum Reserves prescribed by the Board or other Governmental Authority having jurisdiction with respect thereto for such period. Such payment shall be made within fifteen days after receipt by the relevant Borrower of a certificate, signed by an officer of the Bank delivering such certificate, which certificate shall be binding and conclusive in the absence of demonstrable error, specifying the period (prior to the date of such certificate) during which the cost set forth therein was incurred by such Bank and stating (i) that such amount represents the actual cost, or, if an accurate calculation of such cost is impracticable stating that such amount represents such Bank s reasonable estimate of the actual cost, incurred by such Bank during such period as a result of the application of Reserves to Eurocurrency liabilities of such Bank in an amount equal to such Bank s Eurocurrency Loans during such period and specified in such certificate and (ii) that the amount set forth therein does not in any event exceed the amount obtainable utilizing the maximum Reserves prescribed for such period by the Board or such other Governmental Authority having jurisdiction with respect thereto; provided that the obligation of the Borrowers to pay any amounts pursuant to this subsection 2.13(c) shall apply only in the case of those Banks that give to the relevant Borrower and the Administrative Agent, no later than 3:00 P.M. (Local Time) on the day that is two Working Days prior to the applicable Borrowing Date therefor, a written notice stating that such Bank intends to demand reimbursement pursuant hereto. A Bank which demands reimbursement of Reserve costs hereunder on account of a Eurocurrency Loan made by such Bank shall deliver the certificate referred to in the preceding sentence to the relevant Borrower setting forth the items specified in clauses (i) and (ii) of the preceding sentence no later than the thirtieth day immediately following the last day of the Interest Period applicable to such Eurocurrency Loan. 
 (d) If any Governmental Authority of the jurisdiction of any Foreign Currency (or any other jurisdiction in which the funding operations of any Bank shall be conducted with respect to such Foreign Currency) shall put into effect after the date hereof any reserve, liquid asset or similar requirement with respect to any category of deposits or liabilities customarily used to fund loans in such Foreign Currency (excluding any Reserves), or by reference to which interest rates applicable to loans in 

47 

such Foreign Currency are determined, and the result of such requirement shall be to increase the cost to such Bank of making or maintaining any Foreign Currency Loan in such Foreign Currency, and such Bank shall deliver to the Borrowers a notice requesting compensation under this paragraph, then the Borrower will pay to such Bank on each Interest Payment Date with respect to each affected Foreign Currency Loan an amount that will compensate such Bank for such additional cost; provided , that the Borrowers shall not be required to compensate a Bank pursuant to this paragraph for any amounts incurred more than three months prior to the date that such Banks notifies the Borrowers of such Bank s intention to claim compensation therefor; and provided further that, if the circumstances giving rise to such claim have a retroactive effect, then such three-month period shall be extended to include the period of such retroactive effect. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a Bank gives to a Borrower the written notice contemplated by the proviso set forth in the following sentence, such Borrower shall have the right, so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is then continuing, upon giving notice to the Administrative Agent and such Bank in accordance with subsection 2.6, to prepay in full the Loans of such Bank, together with accrued interest thereon, any amounts payable pursuant to subsections 2.13, 2.14, 2.15 and 2.17 and any accrued and unpaid commitment fee, Letter of Credit Fee, Reimbursement Obligations in respect of Letters of Credit or other amounts payable to it hereunder and/or upon giving not less than three Working Days notice to such Bank and the Administrative Agent, to cancel the whole or part of the Commitment of any such Bank (and upon such cancellation, such Bank s participation in any then outstanding undrawn Letters of Credit shall terminate) (it being understood that any partial cancellation of the Commitment shall result in a corresponding reduction of such Bank s participating interest in respect of Letters of Credit). Such payment shall be made within fifteen days after receipt by the relevant Borrower of a certificate, signed by an officer of the Bank delivering such certificate, which certificate shall be binding and conclusive in the absence of demonstrable error, specifying the period (prior to the date of such certificate) during which the cost set forth therein was incurred by such Bank and stating (i) that such amount represents the actual cost, or, if an accurate calculation of such cost is impracticable stating that such amount represents such Bank s reasonable estimate of the actual cost, incurred by such Bank during such period as a result of the application of such reserve, liquid asset or similar requirements in an amount equal to such Bank s Foreign Currency Loans during such period and specified in such certificate and (ii) that the amount set forth therein does not in any event exceed the amount obtainable utilizing such reserves prescribed for such period by such Governmental Authority having jurisdiction with respect thereto; provided that the obligation of the Borrowers to pay any amounts pursuant to this subsection 2.13(d) shall apply only in the case of those Banks that give to the relevant Borrower and the Administrative Agent, no later than 3:00 P.M. (Local Time) on the day that is two Working Days prior to the applicable Borrowing Date therefor, a written notice stating that such Bank intends to demand reimbursement pursuant hereto. A Bank which demands reimbursement of reserve costs hereunder on account of a Foreign Currency Loan made by such Bank shall deliver the certificate referred to in the preceding sentence to the relevant Borrower setting forth the items specified in clauses (i) and (ii) of the preceding sentence no later than the thirtieth day immediately following the last day of the Interest Period applicable to such Foreign Currency Loan. 
 (e) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if (A) the adoption of any law, rule or regulation after the date of this Agreement, (B) any change in any law, rule or regulation or in the interpretation or application thereof by any Governmental Authority after the date of this Agreement or (C) compliance by any Bank with any request, guideline or directive (whether or not having the force of law) of any Governmental Authority made or issued after the date of this Agreement, shall make it unlawful for any such Bank to make or maintain any Foreign Currency Loan or to give effect to its obligations as contemplated hereby with respect to any Foreign Currency Loan, then, by written notice to the Borrowers and to the Administrative Agent: 
 (i) such Bank or Banks may declare that Foreign Currency Loans (in the affected Currency or Currencies) will not thereafter (for the duration of such unlawfulness) be 

48 

made by such Bank or Banks hereunder (or be continued for additional Interest Periods), whereupon any request for a Foreign Currency Loan (in the affected Currency or Currencies) or to continue a Foreign Currency Loan (in the affected Currency or Currencies, as the case may be, for an additional Interest Period) shall, as to such Bank or Banks only, be of no force and effect, unless such declaration shall be subsequently withdrawn; and 
 (ii) such Bank may require that all outstanding Foreign Currency Loans (in the affected Currency or Currencies), made by it be converted to ABR Loans or Eurocurrency Loans denominated in Dollars, as the case may be (unless repaid by the Borrowers), in which event all such Foreign Currency Loans (in the affected Currency or Currencies) shall be converted to ABR Loans or Eurocurrency Loans denominated in Dollars, as the case may be, as of the effective date of such notice as provided in paragraph (f) below and at the Exchange Rate on the date of such conversion or, at the option of the Borrower, repaid on the last day of the then current Interest Period with respect thereto or, if earlier, the date on which the applicable notice becomes effective. 
 In the event any Bank shall exercise its rights under (i) or (ii) above, all payments and prepayments of principal that would otherwise have been applied to repay the converted Foreign Currency Loans of such Bank shall instead be applied to repay the ABR Loans or Loans denominated in Dollars, as the case may be, made by such Bank resulting from such conversion. (f) For purposes of subsection 2.13(e), a notice to a Borrower by any Bank shall be effective as to each Foreign Currency Loan made by such Bank, if lawful, on the last day of the Interest Period currently applicable to such Foreign Currency Loan; in all other cases such notice shall be effective on the date of receipt thereof by such Borrower.

54 

indemnified party would have been in if the tax subject to indemnification and giving rise to such refund had not been deducted, withheld or otherwise imposed and the indemnification payments or additional amounts with respect to such tax had never been paid.

The Capital Corporation further agrees that its agreement hereunder constitutes a promise of payment when due and not of collection, and waives any right to require that any resort be had by any Bank to any balance of any deposit account or credit on the books of any Bank in favor of JD Luxembourg or any other Person. The obligations of the Capital Corporation hereunder shall not be subject to any reduction, limitation, impairment or termination for any reason, and shall not be subject to any defense or setoff, counterclaim, recoupment or termination whatsoever, by reason of the invalidity, illegality or unenforceability of the Luxembourg Obligations or otherwise.

63 

applicable Bank, the Capital Corporation shall make payment of such Luxembourg Obligation in Dollars (based upon the applicable Exchange Rate in effect on the date of payment) and/or in New York. Notwithstanding any payment made by the Capital Corporation hereunder or any set-off or application of funds of the Capital Corporation by the Administrative Agent or any Bank, the Capital Corporation shall not be entitled to be subrogated to any of the rights of the Administrative Agent or any Bank against JD Luxembourg or any guarantee or right of offset held by the Administrative Agent or any Bank for the payment of the Luxembourg Obligations, until all amounts owing to the Administrative Agent and the Banks by JD Luxembourg on account of the Luxembourg Obligations are paid in full in cash. If any amount shall be paid to the Capital Corporation on account of such subrogation rights at any time when all of the Luxembourg Obligations shall not have been paid in full in cash, such amount shall be held by the Capital Corporation in trust for the Administrative Agent and the Banks, segregated from its other funds, and shall, forthwith upon receipt by it, be turned over to the Administrative Agent in the exact form received by it (duly indorsed by it to the Administrative Agent, if required), to be applied against the Luxembourg Obligations, whether matured or unmatured, in such order as the Administrative Agent may determine.

EXHIBIT G [FORM OF OPINION OF GENERAL COUNSEL TO THE COMPANY] [Closing Date] To each of the Banks parties to the Credit Agreement referred to below and to JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Administrative Agent Deere Company and John Deere Capital Corporation 2026 Credit Agreement Ladies and Gentlemen: This opinion is furnished to you pursuant to subsection 4.1(c) of the 2,500,000,000 2026 Credit Agreement dated as of March 29, 2021 (the Credit Agreement among Deere Company (the Company ), John Deere Capital Corporation (the Capital Corporation and, together with the Company, the U.S. Borrowers and John Deere Bank S.A., the Banks parties thereto, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Administrative Agent, Citibank, N.A., as Documentation Agent, and Bank of America, N.A., as Syndication Agent. Terms defined in the Credit Agreement and not otherwise defined in this opinion are used herein as defined in the Credit Agreement. I am General Counsel of the Company and have also acted as counsel for the Capital Corporation in this matter. I am familiar with the corporate history and organization of each U.S. Borrower and of its Subsidiaries and the proceedings relating to the authorization, execution and delivery by each U.S. Borrower of the Credit Agreement. In that connection I have examined or caused to have examined: 1. The Credit Agreement; 2. The documents furnished by each of the U.S. Borrowers pursuant to Section 4 of the Credit Agreement; 3. The Certificates of Incorporation of the U.S. Borrowers and all amendments thereto (the Charters 4. The bylaws of the U.S. Borrowers and all amendments thereto (the Bylaws and 5. Certificates of the Secretary of State of Delaware, each dated a recent date, attesting to the continued corporate existence and good standing of the U.S. Borrowers in that State. In addition, I have reviewed or caused to have reviewed such of the corporate proceedings of the U.S. Borrowers, and have examined or caused to have examined such documents, corporate records, and other instruments relating to the organization of the U.S. Borrowers and their respective Subsidiaries and such other agreements and instruments to which the U.S. Borrowers and their respective Subsidiaries are parties, as I consider necessary as a basis for the opinions hereinafter expressed. I have assumed the due execution and delivery, pursuant to due authorization, of the Credit 

G- 2 
 Agreement by the Banks, the Administrative Agent, the Syndication Agent, and the Documentation Agent, and the authenticity of all documents submitted to me as originals and the conformity to the original documents of all documents submitted to me as certified, conformed or photostatic or electronic copies. I am qualified to practice law in the State of Illinois and the State of Iowa and do not purport to be an expert on, and do not express any opinion herein concerning, any laws other than the laws of the State of Illinois and the State of Iowa, the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware and the Federal laws of the United States. Based upon the foregoing and upon such investigation as I have deemed necessary, I am of the following opinion: 1. Each of the Company and the Capital Corporation is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware and has the corporate power and authority to carry on its business as now being conducted and to own its properties. 2. The execution, delivery and performance by each U.S. Borrower of the Credit Agreement are within such U.S. Borrower s corporate powers, have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action, and do not (i) contravene, or constitute a default under the Charter or the Bylaws of such U.S. Borrower, any judgment, law, rule or regulation applicable to such U.S. Borrower, or any Contractual Obligation by which such U.S. Borrower is bound or (ii) result in the creation of any lien, charge or encumbrance upon any of its property or assets. The Credit Agreement has been duly executed and delivered on behalf of each U.S. Borrower. 3. No authorization, approval, or other action by, and no notice to or filing with, any governmental authority or regulatory body is required for the due execution, delivery and performance by each U.S. Borrower of the Credit Agreement. 4. There is no pending or, to the best of my knowledge, threatened action or proceeding against either U.S. Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries before any court, governmental agency or arbitrator which is likely to have a materially adverse effect upon the financial condition or operations of such U.S. Borrower and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole. A copy of this opinion letter may be delivered by any of you to any person that becomes a Bank in accordance with the provisions of the Credit Agreement. Any such person may rely on the opinions expressed above as if this opinion letter were addressed and delivered to such person on the date hereof. This opinion letter is rendered to you in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Credit Agreement.

Subject to the assumptions, qualifications, exclusions and other limitations which are identified in this opinion letter, we advise you, and with respect to each legal issue addressed in this opinion letter, it is our opinion, that (a) the Credit Agreement is a valid and binding obligation of each Borrower that is a party thereto and is enforceable against such Borrower in accordance with its terms and (b) the guarantee by the Capital Corporation pursuant to Section 2.27 of the Credit Agreement is a valid and binding obligation of the Capital Corporation and is enforceable against the Capital Corporation in accordance with its terms. With your consent, we have assumed for purposes of this letter and the opinions herein: 

H- 2 
 (a) that each document we have reviewed for purposes of this letter is accurate and complete, each such document that is an original is authentic, each such document that is a copy conforms to an authentic original, and all signatures on each such document are genuine, and that all natural persons who have signed any document have the legal capacity to do so; (b) that the Credit Agreement and every other agreement we have examined for purposes of this letter has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the parties thereto and constitutes a valid and binding obligation of each party to that document, enforceable against each such party in accordance with its respective terms and that each such party has satisfied all legal requirements that are applicable to such party to the extent necessary to entitle such party to enforce such agreement and that each party to the Credit Agreement is in good standing and duly incorporated or organized under the laws of its jurisdiction of organization except we do not assume in this paragraph (b) that the Credit Agreement is a valid and binding obligation enforceable in accordance with its terms against the Borrowers; (c) there are no agreements or understandings among the parties, written or oral (other than the Credit Agreement), and there is no usage of trade or course of prior dealing among the parties that would, in either case define, supplement or qualify the terms of the Credit Agreement; and (d) that the status of the Credit Agreement as legally valid and binding obligations of the parties is not affected by any (i) breaches of, or defaults under, agreements or instruments, (ii) violations of statutes, rules, regulations or court or governmental orders, or (iii) failures to obtain required consents, approvals or authorizations from, or make required registrations, declarations or filings with, governmental authorities. In preparing this letter, we have relied without any independent verification upon: (i) information contained in certificates obtained from governmental authorities; (ii) factual information represented to be true in the Credit Agreement; (iii) factual information provided to us in a support certificate signed by each of the Borrowers; and (iv) factual information we have obtained from such other sources as we have deemed reasonable; and we have examined the originals or copies certified to our satisfaction, of the Credit Agreement and other corporate records of the Borrowers as we deem necessary for or relevant to our opinions. We have assumed without investigation that the information upon which we have relied is accurate and does not omit disclosures necessary to prevent such information from being misleading. The terms knowledge , actual knowledge and aware whenever used in this letter with respect to our firm mean conscious awareness at the time this letter is delivered on the date it bears by the lawyers with Kirkland Ellis LLP at that time who spent substantial time representing the Borrower in connection with the Credit Agreement (herein called our Designated Transaction Lawyers ). Our opinion (an enforceability opinion in this letter that any particular contract is a valid and binding obligation or is enforceable in accordance with its terms is subject to: (i) applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization, moratorium and similar laws affecting creditors rights and remedies generally and judicially developed doctrines in this area such as substantive consolidation and equitable subordination; (ii) the effect of general principles of equity (regardless of whether enforcement is sought in a proceeding at law or in equity); (iii) an 

H- 3 
 implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing; and (iv) other commonly recognized statutory and judicial constraints on enforceability including statutes of limitations. General principles of equity include but are not limited to: principles limiting the availability of specific performance and injunctive relief; principles which limit the availability of a remedy under certain circumstances where another remedy has been elected; principles requiring reasonableness, good faith and fair dealing in the performance and enforcement of an agreement by the party seeking enforcement; principles which may permit a party to cure a material failure to perform its obligations; and principles affording equitable defenses such as waiver, laches and estoppel. Our enforceability opinion is also subject to the qualification that certain provisions of the Credit Agreement may not be enforceable in whole or in part, although the inclusion of such provisions does not render the Credit Agreement invalid, and the Credit Agreement and the law of the State of New York contain adequate remedial provisions for the practical realization of the rights and benefits afforded thereby. Our enforceability opinion is further subject to the effect of rules of law that may render guaranties or other similar instruments or agreements unenforceable under circumstances where your actions, failures to act or waivers, amendments or replacement of the Credit Agreement (i) so radically change the essential nature of the terms and conditions of the guaranteed obligations and the related transactions that, in effect, a new relationship has arisen between you and the Borrowers which is substantially and materially different from that presently contemplated by the Credit Agreement, (ii) release the primary obligor, or (iii) impair the guarantor s recourse against the primary obligor. We also express no opinion regarding the enforceability of any so-called fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer savings clauses and any similar provisions in the Credit Agreement to the extent such provisions purport to limit the amount of the obligations of any party or the right to contribution of any other party with respect to such obligations. We render no opinion regarding the validity, binding effect or enforceability of the Credit Agreement with respect to any Borrower to the extent the Credit Agreement involves any obligation (including any guaranty) of such Borrower with respect to any swap (as such term is defined in the Commodity Exchange Act) if such Borrower is not an eligible contract participant (as such term is defined in the Commodity Exchange Act) at the time such obligation is incurred by such Borrower. We render no opinion with regard to usury or other laws limiting or regulating the maximum amount of interest that may be charged, collected, received or contracted for other than the internal laws of the State of New York, and without limiting the foregoing, we expressly disclaim any opinion as to the usury or other such laws of any other jurisdiction (including laws of other states made applicable through principles of Federal preemption or otherwise) which may be applicable to the transactions contemplated by the Credit Agreement. Nothing contained in this letter covers or otherwise addresses any of the following types of provisions which may be contained in the Credit Agreement: 

H- 4 
 (i) provisions mandating contribution towards judgments or settlements among various parties; (ii) waivers of benefits and rights to the extent they cannot be waived under applicable law; (iii) provisions providing for penalties, liquidated damages, acceleration of future amounts due (other than principal) without appropriate discount to present value, late charges, prepayment charges, interest upon interest, or increased interest rates upon default; (iv) provisions which might require indemnification or contribution in violation of general principles of equity or public policy, including, without limitation, indemnification or contribution obligations which arise out of the failure to comply with applicable state or federal securities laws; (v) agreements to submit to the jurisdiction of any particular court or other governmental authority (either as to personal or subject matter jurisdiction); provisions restricting access to courts; waiver of service of process requirements which would otherwise be applicable; waiver of the right to a jury trial and provisions otherwise purporting to affect the jurisdiction and venue of courts; (vi) choice-of-law provisions; (vii) provisions regarding arbitration; (viii) covenants not to compete; (ix) provisions that authorize you to set off and apply any deposits at any time held, and any other indebtedness at any time owing, by you to or for the account of the Borrowers, or (x) requirements in the Credit Agreement specifying that provisions thereof may only be waived in writing. Except as expressly otherwise set forth in this letter, our advice on every legal issue addressed in this letter is based exclusively on the internal laws of the State of New York or the Federal law of the United States which, in each case, in our experience is generally applicable both to general business organizations which are not engaged in regulated business activities and to transactions of the type contemplated in the Credit Agreement, on the one hand, and you, on the other hand (but without our having made any special investigation as to any other laws), except that we express no opinion or advice as to any law or legal issue (a) which might be violated by any misrepresentation or omission or a fraudulent act, or (b) to which any Borrower may be subject as a result of your legal or regulatory status, your sale or transfer of the Loans or interests therein or your involvement in the transactions contemplated by the Credit Agreement. None of the opinions or other advice contained in this letter considers or covers: (i) any federal or state securities (or blue sky laws or regulations or Federal Reserve Board margin regulations or (ii) federal or state antitrust and unfair competition laws and regulations, pension 

H- 5 
 and employee benefit laws and regulations, compliance with fiduciary duty requirements, federal and state environmental, land use and subdivision, tax, racketeering (e.g., RICO), health and safety (e.g., OSHA), and labor laws and regulations, federal and state laws, regulations and policies concerning national and local emergency, possible judicial deference to acts of sovereign states and criminal and civil forfeiture laws, and other federal and state statutes of general application to the extent they provide for criminal prosecution (e.g., mail fraud and wire fraud statutes). We also express no opinion regarding any laws relating to terrorism or money laundering, including Executive Order No. 13224, 66 Fed. Reg. 49079 (published September 25, 2001) (the Terrorism Executive Order or any related enabling legislation or any other similar executive order (collectively with the Terrorism Executive Order, the Executive Orders ), the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (Public Law 107-56, the Patriot Act ), any sanctions and regulations promulgated under authority granted by the Trading with the Enemy Act, 50 U.S.C.

L. No. 106-120, as amended from time to time. We express no opinion as to what law might be applied by any other courts to resolve any issue addressed in this letter. We advise you that issues addressed by this letter may be governed in whole or in part by other laws, but we express no opinion as to whether any relevant difference exists between the laws upon which our opinions are based and any other laws which may actually govern. This opinion letter speaks as of the time of its delivery on the date it bears. We do not assume any obligation to provide you with any subsequent opinion or advice by reason of any fact about which our Designated Transaction Lawyers did not have actual knowledge at that time, by reason of any change subsequent to that time in any law covered by any of our opinions, or for any other reason.

 You may rely upon this letter only for the purpose served by the provision in the Credit Agreement cited in the second paragraph of this opinion letter in response to which it has been delivered. Without our written consent: (i) no person other than you may rely on this opinion letter for any purpose; (ii) this opinion letter may not be cited or quoted in any financial statement, prospectus, private placement memorandum or other similar document; (iii) this opinion letter may not be cited or quoted in any other document or communication which might encourage reliance upon this opinion letter by any person or for any purpose excluded by the restrictions in this paragraph; and (iv) copies of this opinion letter may not be furnished to anyone for purposes of encouraging such reliance.

 1.4 Interest Rates; LIBOR Notification . The interest rate on Eurocurrency Loans denominated in Dollars and certain Foreign Currencies may be derived from an interest rate benchmark that is, or may in the future become, the subject of regulatory reform. Regulators have signaled the need to use alternative benchmark reference rates for some of these interest rate benchmarks and, as a result, such interest rate benchmarks may cease to comply with applicable laws and regulations, may be permanently discontinued, and/or the basis on which they are calculated may change. The London interbank offered rate is intended to represent the rate at which contributing banks may obtain short-term borrowings from each other in the London interbank market. In July 2017, the U.K. Financial Conduct 

29 

Authority announced that, after the end of 2021, it would no longer persuade or compel contributing banks to make rate submissions to the ICE Benchmark Administration (together with any successor to the ICE Benchmark Administrator, the IBA for purposes of the IBA setting the London interbank offered rate. As a result, it is possible that commencing in 2022, the London interbank offered rate may no longer be available or may no longer be deemed an appropriate reference rate upon which to determine the interest rate on Eurocurrency Loans. In light of this eventuality, public and private sector industry initiatives are currently underway to identify new or alternative reference rates to be used in place of the London interbank offered rate. Upon the occurrence of a Benchmark Transition Event, a Term SOFR Transition Event or an Early Opt-In Election with respect to any applicable Currency, subsection 2.11(b) and (c) provide a mechanism for determining an alternative rate of interest. The Administrative Agent will promptly notify the Borrower, pursuant to subsection 2.11(e), of any change to the reference rate upon which the interest rate on Eurocurrency Loans is based. However, the Administrative Agent does not warrant or accept any responsibility for, and shall not have any liability with respect to, the administration, submission or any other matter related to Daily Simple SONIA, the London interbank offered rate or other rates in the definition of Eurocurrency Rate or with respect to any alternative or successor rate thereto, or replacement rate thereof (including, without limitation, (i) any such alternative, successor or replacement rate implemented pursuant to subsection 2.11(b) or (c), whether upon the occurrence of a Benchmark Transition Event, a Term SOFR Transition Event or an Early Opt-in Election, and (ii) the implementation of any Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes pursuant to subsection 2.11(d)), including without limitation, whether the composition or characteristics of any such alternative, successor or replacement reference rate for any Currency will be similar to, or produce the same value or economic equivalence of, Adjusted Daily Simple SONIA, the Eurocurrency Rate or applicable Screen Rate for Loans denominated in such Currency or have the same volume or liquidity as did the London interbank offered rate (or the euro interbank offered rate, as applicable) prior to its discontinuance or unavailability. The Administrative Agent and its affiliates and/or other related entities may engage in transactions that affect the calculation of Adjusted Daily Simple SONIA, any alternative, successor or alternative rate (including any Benchmark Replacement) and/or any relevant adjustments thereto, in each case, in a manner adverse to the Borrowers. The Administrative Agent may select information sources or services in its reasonable discretion to ascertain SONIA or Daily Simple SONIA, any component thereof, or rates referenced in the definition thereof, in each case pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, and shall have no liability to the Borrowers, any Bank or any other person or entity for damages of any kind, including direct or indirect, special, punitive, incidental or consequential damages, costs, losses or expenses (whether in tort, contract or otherwise and whether at law or in equity), for any error or calculation of any such rate (or component thereof) provided by any such information source or service.

Until the notice given pursuant to the first sentence of this paragraph has been withdrawn by the Administrative Agent or the Foreign Currency Agent, as applicable, no further

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, if a Benchmark Transition Event or an Early Opt-in Election, as applicable, and its related Benchmark Replacement Date have occurred prior to the Reference Time in respect of any setting of the then-current Benchmark with respect to a Loan denominated in any Currency, then (x) if a Benchmark Replacement for a Loan denominated in such Currency is determined in accordance with clause (1) or (2) of the definition of Benchmark Replacement for such Benchmark Replacement Date, such Benchmark Replacement will replace such Benchmark for a Loan denominated in such Currency for all purposes hereunder and under any Loan Document in respect of such Benchmark setting and subsequent Benchmark settings without any amendment to, or further action or consent of any other party to, this Agreement or any other Loan Document and (y) if a Benchmark Replacement for a Loan denominated in such Currency is determined in accordance with clause (3) of the definition of Benchmark Replacement for such Benchmark Replacement Date such Benchmark Replacement will replace such Benchmark for all purposes hereunder and under any Loan Document in respect of any Benchmark setting at or after 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the fifth (5th) Business Day after the date notice of such Benchmark Replacement is provided to the Banks without any amendment to, or further action or consent of any other party to, this Agreement or any other Loan Document so long as the Administrative Agent has not received, by such time, written notice of objection to such Benchmark Replacement from Banks comprising the Majority Banks. (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document and subject to the proviso below in this paragraph, solely with respect to a Loan denominated in Dollars, if a Term SOFR Transition Event and its related Benchmark Replacement Date have occurred prior to the Reference Time in respect of any setting of the then-current Benchmark, then the applicable Benchmark Replacement will replace the then-current Benchmark for all purposes hereunder or under any Loan Document in respect of such Benchmark setting and subsequent Benchmark settings, without any amendment to, or further action or consent of any other party to, this Agreement or any other Loan Document; provided that, this clause (c) shall not be effective unless the Administrative Agent has delivered to the Banks and the Company a Term SOFR Notice.

40 

made in its or their sole discretion and without consent from any other party hereto or any other Loan Document, except, in each case, as expressly required pursuant to this subsection 2.11. (f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, at any time (including in connection with the implementation of a Benchmark Replacement), (i) if the then-current Benchmark is a term rate (including Term SOFR or Eurocurrency Rate) and either (A) any tenor for such Benchmark is not displayed on a screen or other information service that publishes such rate from time to time as selected by the Administrative Agent in its reasonable discretion or (B) the regulatory supervisor for the administrator of such Benchmark has provided a public statement or publication of information announcing that any tenor for such Benchmark is or will be no longer representative, then the Administrative Agent may modify the definition of Interest Period for any Benchmark settings at or after such time to remove such unavailable or non-representative tenor and (ii) if a tenor that was removed pursuant to clause (i) above either (A) is subsequently displayed on a screen or information service for a Benchmark (including a Benchmark Replacement) or (B) is not, or is no longer, subject to an announcement that it is or will no longer be representative for a Benchmark (including a Benchmark Replacement), then the Administrative Agent shall modify the definition of Interest Period for all Benchmark settings at or after such time to reinstate such previously removed tenor. (g) Upon the Company s receipt of notice of the commencement of a Benchmark Unavailability Period with respect to the Relevant Rate applicable to any Eurocurrency Loan , and or SONIA Loan, as applicable, and, with respect to such Eurocurrency Loans, during the continuance thereof (in each case below, to the extent such Benchmark Unavailability Period is in respect of the Relevant Rate applicable to such Eurocurrency Loan or such SONIA Loan, as applicable ), (i) a Borrower may revoke any request for a Eurocurrency Loan or SONIA Loan to be made during such Benchmark Unavailability Period, and, failing that, the applicable Borrower will be deemed to have converted such request for a Eurocurrency Loan denominated in Dollars into a request for an ABR Loan and (ii) any request for a Eurocurrency Loan denominated in a Foreign Currency or a SONIA Loan shall be ineffective. During any Benchmark Unavailability Period or at any time that a tenor for the then-current Benchmark is not an Available Tenor, the component of ABR based upon the then-current Benchmark or such tenor for such Benchmark, as applicable, will not be used in any determination of ABR. Furthermore, if any Eurocurrency Loan in any Currency or SONIA Loan is outstanding on the date of the Company s receipt of notice of the commencement of a Benchmark Unavailability Period with respect to the Relevant Rate applicable to such Eurocurrency Loan or SONIA Loan, as applicable , then (i) if such Eurocurrency Loan is denominated in Dollars, on the last day of the Interest Period applicable to such Loan (or the next succeeding Business Day if such day is not a Business Day), such Loan shall be converted by the Administrative Agent to, and shall constitute, an ABR Loan denominated in Dollars on such day or , ii) if such Eurocurrency Loan is denominated in any Foreign Currency, such Loan shall, on the last day of the Interest Period applicable to such Loan (or the next succeeding Business Day if such day is not a Business Day), at the applicable Borrower s election prior to such day: (A) be prepaid by the applicable Borrower on such day or (B) be converted by the Administrative Agent to, and shall constitute, an ABR Loan denominated in Dollars (in an amount equal to the Dollar Equivalent of the amount of such Eurocurrency Loan on such day (it being understood and agreed that if the applicable Borrower does not so prepay such Loan on such day by 12:00 noon, Local Time, the Administrative Agent is authorized to effect such conversion of such Eurocurrency Loan into an ABR Loan denominated in Dollars)); provided that, in the case of this subclause (B), upon any subsequent implementation of a Benchmark Replacement in respect of such Foreign Currency pursuant to this subsection 2.11, such ABR Loan denominated in Dollars shall then be converted by the Administrative Agent to, and shall constitute, a Eurocurrency Loan denominated in the original Foreign Currency applicable to such Loan (in an amount equal to the Foreign Currency Equivalent of the amount of such ABR Loan) on the day of, and after giving effect to, such implementation . or (iii) such SONIA Loan shall bear interest at the Central Bank Rate for Pounds Sterling plus the CBR Spread; provided that, if the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall 

41 

be conclusive and binding absent manifest error) that the Central Bank Rate for Pounds Sterling cannot be determined, any outstanding affected SONIA Loans, at the Company s election, shall either (A) be converted into ABR Loans denominated in Dollars (in an amount equal to the Dollar Equivalent of Pounds Sterling) immediately or (B) be prepaid in full immediately. 2.12 Pro Rata Treatment and Payments . (a) All payments (including prepayments) to be made by the Borrowers on account of principal, interest and fees shall be made without defense, set-off or counterclaim and shall be made, in the case of fees and principal of, and interest on, Loans (other than Negotiated Rate Loans) at the Administrative Agent s office specified in subsection 10.2, in each case in the relevant Currency in which the Loan was made and in immediately available funds not later than 11:00 A.M. (Local Time) on the date due. The Administrative Agent shall distribute such payments to the Banks entitled thereto on the day of receipt in like funds as received, provided that the Administrative Agent shall have received such payments not later than 11:00 A.M. (Local Time). If the Administrative Agent shall distribute such payments to the Banks entitled thereto on a date after the date on which such payments were received prior to 11:00 A.M. (Local Time), the Administrative Agent shall pay to each such Bank on demand an amount equal to the product of (i) the daily average applicable Overnight Rate, times (ii) the amount of such Bank s share of such payment, times (iii) a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days that elapse from and including such date of receipt of payment by the Administrative Agent to but excluding the date on which such Bank s share of such payment shall have become immediately available to such Bank and the denominator of which is 360. All payments (including prepayments) to be made by the Borrowers on account of principal, interest and fees relating to Negotiated Rate Loans shall be made to the Bank with respect thereto on such terms, at such address and at such time as shall be mutually agreed upon between the relevant Borrower and the relevant Bank in lawful money of the United States of America on the date due. 
 (b) (i) Each borrowing by a Borrower of Committed Rate Loans and each payment of principal in respect of Committed Rate Loans (subject to the provisions of subsection 2.20(e)) shall be made in accordance with the following requirements: 
 (A) All borrowings of Committed Rate Loans and all principal payments in respect of such Loans, shall be made pro rata according to the respective Commitments of the Banks. 
 (B) As provided in clause (b)(ii) below, if any principal payment is made in respect of any Loans (other than Negotiated Rate Loans) on any day on which principal amounts are due and owing in respect of any Loans (other than Negotiated Rate Loans), such principal payment shall be applied to the Banks pro rata according to the respective amounts of principal due and owing to the Banks under this Agreement. 
 (ii) Except as provided in subsections 2.13, 2.16 and 2.17, each reduction of the Commitments shall be made pro rata among the Banks according to their respective Commitment Percentages. Each payment by the Borrowers under this Agreement or of any Loan (other than Negotiated Rate Loans) shall be applied, first , to any fees then due and owing pursuant to subsection 2.4, second , to interest then due and owing in respect of the Loans (other than Negotiated Rate Loans) and third , to principal then due and owing hereunder (other than principal due and owing under Negotiated Rate Loans) and under the Loans (other than Negotiated Rate Loans). Each payment made by the Company or the Capital Corporation under this Agreement relating to a Negotiated Rate Loan to the Bank with respect thereto shall be applied, first , to interest then due and owing in respect of such Negotiated Rate Loan and second , to principal then due and owing hereunder with respect to such Negotiated Rate Loan and under such Negotiated Rate Loan. Each payment (other than voluntary prepayments made when no principal payments are due and owing hereunder) by a Borrower on account of principal of and interest on the Loans (other than Negotiated Rate Loans) shall be made for the account of each Bank pro 

42 

rata according to the respective amounts of principal and interest due and owing to such Bank under this Agreement. Subject to the requirements of clause (i) of this paragraph (b), each payment by a Borrower on account of principal of the Loans (other than Negotiated Rate Loans) shall be applied, first , to such of its Committed Rate Loan borrowings as such Borrower may designate and, second , after all Committed Rate Loans shall have been paid in full, to all of its Absolute Rate Bid Loans or Index Rate Bid Loans made on the same Borrowing Date with the same Interest Period as such Borrower may designate, pro rata according to the respective amounts outstanding; provided , however , that prepayments made pursuant to subsection 2.13(a), (b) or (c), 2.16(c) or 2.17(b) shall be applied in accordance with such subsection. 
 (c) If any payment hereunder (other than payments on the Eurocurrency Loans and Index Rate Bid Loans) becomes due and payable on a day other than a Business Day, such payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day. If any payment on a Eurocurrency Loan or Index Rate Bid Loan becomes due and payable on a day other than a Working Day, the maturity thereof shall be extended to the next succeeding Working Day unless the result of such extension would be to extend such payment into another calendar month in which event such payment shall be made on the immediately preceding Working Day. With respect to any extension of the payment of principal pursuant to this subsection 2.12(c), interest thereon shall be payable at the then applicable rate during such extension. 
 (d) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have been notified in writing by any Bank prior to the date of the Committed Rate Loan, Committed Rate Loans, Bid Loan or Bid Loans to be made by such Bank (which notice shall be effective upon receipt) that such Bank will not make its pro rata share of the amount of the requested borrowing on such date available to the Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Bank has made such amount available to it on such date and the Administrative Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the relevant Borrower a corresponding amount. If a Bank shall make such amount available to the Administrative Agent on a date after such Borrowing Date, such Bank shall pay to the Administrative Agent on demand an amount equal to the product of (i) the daily average applicable Overnight Rate, times (ii) the amount of such Bank s pro rata share of such borrowing, times (iii) a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days that elapse from and including such Borrowing Date to but excluding the date on which such Bank s pro rata share of such borrowing shall have become immediately available to the Administrative Agent and the denominator of which is 360. A certificate of the Administrative Agent submitted to any Bank with respect to any amounts owing under this subsection 2.12(d) shall be conclusive, absent manifest error. If such Bank s pro rata share is not in fact made available to the Administrative Agent by such Bank within three Business Days of such Borrowing Date, the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to recover such amount, on demand, from the relevant Borrower with interest thereon at the rate equal to the product of (i) during the period from and including such Borrowing Date to the Business Day next following the date of such demand, the daily average applicable Overnight Rate, times a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days that elapse from and including such Borrowing Date to but excluding the Business Day next following the date of such demand and the denominator of which is 360 and (ii) thereafter, the interest rate or rates applicable to the Loan or Loans funded by the Administrative Agent on behalf of such Bank on such Borrowing Date, times a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days which elapse from and including the Business Day next following the date of such demand to but excluding the date such amount is recovered by the Administrative Agent from such Borrower and the denominator of which is 360. In the event any Bank s pro rata share of a borrowing is not made available to the Administrative Agent in accordance with this paragraph within three Business Days of the applicable Borrowing Date (i) such Bank shall, during the period from such Borrowing Date to the date such Bank makes its pro rata share of the applicable borrowing available, not accrue and shall not be entitled to receive any commitment fee under subsection 2.4 and (ii) each Borrower may exercise or pursue any other rights, remedies, powers and privileges against such Bank as are provided by law or by contract.

EXHIBIT G [FORM OF OPINION OF GENERAL COUNSEL TO THE COMPANY] [Closing Date] To each of the Banks parties to the Credit Agreement referred to below and to JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Administrative Agent Deere Company and John Deere Capital Corporation 364-Day Credit Agreement Ladies and Gentlemen: This opinion is furnished to you pursuant to subsection 4.1(c) of the 3,000,000,000 364-Day Credit Agreement dated as of March 29, 2021 (the Credit Agreement among Deere Company (the Company ), John Deere Capital Corporation (the Capital Corporation and, together with the Company, the U.S. Borrowers and John Deere Bank S.A., the Banks parties thereto, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Administrative Agent, Citibank, N.A., as Documentation Agent, and Bank of America, N.A., as Syndication Agent. Terms defined in the Credit Agreement and not otherwise defined in this opinion are used herein as defined in the Credit Agreement. I am General Counsel of the Company and have also acted as counsel for the Capital Corporation in this matter. I am familiar with the corporate history and organization of each U.S. Borrower and of its Subsidiaries and the proceedings relating to the authorization, execution and delivery by each U.S. Borrower of the Credit Agreement. In that connection I have examined or caused to have examined: 1. The Credit Agreement; 2. The documents furnished by each of the U.S. Borrowers pursuant to Section 4 of the Credit Agreement; 3. The Certificates of Incorporation of the U.S. Borrowers and all amendments thereto (the Charters 4. The bylaws of the U.S. Borrowers and all amendments thereto (the Bylaws and 5. Certificates of the Secretary of State of Delaware, each dated a recent date, attesting to the continued corporate existence and good standing of the U.S. Borrowers in that State. In addition, I have reviewed or caused to have reviewed such of the corporate proceedings of the U.S. Borrowers, and have examined or caused to have examined such documents, corporate records, and other instruments relating to the organization of the U.S. Borrowers and their respective Subsidiaries and such other agreements and instruments to which the U.S. Borrowers and their respective Subsidiaries are parties, as I consider necessary as a basis for the opinions hereinafter 

G- 2 
 expressed. I have assumed the due execution and delivery, pursuant to due authorization, of the Credit Agreement by the Banks, the Administrative Agent, the Syndication Agent, and the Documentation Agent, and the authenticity of all documents submitted to me as originals and the conformity to the original documents of all documents submitted to me as certified, conformed or photostatic or electronic copies. I am qualified to practice law in the State of Illinois and the State of Iowa and do not purport to be an expert on, and do not express any opinion herein concerning, any laws other than the laws of the State of Illinois and the State of Iowa, the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware and the Federal laws of the United States. Based upon the foregoing and upon such investigation as I have deemed necessary, I am of the following opinion: 1. Each of the Company and the Capital Corporation is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware and has the corporate power and authority to carry on its business as now being conducted and to own its properties. 2. The execution, delivery and performance by each U.S. Borrower of the Credit Agreement are within such U.S. Borrower s corporate powers, have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action, and do not (i) contravene, or constitute a default under the Charter or the Bylaws of such U.S. Borrower, any judgment, law, rule or regulation applicable to such U.S. Borrower, or any Contractual Obligation by which such U.S. Borrower is bound or (ii) result in the creation of any lien, charge or encumbrance upon any of its property or assets. The Credit Agreement has been duly executed and delivered on behalf of each U.S. Borrower. 3. No authorization, approval, or other action by, and no notice to or filing with, any governmental authority or regulatory body is required for the due execution, delivery and performance by each U.S. Borrower of the Credit Agreement. 4. There is no pending or, to the best of my knowledge, threatened action or proceeding against either U.S. Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries before any court, governmental agency or arbitrator which is likely to have a materially adverse effect upon the financial condition or operations of such U.S. Borrower and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole. A copy of this opinion letter may be delivered by any of you to any person that becomes a Bank in accordance with the provisions of the Credit Agreement. Any such person may rely on the opinions expressed above as if this opinion letter were addressed and delivered to such person on the date hereof. This opinion letter is rendered to you in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Credit Agreement. This opinion letter may not be relied upon by you or any person entitled to rely on this opinion pursuant to the preceding paragraph for any other purpose without my prior written consent.

EXHIBIT H [FORM OF ENFORCEABILITY OPINION OF SPECIAL NEW YORK COUNSEL TO THE BORROWERS] [Closing Date] To the Agent and each of the Banks under the Credit Agreement (referred to below) on the date hereof: Re: 3,000,000,000 364-Day Credit Agreement dated as of March 29, 2021, by and among Deere Company, a Delaware corporation (the Company ), John Deere Capital Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the Capital Corporation ), John Deere Bank S.A., a public limited company organized under the laws of Luxembourg JD Luxembourg , and together with the Company and the Capital Corporation, the Borrowers ), the financial institutions from time to time party thereto as lenders (the Lenders ), JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as the Administrative Agent for the Banks (in such capacity, the Agent and the other parties thereto (such credit agreement herein referred to as the Credit Agreement Ladies and Gentlemen: We are issuing this opinion letter in our capacity as counsel to and at the request of the Borrowers in respect of the Credit Agreement. The opinions expressed herein are being provided pursuant to Section 4.1(c) of the Credit Agreement. Capitalized terms used but not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings given to such terms in the Credit Agreement (with references herein to the Credit Agreement and each document defined therein meaning the Credit Agreement and each such document as executed and delivered on the date hereof). The Banks and the Agent are sometimes referred to in this opinion letter as you . In connection with the preparation of this letter, we have, among other things, reviewed executed counterparts of the Credit Agreement. Subject to the assumptions, qualifications, exclusions and other limitations which are identified in this opinion letter, we advise you, and with respect to each legal issue addressed in this opinion letter, it is our opinion, that (a) the Credit Agreement is a valid and binding obligation of each Borrower that is a party thereto and is enforceable against such Borrower in accordance with its terms and (b) the guarantee by the Capital Corporation pursuant to Section 2.27 of the Credit Agreement is a valid and binding obligation of the Capital Corporation and is enforceable against the Capital Corporation in accordance with its terms. With your consent, we have assumed for purposes of this letter and the opinions herein: 

H- 2 
 (a) that each document we have reviewed for purposes of this letter is accurate and complete, each such document that is an original is authentic, each such document that is a copy conforms to an authentic original, and all signatures on each such document are genuine, and that all natural persons who have signed any document have the legal capacity to do so; (b) that the Credit Agreement and every other agreement we have examined for purposes of this letter has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the parties thereto and constitutes a valid and binding obligation of each party to that document, enforceable against each such party in accordance with its respective terms and that each such party has satisfied all legal requirements that are applicable to such party to the extent necessary to entitle such party to enforce such agreement and that each party to the Credit Agreement is in good standing and duly incorporated or organized under the laws of its jurisdiction of organization except we do not assume in this paragraph (b) that the Credit Agreement is a valid and binding obligation enforceable in accordance with its terms against the Borrowers; (c) there are no agreements or understandings among the parties, written or oral (other than the Credit Agreement), and there is no usage of trade or course of prior dealing among the parties that would, in either case define, supplement or qualify the terms of the Credit Agreement; and (d) that the status of the Credit Agreement as legally valid and binding obligations of the parties is not affected by any (i) breaches of, or defaults under, agreements or instruments, (ii) violations of statutes, rules, regulations or court or governmental orders, or (iii) failures to obtain required consents, approvals or authorizations from, or make required registrations, declarations or filings with, governmental authorities. In preparing this letter, we have relied without any independent verification upon: (i) information contained in certificates obtained from governmental authorities; (ii) factual information represented to be true in the Credit Agreement; (iii) factual information provided to us in a support certificate signed by each of the Borrowers; and (iv) factual information we have obtained from such other sources as we have deemed reasonable; and we have examined the originals or copies certified to our satisfaction, of the Credit Agreement and other corporate records of the Borrowers as we deem necessary for or relevant to our opinions. We have assumed without investigation that the information upon which we have relied is accurate and does not omit disclosures necessary to prevent such information from being misleading. The terms knowledge , actual knowledge and aware whenever used in this letter with respect to our firm mean conscious awareness at the time this letter is delivered on the date it bears by the lawyers with Kirkland Ellis LLP at that time who spent substantial time representing the Borrower in connection with the Credit Agreement (herein called our Designated Transaction Lawyers ). Our opinion (an enforceability opinion in this letter that any particular contract is a valid and binding obligation or is enforceable in accordance with its terms is subject to: (i) applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization, moratorium and similar laws affecting creditors rights and remedies generally and judicially developed doctrines in this area such as substantive consolidation and equitable subordination; (ii) the effect of general principles of equity (regardless of whether enforcement is sought in a proceeding at law or in equity); (iii) an 

H- 3 
 implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing; and (iv) other commonly recognized statutory and judicial constraints on enforceability including statutes of limitations. General principles of equity include but are not limited to: principles limiting the availability of specific performance and injunctive relief; principles which limit the availability of a remedy under certain circumstances where another remedy has been elected; principles requiring reasonableness, good faith and fair dealing in the performance and enforcement of an agreement by the party seeking enforcement; principles which may permit a party to cure a material failure to perform its obligations; and principles affording equitable defenses such as waiver, laches and estoppel. Our enforceability opinion is also subject to the qualification that certain provisions of the Credit Agreement may not be enforceable in whole or in part, although the inclusion of such provisions does not render the Credit Agreement invalid, and the Credit Agreement and the law of the State of New York contain adequate remedial provisions for the practical realization of the rights and benefits afforded thereby. Our enforceability opinion is further subject to the effect of rules of law that may render guaranties or other similar instruments or agreements unenforceable under circumstances where your actions, failures to act or waivers, amendments or replacement of the Credit Agreement (i) so radically change the essential nature of the terms and conditions of the guaranteed obligations and the related transactions that, in effect, a new relationship has arisen between you and the Borrowers which is substantially and materially different from that presently contemplated by the Credit Agreement, (ii) release the primary obligor, or (iii) impair the guarantor s recourse against the primary obligor. We also express no opinion regarding the enforceability of any so-called fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer savings clauses and any similar provisions in the Credit Agreement to the extent such provisions purport to limit the amount of the obligations of any party or the right to contribution of any other party with respect to such obligations. We render no opinion regarding the validity, binding effect or enforceability of the Credit Agreement with respect to any Borrower to the extent the Credit Agreement involves any obligation (including any guaranty) of such Borrower with respect to any swap (as such term is defined in the Commodity Exchange Act) if such Borrower is not an eligible contract participant (as such term is defined in the Commodity Exchange Act) at the time such obligation is incurred by such Borrower. We render no opinion with regard to usury or other laws limiting or regulating the maximum amount of interest that may be charged, collected, received or contracted for other than the internal laws of the State of New York, and without limiting the foregoing, we expressly disclaim any opinion as to the usury or other such laws of any other jurisdiction (including laws of other states made applicable through principles of Federal preemption or otherwise) which may be applicable to the transactions contemplated by the Credit Agreement.
