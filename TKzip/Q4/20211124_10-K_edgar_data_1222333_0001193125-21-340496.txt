SPDR 
 Gold Trust (the Trust is an investment trust, formed on November 12, 2004 under New York law pursuant to a trust indenture (the Trust Indenture ). The Trust holds gold and from time to time issues SPDR 
 Gold Shares (the Shares in Baskets in exchange for deposits of gold and distributes gold in connection with redemptions of Baskets. A Basket equals a block of 100,000 Shares. The investment objective of the Trust is for the Shares to reflect the performance of the price of gold bullion, less the Trust s expenses. World Gold Trust Services, LLC WGTS is the sponsor of the Trust (the Sponsor ). BNY Mellon Asset Servicing, a division of The Bank of New York Mellon BNYM is the trustee of the Trust (the Trustee ). State Street Global Advisors Funds Distributors, LLC SSGA is the marketing agent of the Trust (the Marketing Agent ). HSBC Bank plc HSBC is the custodian of the Trust (the Custodian ). 

 The Sponsor of the registrant maintains an Internet website at www.spdrgoldshares.com, through which the registrant s annual reports on Form 10-K,
 quarterly reports on Form 10-Q,
 current reports on Form 8-K,
 and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), are made available free of charge after they have been filed or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC ). Additional information regarding the Trust may also be found on the SEC s EDGAR database at www.sec.gov. 
 Investment Objective 

The Shares are intended to offer investors an opportunity to participate in the gold market through an investment in securities. Historically, the logistics of buying, storing and insuring gold have constituted a barrier to entry for some institutional and retail investors. The ownership of the Shares is intended to overcome these barriers to entry. The logistics of storing and insuring gold are dealt with by the Custodian, and the related expenses are built into the price of the Shares. Therefore, the investor does not have any additional tasks or costs over and above those associated with investing in any other publicly traded security. 

 The Shares are intended to provide institutional and retail investors with a simple and cost-efficient means of gaining investment benefits similar to those of holding allocated gold bullion. The Shares offer an investment that is: 

Easily Accessible.

 Investors can access the gold market through a traditional brokerage account. The Sponsor believes that investors will be able to more effectively implement strategic and tactical asset allocation strategies that use gold by using the Shares instead of using the traditional means of purchasing, trading and holding gold. 

Relatively Cost Efficient.

 The Sponsor believes that, for many investors, transaction costs related to the Shares will be lower than those associated with the purchase, storage and insurance of allocated gold. 

Exchange Traded.

 The Shares trade on NYSE Arca, Inc. NYSE Arca providing investors with an efficient means to buy, sell, or sell short in order to implement a variety of investment strategies. The Shares are eligible for margin accounts. The Shares are also listed on the Mexican Stock Exchange (Bolsa Mexicana de Valores), the Singapore Exchange Limited, the Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited and the Tokyo Stock Exchange. 

Backed by Gold Held by the Custodian on Behalf of the Trust.

 The Shares are backed by the assets of the Trust and the Trust does not hold or employ any derivative securities. Further, the Trust s holdings and their value based on current market prices are reported on the Trust s website each business day. The Trustee s arrangements with the Custodian provide that at the end of each business day there can be in the Trust account maintained by the Custodian no gold in an unallocated form. Accordingly, the Trust s gold holdings are identified on the Custodian s books as the property of the Trust and held in London. 

1 

Table of Contents 
 Overview 

The Shares represent units of fractional undivided beneficial interest in and ownership of the Trust. The Trust is not managed like a corporation or an active investment vehicle. The gold held by the Trust will only be sold: (1) on an as-needed
 basis to pay Trust expenses, (2) in the event the Trust terminates and liquidates its assets, or (3) as otherwise required by law or regulation. The sale of gold by the Trust is a taxable event to shareholders of the Trust Shareholders ). See United States Federal Tax Consequences Taxation of U.S. Shareholders. 
 The Trust is not registered as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940 and is not required to register under such act. The Trust will not hold or trade in commodity futures contracts regulated by the Commodity Exchange Act of 1936 (the CEA as administered by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (the CFTC ). The Trust is not a commodity pool for purposes of the CEA, and none of the Sponsor, the Trustee or the Marketing Agent is subject to regulation as a commodity pool operator or a commodity trading advisor in connection with the Shares. 

 The Trust creates and redeems Shares from time to time, but only in Baskets. The number of outstanding Shares changes from time to time as a result of the creation and redemption of Baskets. The creation and redemption of Baskets requires the delivery to the Trust or the distribution by the Trust of the amount of gold and any cash represented by the Baskets being created or redeemed. The total amount of gold and any cash required for the creation of Baskets is based on the combined net asset value (the NAV of the number of Baskets being created or redeemed. The number of ounces of gold required to create a Basket or to be delivered upon the redemption of a Basket will continue to gradually decrease over time. This is because the Shares comprising a Basket will represent a decreasing amount of gold due to the sale of the Trust s gold to pay the Trust s expenses. 

 Baskets may be created or redeemed only by Authorized Participants. An Authorized Participant is a person who: (1) is a registered broker-dealer or other securities market participant such as a bank or other financial institution which is not required to register as a broker-dealer to engage in securities transactions; (2) is a participant in the Depository Trust Company system DTC (3) has entered into an agreement with the Sponsor and the Trustee which provides the procedures for the creation and redemption of Baskets and for the delivery of the gold and any cash required for such creations and redemptions, or a Participant Agreement; and (4) has established an unallocated gold account with the Custodian Authorized Participant Unallocated Account ). Authorized Participants pay a transaction fee of 2,000 for each order to create or redeem Baskets. Authorized Participants may sell to other investors all or part of the Shares included in the Baskets they purchase from the Trust. 

 The ICE Benchmark Administration Limited (the IBA provides the auction platform and methodology as well as the overall independent administration and governance for the LBMA Gold Price. In determining the NAV of the Trust, the Trustee values the gold held by the Trust on the basis of the price of an ounce of gold determined by the IBA 3:00 PM auction process LBMA Gold Price PM ), which is an electronic auction, with the imbalance calculated, and the price adjusted in rounds (30 seconds in duration). The auction runs twice daily at 10:30 AM and 3:00 PM London time. 

 The Trustee determines the NAV of the Trust on each day the NYSE Arca is open for regular trading, at the earlier of the LBMA Gold Price PM for the day or 12:00 PM New York time. If no LBMA Gold Price PM is announced on a particular evaluation day or if the LBMA Gold Price PM has not been announced by 12:00 PM New York time on a particular evaluation day, the next most recent LBMA Gold Price (AM or PM) is used in the determination of the NAV of the Trust, unless the Trustee, in consultation with the Sponsor, determines that such price is inappropriate to use as the basis for such determination. In the event the Trustee and the Sponsor determine that such price is not an appropriate basis for valuation of the Trust s gold, they will identify an alternative basis for such valuation to be employed by the Trustee. 

 To determine the Trust s NAV, the Trustee subtracts all estimated accrued fees, expenses and other liabilities of the Trust from the total value of the gold and all other assets of the Trust.

Table of Contents 
 The Trust s assets only consist of allocated gold bullion and gold receivable when recorded; representing gold covered by contractually binding orders for the creation of Shares where the gold has not yet been transferred to the Trust s account and, from time to time, cash, which will be used to pay expenses. Cash held by the Trust will not generate any income. The Trust does not hold any derivative instruments. Each Share represents a proportional interest, based on the total number of Shares outstanding, in the gold and any cash held by the Trust, less the Trust s liabilities (which include accrued expenses). While the secondary market trading price of the Shares has fluctuated in response to the price of gold, the Sponsor believes that the trading price of the Shares reflects the estimated accrued expenses of the Trust. 

 Sales of Gold 

The Trustee, at the direction of the Sponsor or in its own discretion, sells the Trust s gold as necessary to pay the Trust s expenses. As a result, the amount of gold sold will vary from time to time depending on the level of the Trust s expenses and the market price of gold. Unless otherwise directed by the Sponsor, the Trustee will sell gold to the Custodian at the next LBMA Gold Price PM following the sale order. Neither the Trustee nor the Sponsor is liable for depreciation or loss incurred by reason of any sale. See United States Federal Tax Consequences Taxation of U.S. Shareholders for information on the tax treatment of gold sales. 

 The Trustee may also sell the Trust s gold if the Sponsor notifies the Trustee that the sale of gold is required by applicable law or regulation or in connection with the termination and liquidation of the Trust. The Trustee will not be liable or responsible in any way for depreciation or loss incurred by reason of any sale of gold directed by the Sponsor. Any property received by the Trust other than gold, cash or an amount receivable in cash (such as, for example, an insurance claim) will be promptly sold or otherwise disposed of by the Trustee. 

 Gold Price Information 

Investors may obtain on a 24-hour
 basis gold pricing information based on the spot price for an ounce of gold from various financial information service providers. Current spot prices are also generally available with bid/ask spreads from gold bullion dealers. In addition, the Trust s website provides ongoing pricing information for gold spot prices and the Shares. Market prices for the Shares are available from a variety of sources including brokerage firms, information websites and other information service providers. The NAV of the Trust is published by the Sponsor on each day that NYSE Arca is open for regular trading and is posted on the Trust s website at www.spdrgoldshares.com. 
 The Gold Industry 

Gold Supply and Demand 

Gold is a physical asset that is accumulated rather than consumed. As a result, virtually all the gold that has ever been mined still exists today in one form or another. The following table is a summary of the world gold supply and demand for the past 5 years. It is based on information reported in the Gold Focus 2021

Metals Focus Data Ltd., an affiliate of the Sponsor, provides the supply and demand data to Metals Focus, Ltd. When used in this prospectus tonne refers to one metric tonne, which is equivalent to 1,000 kilograms or 32,151 troy ounces.

Sources of Gold Supply 

Based on data from Gold Focus 2021

, gold supply averaged 4,777.8 tonnes per year between 2016 and 2020. Sources of gold supply include both mine production and recycled above-ground stocks and, to a lesser extent, producer net hedging. The largest portion of gold supplied to the market is from mine production, which averaged approximately 3,563 tonnes per year from 2016 through 2020. The second largest source of annual gold supply is recycling gold, which is gold that has been recovered from jewelry and other fabricated products and converted back into marketable gold. Recycled gold averaged approximately 1,205 tonnes annually between 2016 through 2020. 
 Sources of Gold Demand 

Based on data from Gold Focus 2021

, gold demand averaged 3,786 tonnes per year between 2016 and 2020. Gold demand generally comes from four sources: jewelry, industry (including medical applications), investment and the official sector (including central banks and supranational organizations). The largest source of demand comes from jewelry fabrication, which accounted for approximately 53 of the identifiable demand from 2016 through 2020 followed by net physical investment, which represents identifiable investment demand, which accounted for approximately 26 . 
 Gold demand is widely dispersed throughout the world with significant contributions from India and China. In many countries there are seasonal fluctuations in the levels of demand for gold especially jewelry. However, as a result of variations in the timing of seasons throughout the world, seasonal fluctuations in demand do not appear to have a significant impact on the global gold price. 

 Between 2016 and 2020, according to Gold Focus 2021

, central bank purchases averaged 460 tonnes. The prominence given by market commentators to this activity coupled with the total amount of gold held by the official sector has resulted in this area being one of the more visible shifts in the gold market. 
 Operation of the Gold Bullion Market 

The global trade in gold consists of over-the-counter

 OTC transactions in spot, forwards, and options and other derivatives, together with exchange-traded futures and options.

 Global Over-the-Counter

 Market 

The OTC market trades on a continuous basis and accounts for most global gold trading. Market makers and participants in the OTC market trade with each other and their clients on a principal-to-principal

 basis. All risks and issues of credit are between the parties directly involved in the transaction. The three products relevant to LBMA market making are Spot (S), Forwards (F) and Options (O). There are twelve LBMA Market Makers who provide the service in one, two or all three products. 2

The OTC market provides a relatively flexible market in term of quotes, price, size, destinations for delivery and other factors. Bullion dealers customize transactions to meet their clients requirements. The OTC market has no formal structure and no open-outcry meeting place. 

 The main centers of the OTC market are London, New York and Zurich. Mining companies, central banks, manufacturers of jewelry and industrial products, together with investors and speculators, tend to transact their business through one of these centers. Centers such as Dubai and several cities in the Far East also transact substantial OTC market business. Bullion dealers have offices around the world and most of the world s major bullion dealers are either members or associate members of the LBMA. 

 In the OTC market, the standard size of gold trades ranges between 5,000 and 10,000 ounces. Bid-offer
 spreads are typically 0.50 per ounce. Transaction costs in the OTC market are negotiable between the parties and therefore vary widely, with some dealers willing to offer clients competitive prices for larger volumes, although this will vary according to the dealer, the client and market conditions. Cost indicators can be obtained from various information service providers as well as dealers. 
 Liquidity in the OTC market can vary from time to time during the course of the 24-hour
 trading day. Fluctuations in liquidity are reflected in adjustments to dealing spreads the difference between a dealer s buy and sell prices. The period of greatest liquidity in the gold market generally occurs at the time of day when trading in the European time zones overlaps with trading in the United States, which is when OTC market trading in London, New York and other centers coincides with futures and options trading on the Commodity Exchange Inc. (the COMEX ). 
 The London Bullion Market 

Although the market for physical gold is global, most OTC market trades are cleared through London. In addition to coordinating market activities, the LBMA acts as the principal point of contact between the market and its regulators. A primary function of the LBMA is its involvement in the promotion of refining standards by maintenance of the London Good Delivery Lists, which are the lists of LBMA accredited melters and assayers of gold. The LBMA also coordinates market clearing and vaulting, promotes good trading practices and develops standard documentation.

 The term loco London refers to gold bars physically held in London that meet the specifications for weight, dimensions, fineness (or purity), identifying marks (including the assay stamp of an LBMA acceptable refiner) and appearance set forth in The Good Delivery Rules for Gold and Silver Bars published by the LBMA. Gold bars meeting these requirements are known as London Good Delivery Bars. The unit of trade in London is the troy ounce, whose conversion between grams is: 1,000 grams = 32.1507465 troy ounces and 1 troy ounce = 31.1034768 grams. A London Good Delivery Bar is acceptable for delivery in settlement of a transaction on the OTC market. Typically referred to as 400-
 ounce bars, a London Good Delivery Bar must contain between 350 and 430 fine troy ounces of gold, with a minimum fineness (or purity) of 995 parts per 1,000 (99.5 ), be of good appearance and be easy to handle and stack. The fine gold content of a gold bar is calculated by multiplying the gross weight of the bar (expressed in units of 0.025 troy ounces) by the fineness of the bar. 
 LBMA Gold Price 

The LBMA Gold Price is determined twice daily during London trading hours through an auction which provides reference gold prices for that day s trading. The LBMA Gold Price was initiated on March 20, 2015 and replaced the London PM Gold Fix. The auction that determines the LBMA Gold Price is a physically settled, electronic and tradeable auction, with the ability to settle trades in U.S. dollars, euros or British pounds. The IBA provides the auction platform and methodology as well as the overall administration and governance for the LBMA Gold Price. Many long-term contracts are expected to be priced on the basis of either the morning (AM) or afternoon (PM) LBMA Gold Price, and many market participants are expected to refer to one or the other of these prices when looking for a basis for valuations. 

 The Financial Conduct Authority (the FCA in the U.K. regulates the LBMA Gold Price. 

 Futures Exchanges 

The most significant gold futures exchange is the COMEX, part of the CME Group. It began to offer trading in gold futures contracts in 1974, and for most of the period since that date, it has been the largest exchange in the world for trading precious metals futures and options. The Tokyo Commodity Exchange (the TOCOM is another significant futures exchange and has been trading gold since 1982. Trading on these exchanges is based on fixed delivery dates and transaction sizes for the futures and options contracts traded. Trading costs are negotiable. As a matter of practice, only a small percentage of the futures market turnover ever comes to physical delivery of the gold represented by the contracts traded. Both exchanges permit trading on margin. Margin trading can add to the speculative risk involved given the potential for margin calls if the price moves against the contract holder. Both the COMEX and the TOCOM operate through a central clearance system, and in each case, the exchange acts as a counterparty for each member for clearing purposes. 

 Over recent years China has become an important source of gold demand, and its futures markets have grown. Gold futures contracts are traded on the Shanghai Gold Exchange and the Shanghai Futures Exchange. 

 Market Regulation 

The global gold markets are overseen and regulated by both governmental and self-regulatory organizations. In addition, certain trade associations have established rules and protocols for market practices and participants.

 Movements in the Price of Gold 

The following chart provides historical background on the price of gold. The chart illustrates movements in the price of gold in U.S. dollars per ounce over the period from the day the Shares began trading on the NYSE on November 18, 2004 to September 30, 2021, and is based on the LBMA Gold Price PM when available from March 20, 2015 and previously the London PM Fix. 

Creation and Redemption of Shares 

The Trust creates and redeems Shares from time to time, but only in one or more Baskets. The creation and redemption of Baskets is only made in exchange for the delivery to the Trust or the distribution by the Trust of the amount of gold and any cash represented by the Baskets being created or redeemed, the amount of which is based on the combined NAV of the number of Shares included in the Baskets being created or redeemed determined on the day the order to create or redeem Baskets is properly received. Creations of Baskets may only be settled after the requisite gold is deposited in the allocated account of the Trust. 

 Authorized Participants are the only persons that may place orders to create and redeem Baskets. To become an Authorized Participant, a person must enter into a Participant Agreement with the Sponsor and the Trustee. The Participant Agreement and the related procedures attached thereto may be amended by the Trustee and the Sponsor without the consent of any Shareholder or Authorized Participant. Authorized Participants who make deposits with the Trust in exchange for Baskets receive no fees, commissions or other form of compensation or inducement of any kind from either the Sponsor or the Trust, and no such person has any obligation or responsibility to the Sponsor or the Trust to effect any sale or resale of Shares. 

 Some of the activities of Authorized Participants will result in their being deemed participants in a distribution in a manner which would render them statutory underwriters and subject them to the prospectus-delivery and liability provisions of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ). As of the date of this annual report, the Authorized Participants are Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC, Goldman, Sachs Co., Goldman Sachs Execution Clearing, L.P., HSBC Securities (USA) Inc., J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, Merrill Lynch Professional Clearing Corp., Morgan Stanley Co. LLC, RBC Capital Markets LLC, UBS Securities LLC and Virtu Americas LLC. An updated list of Authorized Participants can be obtained from the Trustee or the Sponsor. 

 Prior to initiating any creation or redemption order, an Authorized Participant must have entered into an agreement with the Custodian to establish an Authorized Participant Unallocated Account in London, or a Participant Unallocated Bullion Account Agreement. Authorized Participant Unallocated Accounts may only be used for transactions with the Trust. An unallocated account is an account with a bullion dealer, which may also be a bank, to which a fine weight amount of gold is credited. Transfers to or from an unallocated account are made by crediting or debiting the number of ounces of gold being deposited or withdrawn. The account holder is entitled to direct the bullion dealer to deliver an amount of physical gold equal to the amount of gold standing to

Table of Contents 
 the credit of the account holder. Gold held in an unallocated account is not segregated from the Custodian s assets. The account holder therefore has no ownership interest in any specific bars of gold that the bullion dealer holds or owns. The account holder is an unsecured creditor of the bullion dealer, and credits to an unallocated account are at risk of the bullion dealer s insolvency, in which event it may not be possible for a liquidator to identify any gold held in an unallocated account as belonging to the account holder rather than to the bullion dealer. 

 Certain Authorized Participants are able to participate directly in the gold bullion market and the gold futures market. In some cases, an Authorized Participant may from time to time acquire gold from or sell gold to its affiliated gold trading desk, which may profit in these instances. The Sponsor believes that the size and operation of the gold bullion market make it unlikely that an Authorized Participant s direct activities in the gold or securities markets will impact the price of gold or the price of the Shares. Authorized Participants must be: (1) a DTC Participant; (2) registered as a broker-dealer under the Exchange Act, and regulated by FINRA, or some other self-regulatory organization or will be exempt from being or otherwise not be required to be so regulated or registered; and (3) qualified to act as a broker or dealer in the states or other jurisdictions where the nature of its business so requires. Each Authorized Participant will have its own set of rules and procedures, internal controls and information barriers as it determines is appropriate in light of its own regulatory regime. 

 Authorized Participants may act for their own accounts or as agents for broker-dealers, custodians and other securities market participants that wish to create or redeem Baskets. An order for one or more Baskets may be placed by an Authorized Participant on behalf of multiple clients. Persons interested in purchasing Baskets should contact the Sponsor or the Trustee to obtain the contact information for the Authorized Participants. Shareholders who are not Authorized Participants will only be able to redeem their Shares through an Authorized Participant. 

 All gold bullion must be delivered to the Trust and distributed by the Trust in unallocated form through credits and debits between Authorized Participant Unallocated Accounts and the Trust Unallocated Account. 

 All gold bullion must be of at least a minimum fineness (or purity) of 995 parts per 1,000 (99.5 and otherwise conform to the rules, regulations, practices and customs of the LBMA, including the specifications for a London Good Delivery Bar. 

 Under the Participant Agreement, the Sponsor has agreed to indemnify the Authorized Participants against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act, and to contribute to the payments the Authorized Participants may be required to make in respect of those liabilities. The Trustee has agreed to reimburse the Authorized Participants, solely from and to the extent of the Trust s assets, for indemnification and contribution amounts due from the Sponsor to the extent the Sponsor has not paid such amounts when due. 

 The following description of the procedures for the creation and redemption of Baskets is only a summary and investors should review the description of the procedures for the creation and redemption of Baskets set forth in the Trust Indenture, the form of Participant Agreement and the form of Participant Unallocated Bullion Account Agreement, each of which has been filed as an exhibit to this report. 

 Creation Procedures 

On any business day, an Authorized Participant may place an order with the Trustee to create one or more Baskets. Purchase orders must be placed by 4:00 PM or the close of regular trading on NYSE Arca, whichever is earlier. The day on which the Trustee receives a valid purchase order is the purchase order date. 

 By placing a purchase order, an Authorized Participant agrees to deposit gold with the Trust, or a combination of gold and cash, as described below. Prior to the delivery of Baskets for a purchase order, the Authorized Participant must also have wired to the Trustee the non-refundable
 transaction fee due for the purchase order.

Table of Contents 
 Determination of Required Deposits 

The total deposit required to create each Basket is an amount of gold and cash, if any, that is in the same proportion to the total assets of the Trust (net of estimated accrued expenses and other liabilities) on the date the order to purchase is properly received as the number of Shares to be created under the purchase order is in proportion to the total number of Shares outstanding on the date the order is received. 

 Delivery of Required Deposits 

An Authorized Participant who places a purchase order is responsible for crediting its Authorized Participant Unallocated Account with the required gold deposit amount by the end of the second business day in London following the purchase order date. The Custodian, after receiving appropriate instructions from the Authorized Participant and the Trustee, will transfer on the second business day following the purchase order date the gold deposit amount by debiting such amount from the Authorized Participant Unallocated Account and by crediting such amount to the Trust Unallocated Account and by delivery of the gold to the Trust Allocated Account. The expense and risk of delivery, ownership and safekeeping of gold until such gold has been received by the Trust will be borne solely by the Authorized Participant. If gold is to be delivered other than as described above, the Sponsor is authorized to establish such procedures and to appoint such custodians and establish such custody accounts as the Sponsor determines to be desirable. 

 Acting on standing instructions given by the Trustee, the Custodian will transfer the gold deposit amount from the Trust Unallocated Account to the Trust Allocated Account on the second business day following the purchase order date by allocating to the Trust Allocated Account specific bars of gold from unallocated bars which the Custodian holds or instructing a subcustodian to allocate specific bars of gold from unallocated bars held by or for the subcustodian. The gold bars in an allocated gold account are specific to that account and are identified by a list which shows, for each gold bar, the refiner, assay or fineness, serial number and gross and fine weight. Gold held in the Trust s allocated account is the property of the Trust and is not traded, leased or loaned under any circumstances. 

 The Custodian will transfer the gold deposit amount from the Trust Unallocated Account to the Trust Allocated Account by 2:00 PM (London time) unless the Custodian is required to use a subcustodian in the allocation process, in which event the Custodian will use its best efforts to complete the transfer by 2:00 PM (London time). Upon Trustee s receipt of confirmation from the Custodian that the gold deposit amount has been transferred from the Trust Unallocated Account to the Trust Allocated Account, the Trustee will direct DTC to credit the number of Baskets ordered by the Authorized Participant to the Authorized Participant s DTC account. During the period of the transfer, all Shareholders will be exposed to the risks of unallocated gold to the extent of that gold deposit amount until the Custodian completes the allocation process. 

 Redemption Procedures 

The procedures by which an Authorized Participant can redeem one or more Baskets mirror the procedures for the creation of Baskets. On any business day, an Authorized Participant may place an order with the Trustee to redeem one or more Baskets. Redemption orders must be placed by 4:00 PM or the close of regular trading on NYSE Arca, whichever is earlier. A redemption order so received is effective on the date it is received in satisfactory form by the Trustee. 

 Determination of Redemption Distribution 

The redemption distribution from the Trust consists of a credit to the redeeming Authorized Participant s Authorized Participant Unallocated Account representing the amount of the gold held by the Trust evidenced by the Shares being redeemed plus, or minus, the cash redemption amount. The cash redemption amount is equal to the value of all assets of the Trust other than gold less all estimated accrued expenses and other liabilities, divided by the number of Baskets outstanding and multiplied by the number of Baskets included in the 

9 

Table of Contents 
 Authorized Participant s redemption order. The Sponsor anticipates that in the ordinary course of the Trust s operations there will be no cash distributions made to Authorized Participants upon redemptions. Fractions of a fine ounce of gold included in the redemption distribution smaller than 0.001 of a fine ounce are disregarded. Redemption distributions are subject to the deduction of any applicable tax or other governmental charges which may be due. 

 Delivery of Redemption Distribution 

The redemption distribution due from the Trust is delivered to the Authorized Participant on the second business day following the redemption order date if, by 9:00 AM New York time on such second business day, the Trustee s DTC account has been credited with the Baskets to be redeemed. If the Trustee s DTC account has not been credited with all of the Baskets to be redeemed by such time, the redemption distribution is delivered to the extent of whole Baskets received. Any remainder of the redemption distribution is delivered on the next business day to the extent of remaining whole Baskets received if the Trustee receives the fee applicable to the extension of the redemption distribution date which the Trustee may, from time to time, determine and the remaining Baskets to be redeemed are credited to the Trustee s DTC account by 9:00 AM New York time on such next business day. Any further outstanding amount of the redemption order may be cancelled. The Trustee is also authorized to deliver the redemption distribution notwithstanding that the Baskets to be redeemed are not credited to the Trustee s DTC account by 9:00 AM New York time on the second business day following the redemption order date if the Authorized Participant has collateralized its obligation to deliver the Baskets through DTC s book entry system on such terms as the Sponsor and the Trustee may from time to time agree upon. 

 The Custodian transfers the redemption gold amount from the Trust Allocated Account to the Trust Unallocated Account and, thereafter, to the redeeming Authorized Participant s Authorized Participant Unallocated Account. The Authorized Participant and the Trust are each at risk in respect of gold credited to their respective unallocated accounts in the event of the Custodian s insolvency. See Risk Factors Gold held in the Trust s unallocated gold account and any Authorized Participant s unallocated gold account will not be segregated from the Custodian s assets. 

 Suspension or Rejection of Redemption Orders 

The Trustee may, in its discretion, and will when directed by the Sponsor, suspend the right of redemption, or postpone the redemption settlement date for: (1) any period during which NYSE Arca is closed other than customary weekend or holiday closings, or trading on NYSE Arca is suspended or restricted; (2) any period during which an emergency exists as a result of which delivery, disposal or evaluation of gold is not reasonably practicable; or (3) such other period as the Sponsor determines to be necessary for the protection of the Shareholders. 

 The Trustee will reject a redemption order if: (1) the order is not in proper form as described in the Participant Agreement; (2) the fulfillment of the order, in the opinion of its counsel, might be unlawful; (3) the order would have adverse tax consequences to the Trust or its Shareholders; or (4) circumstances outside the control of the Trustee, the Sponsor or the Custodian make the redemption, for all practical purposes, not feasible to process. 

 None of the Sponsor, the Trustee or the Custodian will be liable to any person or in any way for any loss or damages that may result from any such suspension, postponement or rejection. 

 Creation and Redemption Transaction Fee 

An Authorized Participant is required to pay a transaction fee to the Trustee of 2,000 per order to create or redeem Baskets. An order may include multiple Baskets. The transaction fee may be changed by the Trustee with the consent of the Sponsor. The Trustee shall notify DTC of any agreement to change the transaction fee and will not implement any increase in the fee for the redemption of Baskets until 30 days after the date of the notice. A transaction fee may not exceed 0.10 of the value of a Basket at the time the creation and redemption order is accepted. 

10 

Table of Contents 
 Tax Responsibility 

Authorized Participants are responsible for any transfer tax, sales or use tax, recording tax, value added tax or similar tax or governmental charge applicable to the creation or redemption of Baskets, regardless of whether or not such tax or charge is imposed directly on the Authorized Participant, and agree to indemnify the Sponsor, the Trustee and the Trust if they are required by law to pay any such tax, together with any applicable penalties, additions to tax or interest thereon. 

 Trust Expenses 

The Trustee sells gold as needed to pay the expenses of the Trust. As a result, the amount of gold sold will vary from time to time depending on the level of the Trust s expenses and the market price of gold. Cash held by the Trustee does not bear any interest. The Trust s estimated ordinary operating expenses are accrued daily and reflected in the NAV of the Trust. 

 The Trust s only recurring fixed expense is the Sponsor s fee which accrues daily at an annual rate equal to 0.40 of the daily NAV. In exchange for the Sponsor s fee, the Sponsor agreed to pay all ordinary fees and expenses of the Trust which include fees and expenses of the Trustee, the fees and expenses of the Custodian for the custody of the Trust s gold bars, the fees and expenses of the Sponsor, certain taxes, the fees of the Marketing Agent, printing and mailing costs, legal and audit fees, registration fees, NYSE Arca listing fees and other marketing costs and expenses.

 gold bullion with conforming bullion as soon as practical. 
 The Trustee and the Custodian have entered into the Custody Agreements which establish the Trust Unallocated Account and the Trust Allocated Account. The Trust Unallocated Account is used to facilitate the transfer of gold deposits and gold redemption distributions between Authorized Participants and the Trust in connection with the creation and redemption of Baskets and the sales of gold made by the Trustee for the Trust. Except when gold is transferred in and out of the Trust, all gold deposited with the Trust is held in the Trust Allocated Account. 

 The Custodian is authorized to appoint from time to time one or more subcustodians to hold the Trust s gold until it can be transported to the Custodian s vault. The subcustodians that the Custodian may utilize are the Bank of England, The Bank of Nova Scotia-ScotiaMocatta, ICBC Standard Bank Plc, JPMorgan Chase Bank and UBS AG. During the year ended September 30, 2021, no gold was held by a subcustodian. 

 In accordance with LBMA practices and customs, the Custodian does not have written custody agreements with the subcustodians it selects. The Custodian s selected subcustodians may appoint further subcustodians. These further subcustodians are not expected to have written custody agreements with the Custodian s subcustodians that selected them. The lack of such written contracts could affect the recourse of the Trust and the Custodian against any subcustodian in the event a subcustodian does not use due care in the safekeeping of the Trust s gold. See Risk Factors The ability of the Trustee and the Custodian to take legal action against subcustodians may be limited. 

 The Custodian is required to use reasonable care in selecting subcustodians, but otherwise has limited responsibility in relation to the subcustodians appointed by it. The Custodian is obliged under the Allocated Bullion Account Agreement to use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain delivery of gold from those subcustodians appointed by it. However, the Custodian may not have the right to, and does not have the obligation to, seek recovery of the gold from any subcustodian appointed by a subcustodian. Otherwise, the Custodian does not undertake to monitor the performance by subcustodians of their custody functions or their selection of additional subcustodians and is not responsible for the actions or inactions of subcustodians. Since August 13, 2020, the Custodian has not utilized any subcustodians on behalf of the Trust. 

 Under the customs and practices of the London bullion market, allocated gold is held by custodians and, on their behalf, by subcustodians under arrangements that permit each entity for which gold is being held: (1) to request from the entity s custodian (and a custodian or subcustodian to request from its subcustodian) a list identifying each gold bar being held and the identity of the particular custodian or subcustodian holding the gold bar and 

15 

Table of Contents 
 (2) to request the entity s custodian to release the entity s gold within two business days following demand for release. Each custodian or subcustodian is obligated under the customs and practices of the London bullion market to provide the bar list and the identification of custodians and subcustodians referred to in (1) above, and each custodian is obligated to release gold as requested. Under English law, unless otherwise provided in any applicable custody agreement, a custodian generally is liable to its customer for failing to take reasonable care of the customer s gold and for failing to release the customer s gold upon demand. The Custodian will not be liable for the acts or omissions, or for the solvency, of any subcustodian that it selects unless the selection of that subcustodian was made negligently or in bad faith. 

 The Custodian and the Trustee do not require any direct or indirect subcustodians to be insured or bonded with respect to their custodial activities. The Custodian maintains insurance with regard to its business on such terms and conditions as it considers appropriate. The Trustee and the Sponsor (so long as the Sponsor is WGTS) may, subject to confidentiality restrictions, review this insurance coverage. The Trust will not be a beneficiary of any such insurance and does not have the ability to dictate the existence, nature or amount of the coverage. Therefore, Shareholders cannot be assured that the Custodian maintains adequate insurance or any insurance with respect to the gold held by the Custodian on behalf of the Trust. 

 Description of the Custody Agreements 

The Allocated Bullion Account Agreement and the Unallocated Bullion Account Agreement between the Trustee and the Custodian establish the Trust Allocated Account and the Trust Unallocated Account, respectively. These agreements, as amended, restated, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, are sometimes referred to together as the Custody Agreements in this report. The following is a description of the material terms of the Custody Agreements. As the Custody Agreements are similar in form, they are discussed together, with material distinctions between the agreements noted. 

 Reports 

The Custodian provides the Trustee with reports for each business day, identifying the movements of gold in and out of the Trust Allocated Account and the credits and debits of gold to the Trust Unallocated Account. The Custodian also provides the Trustee with monthly statements of account for the Trust Allocated Account and the Trust Unallocated Account as of the last business day of each month. The monthly statements contain sufficient information to identify each bar of gold held in the Trust Allocated Account and, if the bar is being held temporarily by a subcustodian, the identity of the subcustodian having custody. 

 Transfers into the Trust Unallocated Account 

The Custodian credits to the Trust Unallocated Account the amount of gold it receives from the Trust Allocated Account, an Authorized Participant Unallocated Account or from other third-party unallocated accounts for credit to the Trust Unallocated Account. Unless otherwise agreed by the Custodian in writing, the only gold the Custodian will accept in physical form for credit to the Trust Unallocated Account is gold the Trustee has transferred from the Trust Allocated Account. No interest will be paid by the Custodian on any credit balance to the Trust Unallocated Account. 

 Transfers from the Trust Unallocated Account 

The Custodian transfers gold from the Trust Unallocated Account only in accordance with the Trustee s instructions to the Custodian. A transfer of gold from the Trust Unallocated Account may only be made, (1) by transferring gold to a third party unallocated account; (2) by transferring gold to the Trust Allocated Account; or (3) by either (A) making gold available for collection at the Custodian s vault premises or at such other location as the Custodian may specify; or (B), if separately agreed, delivering the gold to such location as the Custodian and the Trustee agree at the Trust s expense and risk. Any gold made available will be in a physical form which complies with the rules, regulations, practices and customs of the LBMA, the Bank of England or any applicable regulatory body, or Custody Rules, or in such other form as may be agreed between the Trustee and the Custodian, and in all cases will comprise one or more whole gold bars selected by the Custodian. 

16 

Table of Contents 
 The Custody Agreements provide for, among other things, the full allocation of all gold credited to the Trust Unallocated Account at the end of each business day. The Sponsor established an overdraft facility with the Custodian under which the Custodian will make available to the Trust Unallocated Account up to 430 fine ounces of gold in order to allow the Custodian to fully allocate all gold credited to the Trust Unallocated Account to the Trust Allocated Account at the end of each business day. 

 Transfers into the Trust Allocated Account 

The Custodian receives transfers of gold into the Trust Allocated Account only at the Trustee s instructions by debiting gold from the Trust Unallocated Account and crediting such gold to the Trust Allocated Account. 

 Transfers from the Trust Allocated Account 

The Custodian transfers gold from the Trust Allocated Account only in accordance with the Trustee s instructions. Generally, the Custodian transfers gold from the Trust Allocated Account only by debiting gold from the Trust Allocated Account and crediting the gold to the Trust Unallocated Account. 

 Withdrawals of Gold Directly from the Trust Allocated Account 

Upon the Trustee s instruction, the Custodian debits gold from the Trust Allocated Account and makes the gold available for collection by the Trustee or, if separately agreed, for delivery by the Custodian in accordance with its usual practices at the Trust s expense and risk. The Trustee and the Custodian expect that the Trustee will withdraw gold physically from the Trust Allocated Account (rather than by crediting it to the Trust Unallocated Account and instructing a further transfer from that account) only in exceptional circumstances, such as if, for some unforeseen reason, it was not possible to transfer gold in unallocated form. The Custodian is not obliged to effect any requested delivery if, in its reasonable opinion, (1) this would cause the Custodian or its agents to be in breach of the Custody Rules or other applicable law, court order or regulation; (2) the costs incurred would be excessive; or (3) delivery is impracticable for any reason. When gold is physically withdrawn from the Trust Allocated Account pursuant to the Trustee s instruction, all right, title, risk and interest in and to the gold withdrawn shall pass to the person to whom or to or for whose account such gold is transferred, delivered or collected at the time the recipient or its agent acknowledges in writing its receipt of gold. Unless the Trustee specifies the bars of gold to be debited from the Trust Allocated Account, the Custodian is entitled to select the gold bars. 

 Exclusion of Liability 

The Custodian will use reasonable care in the performance of its duties under the Custody Agreements and is only responsible for any loss or damage suffered by the Trust as a direct result of any negligence, fraud or willful default in the performance of its duties. The Custodian s liability under the Allocated Bullion Account Agreement is further limited to the market value of the gold held in the Trust Allocated Account at the time such negligence, fraud or willful default is discovered by the Custodian, provided that the Custodian promptly notifies the Trustee of its discovery. The Custodian s liability under the Unallocated Bullion Account Agreement is further limited to the amount of the gold credited to the Trust Unallocated Account at the time such negligence, fraud or willful default is discovered by the Custodian, provided that the Custodian promptly notifies the Trustee of its discovery. 

 Furthermore, the Custodian has no duty to make or take or to require any subcustodian selected by it to make or take any special arrangements or precautions beyond those required by the Custody Rules or as specifically set forth in the Custody Agreements. 

 In the event of a loss caused by the failure of the Custodian or a subcustodian to exercise reasonable care, the Trustee, on behalf of the Trust, has the right to seek recovery from the Custodian or subcustodian in breach. The Custodian is not liable for any delay in performance or any non-performance
 of any of its obligations under the Custody Agreements by reason of any cause beyond its reasonable control, including, acts of God, war or terrorism. 

17 

Table of Contents 
 Indemnity 

Solely out of the Trust s assets, the Trust will indemnify the Custodian and each of its officers, directors, employees and affiliates on demand against all costs and expenses, damages, liabilities and losses which the Custodian or any such officer, director, employee or affiliate may suffer or incur in connection with the Custody Agreements, except to the extent that such sums are due directly to the Custodian s negligence, willful default or fraud. 

 Termination 

The Trustee and the Custodian may each terminate any Custody Agreement upon 90 business days prior notice. The Custody Agreements will also terminate 90 business days after the resignation or removal of the Trustee except as otherwise provided in the Custody Agreements. If either the Allocated Bullion Account Agreement or the Unallocated Bullion Account Agreement is terminated, the other agreement automatically terminates. 

 Governing Law 

The Custody Agreements are governed by English law. The Trustee and the Custodian both consent to the non-exclusive
 jurisdiction of the courts of the State of New York and the federal courts located in the borough of Manhattan in New York City. Such consent is not required for any person to assert a claim of New York jurisdiction over the Trustee or the Custodian. 
 Description of the Shares 

General 

The Trustee is authorized under the Trust Indenture to create and issue an unlimited number of Shares. The Shares represent units of fractional undivided beneficial interest in and ownership of the Trust and have no par value. Any creation and issuance of Shares above the amount registered on the registration statement of which this report is a part will require the registration of such additional Shares. 

 Description of Limited Rights 

The Shares do not represent a traditional investment and Shareholders should not view them as similar to shares of a corporation operating a business enterprise with management and a board of directors. As a Shareholder, you do not have the statutory rights normally associated with the ownership of shares of a corporation, including, for example, the right to bring oppression or derivative actions. All Shares are of the same class with equal rights and privileges. Each Share is transferable, is fully paid and non-assessable
 and entitles the holder to vote on the limited matters upon which Shareholders may vote under the Trust Indenture. The Shares do not entitle their holders to any conversion or pre-emptive
 rights, or, except as provided below, any redemption rights or rights to distributions. 
 Distributions 

The Trust Indenture provides for distributions to Shareholders in only two circumstances. First, if the Trustee and the Sponsor determine that the Trust s cash account balance exceeds the anticipated expenses of the Trust for the next 12 months and the excess amount is more than 0.01 per Share outstanding, they shall direct the excess amount to be distributed to the Shareholders. Second, if the Trust is terminated and liquidated, the Trustee will distribute to the Shareholders any amounts remaining after the satisfaction of all outstanding liabilities of the Trust and the establishment of such reserves for applicable taxes, other governmental charges and contingent or future liabilities as the Trustee shall determine. Shareholders of record on the record date fixed by the Trustee for a distribution will be entitled to receive their pro rata portion of any distribution. 

 Voting and Approvals 

Under the Trust Indenture, Shareholders have no voting rights, except in limited circumstances. Shareholders holding at least 66 2
/ 3
 of the Shares outstanding may vote to remove the Trustee. The Trustee may terminate the Trust upon the agreement of Shareholders owning at least 66 2
/ 3
 of the outstanding Shares. In addition, certain amendments to the Trust Indenture require 51 or unanimous consent of the Shareholders. 

18 

Table of Contents 
 Book-Entry Form 

Individual certificates will not be issued for the Shares. Instead, global certificates are deposited by the Trustee with DTC and registered in the name of Cede Co., as nominee for DTC. The global certificates evidence all of the Shares outstanding at any time. Under the Trust Indenture, Shareholders are limited to: (1) DTC Participants; (2) those who maintain, either directly or indirectly, a custodial relationship with a DTC Participant, or Indirect Participants; and (3) those banks, brokers, dealers, trust companies and others who hold interests in the Shares through DTC Participants or Indirect Participants. The Shares are only transferable through the book-entry system of DTC. Shareholders who are not DTC Participants may transfer their Shares through DTC by instructing the DTC Participant holding their Shares (or by instructing the Indirect Participant or other entity through which their Shares are held) to transfer the Shares. Transfers are made in accordance with standard securities industry practice. 

 United States Federal Tax Consequences 

The following discussion of the material U.S. federal income tax consequences that generally apply to the purchase, ownership and disposition of Shares and gold held by the Trust by a U.S. Shareholder (as defined below), and certain U.S. federal gift and estate tax consequences that generally apply to an investment in Shares by a Non-U.S.
 Shareholder (as defined below), represents, insofar as it describes conclusions as to U.S. federal tax law and subject to the limitations and qualifications described therein, the opinion of Carter Ledyard Milburn LLP, special U.S. federal tax counsel to the Sponsor. The discussion below is based on the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, (the Code ), Treasury Regulations promulgated under the Code and judicial and administrative interpretations of the Code, all as in effect on the date of this annual report and all of which are subject to changes either prospectively or retroactively. The tax treatment of Shareholders may vary depending upon their own particular circumstances. Certain Shareholders (including broker-dealers, traders or other investors with special circumstances) may be subject to special rules not discussed herein. In addition, the following discussion applies only to investors who hold Shares as capital assets within the meaning of Code section 1221. Moreover, the discussion herein does not address the effect of any state, local or foreign tax law on the disposition of Shares. Purchasers of Shares are urged to consult their own tax advisors with respect to all U.S. federal, state, local and foreign tax law considerations potentially applicable to their investment in Shares. 
 For purposes of this discussion, a U.S. Shareholder is a Shareholder that is: 

An individual who is a U.S. citizen or resident of the United States for U.S. federal income tax purposes; 

An entity treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes that is created or organized in or under the laws of the United States or any political subdivision thereof; 

An estate, the income of which is includible in gross income for U.S. federal income tax purposes regardless of its source; or 

A trust, if (1) a court within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration of the trust and one or more U.S. persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust; or (2) the trust has a valid election in effect under applicable U.S. Treasury regulations to be treated as a U.S. person. 

A Shareholder (other than a partnership or other entity subject to tax as a partnership) that is not a U.S. Shareholder as defined above is generally considered a Non-U.S.
 Shareholder for purposes of this discussion. For U.S. federal income tax purposes, the treatment of any beneficial owner of an interest in a partnership, including any entity treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes, will generally depend upon the status of the partner and upon the activities of the partnership. Partnerships and partners in partnerships should consult their tax advisors about the U.S. federal income tax consequences of purchasing, owning and disposing of Shares.

 Taxation of The Trust 

The Trust is treated as a grantor trust for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As a result, the Trust itself is not subject to U.S. federal income tax. Instead, the Trust s income and expenses flow through to the Shareholders, and the Trustee will report the Trust s income, gains, losses and deductions to the Internal Revenue Service (the IRS on that basis. 

 Taxation of U.S. Shareholders 

U.S. Shareholders generally will be treated, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, as if they directly owned a pro rata share of the gold held by the Trust. U.S. Shareholders also will be treated as if they directly derived their respective pro rata shares of the Trust s income, if any, and as if they directly incurred their respective pro rata shares of the Trust s expenses. In the case of a U.S. Shareholder that purchases Shares for cash, its initial tax basis in its pro rata share of the gold held in the Trust at the time it acquires its Shares will be equal to its cost of acquiring the Shares. In the case of a U.S. Shareholder that acquires its Shares by delivering gold to the Trust, the delivery of gold to the Trust in exchange for the underlying gold represented by the Shares will not be a taxable event to the U.S. Shareholder, and the U.S. Shareholder s tax basis and holding period for the U.S. Shareholder s pro rata share of the gold held in the Trust will be the same as its tax basis and holding period for the gold delivered by the U.S. Shareholder in exchange therefor. For purposes of this discussion, it is assumed that all of a U.S. Shareholder s Shares are acquired on the same date, at the same price per Share and, except where otherwise noted, that the sole asset of the Trust is gold. 

 When the Trust sells gold, for example to pay expenses, a U.S. Shareholder generally will recognize gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference between (1) the U.S. Shareholder s pro rata share of the amount realized by the Trust upon the sale; and (2) the U.S. Shareholder s tax basis for its pro rata share of the gold that was sold, which gain or loss will generally be long-term or short-term capital gain or loss, depending upon whether the U.S. Shareholder has held its Shares for more than one year (see discussion below on the applicable tax rates with respect to such capital gain or loss). A U.S. Shareholder s tax basis for its share of any gold sold by the Trust generally will be determined by multiplying the U.S. Shareholder s total basis for its share of all of the gold held in the Trust immediately prior to the sale, by a fraction the numerator of which is the amount of gold sold and the denominator of which is the total amount of the gold held in the Trust immediately prior to the sale. Immediately after any such sale, a U.S. Shareholder s tax basis for its pro rata share of the gold remaining in the Trust will equal its tax basis for its share of the total amount of the gold held in the Trust immediately prior to the sale, less the portion of such basis allocable to its share of the gold that was sold. 

 Upon a U.S. Shareholder s sale of some or all of its Shares, the U.S. Shareholder will be treated as having sold the portion of its pro rata share of the gold held in the Trust at the time of the sale that is attributable to the Shares sold. Accordingly, the U.S. Shareholder generally will recognize gain or loss on the sale of the Shares in an amount equal to the difference between (1) the amount realized pursuant to the sale of the Shares; and (2) the U.S. Shareholder s tax basis for the portion of its pro rata share of the gold held in the Trust at the time of sale that is attributable to the Shares sold, determined by multiplying the U.S. Shareholder s tax basis for its pro rata share of the gold held in the Trust immediately prior to the sale by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of Shares sold and the denominator of which is the number of Shares held by the U.S. Shareholder immediately prior to the sale. 

 A redemption of some or all of a U.S. Shareholder s Shares in exchange for the underlying gold represented by the Shares redeemed generally will not be a taxable event to the U.S. Shareholder. The U.S. Shareholder s tax basis for the gold received in the redemption generally will be the same as the U.S. Shareholder s tax basis for the portion of its pro rata share of the gold held in the Trust immediately prior to the redemption that is attributable to the Shares redeemed. This is determined by multiplying the U.S. Shareholder s tax basis for its pro rata share of the gold held in the Trust immediately prior to the redemption by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of Shares redeemed and the denominator of which is the number of Shares held by the U.S. Shareholder immediately prior to the redemption. The U.S. Shareholder s holding period with respect to the gold received should include the period during which the U.S. Shareholder held the Shares redeemed. A subsequent sale of the gold received by the U.S. Shareholder will be a taxable event. 

20 

Table of Contents 
 Immediately after any sale or redemption of less than all of a U.S. Shareholder s Shares, the U.S. Shareholder s tax basis for its pro rata share of the gold held in the Trust immediately after such sale or redemption generally will equal its tax basis for its share of the total amount of the gold held in the Trust immediately prior to the sale or redemption, reduced by the portion of such basis that is attributable to the Shares sold or redeemed, as addressed above. 

 As noted above, the foregoing discussion assumes that all of a U.S. Shareholder s Shares were acquired on the same date and at the same price per Share. If a U.S. Shareholder owns multiple lots of Shares (i.e., Shares acquired on different dates and/or at different prices), it is uncertain whether the U.S. Shareholder may use the specific identification rules that apply under Treasury regulations section 1.1012-1(c)
 with respect to sales of shares of stock, in determining the amount, and the long-term or short-term character, of any gain or loss recognized by the U.S. Shareholder upon the sale of gold by the Trust, upon the sale of any Shares by the U.S. Shareholder, or upon the sale by the U.S. Shareholder of any gold received by it upon the redemption of any of its Shares. The IRS could take the position that a U.S. Shareholder has a blended tax basis and holding period for its pro rata share of the underlying gold in the Trust. However, there is no Code section, Regulation or other guidance on this point. U.S. Shareholders that hold multiple lots of Shares, or that are contemplating acquiring multiple lots of Shares, should consult their own tax advisors as to the determination of the tax basis and holding period for the underlying gold related to such Shares. 
 Maximum 28 Long-Term Capital Gains Tax Rate for U.S. Shareholders Who are Individuals 

Under current law, gains recognized by individuals from the sale of collectibles, including gold bullion, held for more than one year are taxed at a maximum rate of 28 , rather than the 20 rate applicable to most other long-term capital gains. However, if an individual U.S. Shareholder is otherwise subject to a rate lower than 28 , the 28 rate does not apply and such lower rate will apply. For these purposes, a gain recognized by an individual upon the sale of an interest (such as the Shares) in a trust that holds collectibles is treated as gain recognized on the sale of collectibles, to the extent that such gain is attributable to unrealized appreciation in the value of the collectibles held by the trust. Therefore, any gain recognized by an individual U.S. Shareholder attributable to a sale of Shares held for more than one year, or attributable to the Trust s sale of any gold bullion that the individual U.S. Shareholder is treated (through its ownership of Shares) as having held for more than one year, generally will be taxed at a maximum rate of 28 . The tax rates for capital gains recognized upon the sale of assets held by an individual U.S. Shareholder for one year or less are generally the same as those at which ordinary income is taxed. The deductibility of capital losses by an individual U.S. Shareholder is subject to limitations. 

 3.8 Tax on Net Investment Income 

Under current law, U.S. Shareholders that are individuals, estates or trusts, whose income exceeds certain thresholds, are subject to a 3.8 Medicare contribution tax on their net investment income, which generally includes capital gains from the disposition of property. This tax is in addition to any capital gains taxes due on such investment income (discussed above). 

 Brokerage Fees and Trust Expenses 

Any brokerage or other transaction fee incurred by a U.S. Shareholder in connection with purchasing Shares will be treated as part of the U.S. Shareholder s tax basis in the underlying assets of the Trust. Similarly, any brokerage fee incurred by a U.S. Shareholder in selling Shares will reduce the amount realized by the U.S. Shareholder with respect to the sale. 

 U.S. Shareholders will be required to recognize gain or loss upon a sale of gold by the Trust (as discussed above), even though some or all of the proceeds of such sale are used by the Trustee to pay Trust expenses. U.S. Shareholders may deduct their respective pro rata shares of each expense incurred by the Trust to the same extent as if they directly incurred such expense. U.S. Shareholders that are individuals, estates or trusts, however, may be required to treat some or all of the expenses of the Trust as miscellaneous itemized deductions. An individual 

21 

Table of Contents 
 U.S. Shareholder may not deduct miscellaneous itemized deductions for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017 and before January 1, 2026. For tax years beginning after December 31, 2025, an individual U.S. Shareholder may deduct certain miscellaneous itemized deductions only to the extent they exceed 2 of adjusted gross income. In addition, such deductions may be subject to phase-outs and other limitations under applicable provisions of the Code and regulations thereunder and, if the U.S. Shareholder is an individual subject to the alternative minimum tax, may not be deductible at all. 

 Investment by Tax-Exempt
 U.S. Shareholders 

Tax-exempt
 U.S. Shareholders are generally subject to U.S. federal income tax only on their unrelated business taxable income UBTI ). In addition, a tax-exempt
 U.S. Shareholder that is a private foundation is also subject to certain U.S. federal excise taxes, including a 2 (or 1 excise tax under Section 4940 of the Code on its net investment income, which would include any gain recognized on the sale of any of its Shares or its share of any gain recognized on the Trust s sale of gold, provided such gain did not constitute UBTI. Unless a tax-exempt
 U.S. Shareholder incurs debt in order to purchase Shares, it is expected that tax-exempt
 U.S. Shareholders should not realize UBTI in respect of income or gains from the Shares. Tax-exempt
 U.S. Shareholders should consult their own tax advisors about the U.S. federal income and excise tax consequences of purchasing, owning and disposing of Shares in light of their particular circumstances. 
 Investment by Regulated Investment Companies 

Mutual funds and other investment vehicles that are regulated investment companies within the meaning of Code Section 851 should consult with their own tax advisors concerning (1) the likelihood that an investment in Shares, although the Shares are securities within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940, may be considered an investment in the underlying gold for purposes of Code section 851(b), and (2) the extent to which an investment in Shares might nevertheless be consistent with preservation of their qualification under Code Section 851. 

 Investment by Certain Retirement Plans 

Code Section 408(m) provides that the acquisition of a collectible which is defined to include any metal or gem and any stamp or coin that is not a gold coin described in paragraph (7), (8), (9) , or (10) of section 5112(a) of title 31, United States Code (such gold coin, a Non-Collectible
 Gold Coin ), nor gold bullion of a fineness equal to or exceeding the minimum fineness that a contract market (as described in section 5 of the Commodity Exchange Act, 7 U.S.C. 7) requires for metals that may be delivered in satisfaction of a regulated futures contract if such bullion is in the physical possession of a trustee under Code Section 408(a) (such gold bullion, Non-Collectible
 Gold Bullion by an individual retirement account, or IRA, or a participant-directed account maintained under any plan that is tax-qualified
 under Code Section 401(a), is treated as a taxable distribution from the account to the owner of the IRA, or to the participant for whom the plan account is maintained, of an amount equal to the cost to the account of acquiring the collectible. 
 The Sponsor has received a private letter ruling from the IRS concluding that a purchase of Shares by an IRA, or by a participant-directed account under a Code Section 401(a) plan (a plan account ), will not be treated as the acquisition of a collectible by the IRA or plan, and will not result in a taxable distribution to the IRA owner or plan participant under Code Section 408(m). However, if Shares are distributed by the trustee or custodian of an IRA or plan account to the IRA owner or participant, or if a redemption of any Shares held by an IRA or plan account results in the distribution of gold to the IRA or account (or such redemption is treated as distributed under Section 408), other than Non-Collectible
 Gold Coins or Non-Collectible
 Gold Bullion, such distribution would be taxable to the distributee in the year of distribution to the extent provided under the applicable provisions of Code Sections 408(d), 408(m) or 402. See also ERISA and Related Considerations. 
 U.S. Information Reporting and Backup Withholding for U.S. and Non-U.S.
 Shareholders 

The Trustee will file certain information returns with the IRS, and provide certain tax-related
 information to Shareholders, in connection with the Trust. Each Shareholder will be provided with information regarding its allocable portion of the Trust s annual income and gains (if any) and expenses. 

22 

Table of Contents 
 A U.S. Shareholder may be subject to U.S. backup withholding tax in certain circumstances unless it provides its taxpayer identification number TIN and complies with certain certification procedures. Non-U.S.
 Shareholders may have to comply with certification procedures to establish that they are not U.S. persons in order to avoid the information reporting and backup withholding tax requirements. 
 The amount of any backup withholding will be allowed as a credit against a Shareholder s U.S. federal income tax liability and may entitle such a Shareholder to a refund, provided that the required information is furnished to the IRS. 

 Income Taxation of Non-U.S.
 Shareholders 

The Trust does not expect to generate taxable income except for gain (if any) upon the sale of gold. A Non-U.S.
 Shareholder generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax with respect to gain recognized upon the sale or other disposition of Shares, or upon the sale of gold by the Trust, unless (1) the Non-U.S.
 Shareholder is an individual and is present in the United States for 183 days or more during the taxable year of the sale or other disposition, and certain other conditions are met; or (2) the gain is effectively connected with the conduct by the Non-U.S.
 Shareholder of a trade or business in the United States (and, if required by an applicable income tax treaty, is attributable to a U.S. permanent establishment). If clause (1) of the preceding sentence applies, the Non-U.S.
 Shareholder generally will be subject to a flat 30 U.S. federal income tax on any gain recognized, which may be offset by certain U.S. source losses. If clause (2) of the preceding sentence applies, the Non-U.S.
 Shareholder will generally be required to pay U.S. federal income tax on the net gain derived from the sale in the same manner as a U.S. Shareholder, as described above. In addition, corporate Non-U.S.
 Shareholders may be subject to a 30 branch profits tax on their effectively connected earnings and profits attributable to such gain (subject to adjustments). If a Non-U.S.
 Shareholder is eligible for the benefits of a tax treaty between the United States and its country of residence, the tax treatment of any such gain may be modified in the manner specified by the treaty. 
 Estate and Gift Tax Considerations for Non-U.S.
 Shareholders 

Under the U.S. federal estate tax law, individuals who are neither citizens nor residents (as determined for U.S. federal estate and gift tax purposes) of the United States are subject to U.S. federal estate tax on all property that is situated in the U.S. at the time of death. Shares may well be considered to be situated in the U.S. for these purposes. If they are, then Shares would be includible in the U.S. gross estate of a non-resident
 alien Shareholder. Currently, U.S. federal estate tax is imposed at rates of up to 40 of the fair market value of the taxable estate. The U.S. federal estate tax rate is subject to change in future years. In addition, the U.S. federal generation-skipping transfer tax may apply in certain circumstances. The estate of a non-resident
 alien Shareholder who was resident in a country that has an estate tax treaty with the United States may be entitled to benefit from such treaty. 
 For non-citizens
 and non-residents
 of the United States, the U.S. federal gift tax generally applies only to gifts of tangible personal property or real property that is situated in the United States. Tangible personal property (including gold) is situated in the United States if it is physically located in the United States. Although the matter is not settled, it appears that ownership of Shares should not be considered ownership of the underlying gold for this purpose, even if that gold were held in custody in the United States. Instead, Shares should be considered intangible property, and therefore they should not be subject to U.S. federal gift tax if transferred during the Non-U.S.
 Shareholder s lifetime. 
 Taxation in Jurisdictions Other than the United States 

Prospective purchasers of Shares that are based in or acting out of a jurisdiction other than the United States are advised to consult their own tax advisors as to the tax consequences, under the laws of such jurisdiction (or any other jurisdiction not being the United States to which they are subject), of their purchase, holding, sale and redemption of or any other dealing in Shares and, in particular, whether any value added tax, other consumption tax or transfer tax is payable in relation to such purchase, holding, sale, redemption or other dealing in Shares.

 ERISA and Related Considerations 

The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, or ERISA ), and/or Code section 4975 impose certain requirements on employee benefit plans and certain other plans and arrangements that are subject to ERISA or the Code, including IRAs and annuities, retirement plans for self-employed individuals (so-called
 Keogh plans), and certain collective investment funds and insurance company general or separate accounts in which such plans or arrangements are invested, collectively the Plans, and on persons who are fiduciaries with respect to the investment of assets treated as plan assets of a Plan. Government plans and some church plans are not subject to the fiduciary responsibility provisions of ERISA or the provisions of section 4975 of the Code but may be subject to substantially similar rules under state or other federal law. 
 In contemplating an investment of a portion of Plan assets in Shares, the Plan fiduciary responsible for making such investment should carefully consider, taking into account the facts and circumstances of the Plan, the Risk Factors discussed above and whether such investment is consistent with its fiduciary responsibilities, including, but not limited to: (1) whether the fiduciary has the authority to make the investment under the appropriate governing plan instrument; (2) whether the investment would constitute a direct or indirect prohibited transaction with a party in interest or disqualified person, as described in ERISA section 406 or Section 4975 of the Code, as applicable, that is not otherwise subject to a statutory exemption or prohibited transaction exemption issued by the Department of Labor; (3) the Plan s funding objectives; and (4) whether under the general fiduciary standards of investment prudence and diversification such investment is appropriate for the Plan, taking into account the overall investment policy of the Plan, the composition of the Plan s investment portfolio and the Plan s need for sufficient liquidity to pay benefits when due. The Shares constitute publicly-offered securities as defined in Department of Labor Regulations 2510.3-
 101(b)(2). Accordingly, Shares purchased by a Plan, and not an interest in the underlying gold bullion held in the Trust represented by the Shares, should be treated as assets of the Plan, for purposes of applying the fiduciary responsibility and prohibited transaction rules of ERISA and the Code. See also United States Federal Tax Consequences Investment by Certain Retirement Plans. 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors

You should consider carefully the risks described below before making an investment decision. You should also refer to the other information included in this report, including the Trust s financial statements and the related notes. 

Risks Related to Gold 

Crises may motivate large-scale sales of gold which could decrease the price of gold and adversely affect an investment in the Shares. 

The possibility of large-scale distress sales of gold in times of crisis may have a negative impact on the price of gold and adversely affect an investment in the Shares. For example, the 2008 financial crisis resulted in significant sales of gold by individuals which depressed the price of gold. Crises in the future may impair gold s price performance which would, in turn, adversely affect an investment in the Shares. 

 Substantial sales of gold by the official sector could adversely affect an investment in the Shares. 

The official sector consists of central banks, other governmental agencies and international organizations that buy, sell and hold gold as part of their reserve assets. The official sector holds a significant amount of gold, most of which is static, meaning that it is held in vaults and is not bought, sold, leased or swapped or otherwise mobilized in the open market. See The Gold Industry Sources of Gold Supply and Movements in the Price of Gold for more details. In the event that future economic, political or social conditions or pressures require members of the official sector to liquidate their gold assets all at once or in an uncoordinated manner, the demand for gold might not be sufficient to accommodate the sudden increase in the supply of gold to the market. Consequently, the price of gold could decline significantly, which would adversely affect an investment in the Shares.

Table of Contents 
 The price of gold may be affected by the sale of gold by ETFs or other exchange traded vehicles tracking gold markets. 

To the extent existing exchange traded funds ETFs or other exchange traded vehicles tracking gold markets represent a significant proportion of demand for physical gold bullion, large redemptions of the securities of these ETFs or other exchange traded vehicles could negatively affect physical gold bullion prices and the price and NAV of the Shares. 

 The value of the gold held by the Trust is determined using the LBMA Gold Price PM. Potential discrepancies in the calculation of the LBMA Gold Price PM, as well as any future changes to the LBMA Gold Price PM, could impact the value of the gold held by the Trust and could have an adverse effect on the value of an investment in the Shares. 

The LBMA Gold Price is determined twice each business day (10:30 a.m. and 3:00 p.m. London time) by the participants in a physically settled, electronic and tradable auction administered by the IBA using a bidding process that determines the price of gold by matching buy and sell orders submitted by the participants for the applicable auction time. The net asset value of the Trust is determined each day the Trust s principal market, the NYSE Arca, is open for regular trading, using the LBMA Gold Price PM. If the LBMA Gold Price PM has not been announced by 12:00 PM New York time on a particular evaluation day, the next most recent LBMA Gold Price (AM or PM) is used in the determination of the net asset value of the Trust. The Trust, the Sponsor, and the Trustee do not participate in establishing the LBMA Gold Price. Other trusts backed by physical gold also use the LBMA Gold Price to determine their asset value. The LBMA Gold Price replaced the London Gold Fix on March 20, 2015 and has become a widely used benchmark for daily gold prices. 

 In the event that the LBMA Gold Price PM does not prove to be an accurate benchmark, and the LBMA Gold Price PM varies materially from the price determined by other mechanisms, the Net Asset Value of the Trust and the value of an investment in the Shares could be adversely impacted. Any future developments in the benchmark, to the extent they have a material impact on the LBMA Gold Price PM, could adversely impact the Net Asset Value of the Trust and the value of an investment in the Shares. Further, the calculation of the LBMA Gold Price PM is not an exact process. Rather it is based upon a procedure of matching orders from participants in the auction process and their customers to sell gold with orders from participants in the auction process and their customers to buy gold at particular prices. The LBMA Gold Price PM does not therefore purport to reflect each buyer or seller of gold in the market, nor does it purport to set a definitive price for gold at which all orders for sale or purchase will take place on that particular day or time. All orders placed into the auction process by the participants will be executed on the basis of the price determined pursuant to the LBMA Gold Price PM auction process (provided that orders may be cancelled, increased or decreased while the auction is in progress). It is possible that electronic failures or other unanticipated events may occur that could result in delays in the announcement of, or the inability of the system to produce, an LBMA Gold Price PM on any given date. 

 Risks Related to the Custody of Gold 

The Trust s gold may be subject to loss, damage, theft or restriction on access. 

There is a risk that some or all of the Trust s gold bars held by the Custodian or any subcustodian on behalf of the Trust could be lost, damaged or stolen. Access to the Trust s gold bars could also be restricted by natural events (such as an earthquake) or human actions (such as a terrorist attack). Any of these events may adversely affect the operations of the Trust and, consequently, an investment in the Shares. 

 The Trust may not have adequate sources of recovery if its gold is lost, damaged, stolen or destroyed and recovery may be limited, even in the event of fraud, to the market value of the gold at the time the fraud is discovered. 

Shareholders recourse against the Trust, the Trustee and the Sponsor, under New York law, the Custodian, under English law, and any subcustodians under the law governing their custody operations is limited. The Trust does not insure its gold. The Custodian maintains insurance with regard to its business on such terms and conditions as 

25 

Table of Contents 
 it considers appropriate which does not cover the full amount of gold. The Trust is not a beneficiary of any such insurance and does not have the ability to dictate the existence, nature or amount of coverage. Therefore, Shareholders cannot be assured that the Custodian will maintain adequate insurance or any insurance with respect to the gold held by the Custodian on behalf of the Trust. In addition, the Custodian and the Trustee do not require any direct or indirect subcustodians to be insured or bonded with respect to their custodial activities or in respect of the gold held by them on behalf of the Trust. Consequently, a loss may be suffered with respect to the Trust s gold which is not covered by insurance and for which no person is liable in damages. 

 The liability of the Custodian is limited under the Custody Agreements. Under the Custody Agreements, the Custodian is only liable for losses that are the direct result of its own negligence, fraud or willful default in the performance of its duties. Any such liability is further limited, in the case of the Allocated Bullion Account Agreement, to the market value of the gold bars held in the Trust s allocated gold account (Trust Allocated Account) at the time such negligence, fraud or willful default is discovered by the Custodian and, in the case of the Unallocated Bullion Account Agreement, to the amount of gold credited to the Trust s unallocated gold account (Trust Unallocated Account) at the time such negligence, fraud or willful default is discovered by the Custodian. The Custodian is not contractually or otherwise liable for any losses suffered by any Authorized Participant or Shareholder that are not the direct result of its own negligence, fraud or willful default in the performance of its duties under such agreement, and in no event will its liability exceed the market value of the balance in the Authorized Participant Unallocated Account at the time such gross negligence, fraud or willful default is discovered by the Custodian. 

 In addition, the Custodian will not be liable for any delay in performance or any non-performance
 of any of its obligations under the Custody Agreements by reason of any cause beyond its reasonable control, including acts of God, war or terrorism. As a result, the recourse of the Trustee or the investor, under English law, is limited. Furthermore, under English common law, the Custodian or any subcustodian will not be liable for any delay in the performance or any non-performance
 of its custodial obligations by reason of any cause beyond its reasonable control. 
 Gold bars may be held by one or more subcustodians appointed by the Custodian, or employed by the subcustodians appointed by the Custodian, until it is transported to the Custodian s London vault premises. Under the Allocated Bullion Account Agreement, except for an obligation on the part of the Custodian to use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain delivery of the Trust s gold bars from any subcustodians appointed by the Custodian, the Custodian is not liable for the acts or omissions of its subcustodians unless the selection of such subcustodians was made negligently or in bad faith. 

 The obligations of the Custodian under the Allocated Bullion Account Agreement, the Unallocated Bullion Account Agreement and the Participant Unallocated Bullion Account Agreement are governed by English law. The Custodian may enter into arrangements with subcustodians, which arrangements may also be governed by English law. The Trust is a New York investment trust. Any federal, New York, or other court situated in the United States may have difficulty interpreting English law (which, insofar as it relates to custody arrangements, is largely derived from court rulings rather than statute), LBMA rules or the customs and practices in the London custody market. It may be difficult or impossible for the Trust to sue a subcustodian in a United States, New York or other court situated in the United States. In addition, it may be difficult, time consuming and/or expensive for the Trust to enforce in a foreign court a judgment rendered by a federal, New York, or other court situated in the United States. 

 If any subcustodian which holds gold on a temporary basis does not exercise due care in the safekeeping of the Trust s gold bars, the ability of the Trustee or the Custodian to recover damages against such subcustodian may be limited to only such recourse, if any, as may be available under applicable English law or other applicable law. If the Trustee s or the Custodian s recourse against the subcustodian is so limited, the Trust may not be adequately compensated for the loss. For more information on the Trustee s and the Custodian s ability to seek recovery against subcustodians, the use of subcustodians in the most recent fiscal year and the subcustodian s duty to safekeep the Trust s gold bars, see Custody of the Trust s Gold.

Table of Contents 
 If the Trust s gold bars are lost, damaged, stolen or destroyed under circumstances rendering a party liable to the Trust, the responsible party may not have the financial resources sufficient to satisfy the Trust s claim. For example, as to a particular event of loss, the only source of recovery for the Trust might be limited to the Custodian, as currently it is the sole custodian holding all of the Trust s gold; or one or more subcustodians, if appointed; or, to the extent identifiable, other responsible third parties (e.g., a thief or terrorist), any of which may not have the financial resources (including liability insurance coverage) to satisfy a valid claim of the Trust. 

 Neither the Shareholders nor any Authorized Participant has a right under the Custody Agreements to assert a claim of the Trustee against the Custodian or any subcustodian; claims under the Custody Agreements may only be asserted by the Trustee on behalf of the Trust. 

 Because neither the Trustee nor the Custodian oversees or monitors the activities of subcustodians who may temporarily hold the Trust s gold bars until transported to the Custodian s London vault, failure by the subcustodians to exercise due care in the safekeeping of the Trust s gold bars could result in a loss to the Trust. 

Under the Allocated Bullion Account Agreement, the Custodian agreed that it will hold all of the Trust s gold bars in its own vault premises except when the gold bars have been allocated in a vault other than the Custodian s vault premises, and in such cases the Custodian agreed that it will use commercially reasonable efforts promptly to transport the gold bars to the Custodian s vault, at the Custodian s cost and risk. Nevertheless, there will be periods of time when some portion of the Trust s gold bars may be held by one or more subcustodians appointed by the Custodian or by a subcustodian of such subcustodian. The Allocated Bullion Account Agreement is described in Description of the Custody Agreements. 

 The Custodian is required under the Allocated Bullion Account Agreement to use reasonable care in appointing its subcustodians but otherwise has no other responsibility in relation to the subcustodians appointed by it. These subcustodians may in turn appoint further subcustodians, but the Custodian is not responsible for the appointment of these further subcustodians. The Custodian does not undertake to monitor the performance by subcustodians of their custody functions or their selection of further subcustodians. The Trustee does not undertake to monitor the performance of any subcustodian. Furthermore, the Trustee may have no right to visit the premises of any subcustodian for the purposes of examining the Trust s gold bars or any records maintained by the subcustodian, and no subcustodian will be obligated to cooperate in any review the Trustee may wish to conduct of the facilities, procedures, records or creditworthiness of such subcustodian. See Custody of the Trust s Gold for more information about subcustodians that may hold the Trust s gold. 

 In addition, the ability of the Trustee to monitor the performance of the Custodian may be limited because under the Custody Agreements the Trustee has only limited rights to visit the premises of the Custodian for the purpose of examining the Trust s gold bars and certain related records maintained by the Custodian. 

 The ability of the Trustee and the Custodian to take legal action against subcustodians may be limited, which increases the possibility that the Trust may suffer a loss if a subcustodian does not use due care in the safekeeping of the Trust s gold bars. 

If any subcustodian which holds gold on a temporary basis does not exercise due care in the safekeeping of the Trust s gold bars, the ability of the Trustee or the Custodian to recover damages against such subcustodian may be limited to only such recourse, if any, as may be available under applicable English law or, if the subcustodian is not located in England, under other applicable law. This is because there are expected to be no written contractual arrangements between subcustodians who may hold the Trust s gold bars and the Trustee or the Custodian, as the case may be. If the Trustee s or the Custodian s recourse against the subcustodian is so limited, the Trust may not be adequately compensated for the loss. For more information on the Trustee s and the Custodian s ability to seek recovery against subcustodians, the use of subcustodians in the most recent fiscal year and the subcustodian s duty to safekeep the Trust s gold bars, see Custody of the Trust s Gold.

Table of Contents 
 Gold held in the Trust s unallocated gold account and any Authorized Participant s unallocated gold account will not be segregated from the Custodian s assets. If the Custodian becomes insolvent, its assets may not be adequate to satisfy a claim by the Trust or any Authorized Participant. In addition, in the event of the Custodian s insolvency, there may be a delay and costs incurred in identifying the gold bars held in the Trust s allocated gold account. 

Gold which is part of a deposit for a purchase order or part of a redemption distribution will be held for a time in the Trust Unallocated Account and, previously or subsequently, in the Authorized Participant Unallocated Account of the purchasing or redeeming Authorized Participant. During those times, the Trust and the Authorized Participant, as the case may be, will have no proprietary rights to any specific bars of gold held by the Custodian and will each be an unsecured creditor of the Custodian with respect to the amount of gold held in such unallocated accounts. In addition, if the Custodian fails to allocate the Trust s gold in a timely manner, in the proper amounts or otherwise in accordance with the terms of the Unallocated Bullion Account Agreement, or if a subcustodian fails to so segregate gold held by it on behalf of the Trust, unallocated gold will not be segregated from the Custodian s assets, and the Trust will be an unsecured creditor of the Custodian with respect to the amount so held in the event of the insolvency of the Custodian. In the event the Custodian becomes insolvent, the Custodian s assets might not be adequate to satisfy a claim by the Trust or the Authorized Participant for the amount of gold held in their respective unallocated gold accounts. 

 In the event of the insolvency of the Custodian, a liquidator may seek to freeze access to the gold held in all of the accounts held by the Custodian, including the Trust Allocated Account. Although the Trust would retain legal title to the allocated gold bars, the Trust could incur expenses in connection with obtaining control of the allocated gold bars, and the assertion of a claim by such liquidator for unpaid fees due to the Custodian could delay creations and redemptions of Baskets. 

 The gold bullion custody operations of the Custodian are not subject to specific governmental regulatory supervision. 

The Custodian is responsible for the safekeeping of the Trust s gold bullion that the Custodian allocates to the Trust in connection with the creation of Baskets by Authorized Participants. The Custodian also facilitates the transfer of gold in and out of the Trust through unallocated gold accounts it maintains for Authorized Participants and the Trust. Although the Custodian is a market maker, clearer and approved weigher under the rules of the LBMA (which sets out good practices for participants in the bullion market), the LBMA is not an official or governmental regulatory body. Furthermore, although the Custodian is subject to general banking regulations by U.S. regulators and is generally regulated in the U.K. by the Prudential Regulation Authority and the FCA, such regulations do not directly cover the Custodian s gold bullion custody operations in the U.K. Accordingly, the Trust is dependent on the Custodian to comply with the best practices of the LBMA and to implement satisfactory internal controls for its gold bullion custody operations in order to keep the Trust s gold secure. 

 General Risks 

The Trust relies on the information and technology systems of the Trustee, the Custodian, the Marketing Agent and, to a lesser degree, the Sponsor, which could be adversely affected by information systems interruptions, cybersecurity attacks or other disruptions which could have a material adverse effect on our record keeping and operations. 

The Custodian, the Trustee and the Marketing Agent depend upon information technology infrastructure, including network, hardware and software systems to conduct their business as it relates to the Trust. A cybersecurity incident, or a failure to protect their computer systems, networks and information against cybersecurity threats, could result in a loss of information and adversely impact their ability to conduct their business, including their business on behalf of the Trust. Despite implementation of network and other cybersecurity measures, their security measures may not be adequate to protect against all cybersecurity threats. 

28 

Table of Contents 
 The Trust as well as the Sponsor and its service providers are vulnerable to the effects of public health crises, including the ongoing novel coronavirus pandemic (the COVID-19
 pandemic ). 

Pandemics and other public health crises may cause a curtailment of business activities which may potentially impact the ability of the Sponsor and its service providers to operate. The COVID-19
 pandemic or a similar public health threat could adversely impact the Trust by causing operating delays and disruptions, market disruption and shutdowns (including as a result of government regulation and prevention measures). The COVID-19
 pandemic has had and will likely continue to have serious negative effects on social, economic and financial systems, including significant uncertainty and volatility in the financial markets. 
 Governmental authorities and regulators throughout the world have, in the past, responded to major economic disruptions with a variety of fiscal and monetary policy changes, such as quantitative easing, new monetary programs and lower interest rates. An unexpected or quick reversal of these policies, or the ineffectiveness of these policies, is likely to increase volatility in the market generally, and could specifically increase volatility in the market for gold, which could adversely affect the price of the Shares. The outbreak could also cause the closure of futures exchanges, which could eliminate the ability of Authorized Participants to hedge purchases of Baskets, increasing trading costs of Shares and resulting in a sustained premium or discount in the Shares. The duration of the outbreak and its effects cannot be determined with any reasonable amount of certainty. A prolonged outbreak could result in an increase of the costs of the Trust, affect liquidity in the market for gold as well as the correlation between the price of the Shares and the net asset value of the Trust, any of which could adversely and materially affect the value of your Shares. The outbreak could impair information technology and other operational systems upon which the Trust s service providers, including the Sponsor, the Trustee and the essential tasks on behalf of the Trust. To date, the impact of COVID-19
 has not materially affected the operations of the Trust. 
 Potential conflicts of interest may arise among the Sponsor or its affiliates and the Trust. 

Conflicts of interest may arise among the Sponsor and its affiliates, on the one hand, and the Trust and its Shareholders, on the other hand. As a result of these conflicts, the Sponsor may favor its own interests and the interests of its affiliates over the Trust and its Shareholders. As an example, the Sponsor, its affiliates and their officers and employees are not prohibited from engaging in other businesses or activities, including those that might be in direct competition with the Trust. 

 Risks Related to the Shares 

The value of the Shares relates directly to the value of the gold held by the Trust and fluctuations in the price of gold could materially adversely affect an investment in the Shares. 

The Shares are designed to mirror as closely as possible the performance of the price of gold, and the value of the Shares relates directly to the value of the gold held by the Trust, less the Trust s liabilities (including estimated accrued expenses). The price of gold has fluctuated widely over the past several years. Several factors may affect the price of gold, including: 

Global gold supply and demand, which is influenced by such factors as gold s uses in jewelry, technology and industrial applications, purchases made by investors in the form of bars, coins and other gold products, forward selling by gold producers, purchases made by gold producers to unwind gold hedge positions, central bank purchases and sales, and production and cost levels in major gold-producing countries such as China, the United States and Australia; 

Global or regional political, economic or financial events and situations, especially those unexpected in nature; 

Investors expectations with respect to the rate of inflation; 

Currency exchange rates; 

29 

Table of Contents 

Interest rates; 

Investment and trading activities of hedge funds and commodity funds; and 

Other economic variables such as income growth, economic output, and monetary policies. 

The Shares have experienced significant price fluctuations. If gold markets continue to be subject to sharp fluctuations, this may result in potential losses if you need to sell your Shares at a time when the price of gold is lower than it was when you made your investment. Even if you are able to hold Shares for the long-term, you may never experience a profit, since gold markets have historically experienced extended periods of flat or declining prices, in addition to sharp fluctuations. 

 In addition, investors should be aware that while gold is used to preserve wealth by investors around the world, there is no assurance that gold will maintain its long-term value in terms of purchasing power in the future. In the event that the price of gold declines, the Sponsor expects the value of an investment in the Shares to decline proportionately. 

 If concerns about the integrity or reliability of the LBMA Gold Price PM arise, even if eventually shown to be without merit, such concerns could adversely affect investor interest in gold and therefore adversely affect the price of gold and the value of an investment in the Shares. 

Because the net asset value of the Trust is determined using the LBMA Gold Price PM, discrepancies in, or manipulation of the calculation of the LBMA Gold Price PM could have an adverse impact on the value of an investment in the Shares. Furthermore, any concern about the integrity or reliability of the pricing mechanism could disrupt trading in gold and products using the LBMA Gold Price PM, such as the Shares. In addition, these concerns could potentially lead to changes in the manner in which the LBMA Gold Price PM is calculated and/or the discontinuance of the LBMA Gold Price PM altogether. Each of these factors could lead to less liquidity or greater price volatility for gold and products using the LBMA Gold Price PM, such as the Shares, or otherwise could have an adverse impact on the trading price of the Shares. 

 The amount of gold represented by the Shares will continue to be reduced during the life of the Trust due to the sales of gold necessary to pay the Trust s expenses irrespective of whether the trading price of the Shares rises or falls in response to changes in the price of gold. 

Each outstanding Share represents a fractional, undivided interest in the gold held by the Trust. The Trust does not generate any income and regularly sells gold to pay for its ongoing expenses. Therefore, the amount of gold represented by each Share has gradually declined over time. This is also true with respect to Shares that are issued in exchange for additional deposits of gold into the Trust, as the amount of gold required to create Shares proportionately reflects the amount of gold represented by the Shares outstanding at the time of creation. Assuming a constant gold price, the trading price of the Shares is expected to gradually decline relative to the price of gold as the amount of gold represented by the Shares gradually declines. 

 Investors should be aware that the gradual decline in the amount of gold represented by the Shares will occur regardless of whether the trading price of the Shares rises or falls in response to changes in the price of gold. The estimated ordinary operating expenses of the Trust, which accrue daily commencing after the first day of trading of the Shares, are described in Trust Expenses. 

 The Trust is a passive investment vehicle. This means that the value of the Shares may be adversely affected by Trust losses that, if the Trust had been actively managed, it might have been possible to avoid. 

The Trustee does not actively manage the gold held by the Trust. This means that the Trustee does not sell gold at times when its price is high, or acquire gold at low prices in the expectation of future price increases. It also means that the Trustee does not make use of any of the hedging techniques available to professional gold investors to attempt to reduce the risks of losses resulting from price decreases. Any losses sustained by the Trust will adversely affect the value of the Shares.

 The Shares may trade at a price which is at, above or below the NAV per Share and any discount or premium in the trading price relative to the NAV per Share may widen as a result of non-concurrent
 trading hours between the COMEX and NYSE Arca. 

The Shares may trade at, above or below the NAV per Share. The NAV per Share fluctuates with changes in the market value of the Trust s assets. The trading price of the Shares fluctuates in accordance with changes in the NAV per Share as well as market supply and demand. The amount of the discount or premium in the trading price relative to the NAV per Share may be influenced by non-concurrent
 trading hours between the COMEX and NYSE Arca. While the Shares trade on NYSE Arca until 8:00 PM New York time, liquidity in the global gold market may be reduced after the close of the COMEX at 1:30 PM New York time. As a result, during this time, trading spreads, and the resulting premium or discount, on the Shares may widen. 
 The sale of the Trust s gold to pay expenses at a time of low gold prices could adversely affect the value of the Shares. 

The Trustee sells gold held by the Trust to pay Trust expenses on an as-needed
 basis irrespective of then-current gold prices. The Trust is not actively managed, and no attempt will be made to buy or sell gold to protect against or to take advantage of fluctuations in the price of gold. Consequently, the Trust s gold may be sold at a time when the gold price is low, resulting in a negative effect on the value of the Shares. 
 Shareholders do not have the protections associated with ownership of shares in an investment company registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or the protections afforded by the Commodity Exchange Act. 

The Trust is not registered as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, and is not required to register under such act. Consequently, Shareholders do not have the regulatory protections provided to investors in registered investment companies. The Trust will not hold or trade in commodity futures contracts regulated by the Commodity Exchange Act (the CEA as administered by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (the CFTC ). Furthermore, the Trust is not a commodity pool for purposes of the CEA, and none of the Sponsor, the Trustee or the Marketing Agent is subject to regulation by the CFTC as a commodity pool operator or a commodity trading advisor in connection with the Shares. Consequently, Shareholders do not have the regulatory protections provided to investors in CEA-regulated
 instruments or commodity pools. 
 The Trust may be required to terminate and liquidate at a time that is disadvantageous to Shareholders. 

If the Trust is required to terminate and liquidate, such termination and liquidation could occur at a time which is disadvantageous to Shareholders, such as when gold prices are lower than the gold prices at the time when Shareholders purchased their Shares. In such a case, when the Trust s gold is sold as part of the Trust s liquidation, the resulting proceeds distributed to Shareholders will be less than if gold prices were higher at the time of sale. 

 The liquidity of the Shares may be affected by the withdrawal of Authorized Participants. 

In the event that one of more Authorized Participants which has substantial interests in the Shares withdraws from participation, the liquidity of the Shares will likely decrease, which could adversely affect the market price of the Shares. 

 The lack of an active trading market or a halt in trading of the Shares may result in losses on investment at the time of disposition of the Shares. 

Although Shares are listed for trading on NYSE Arca, it cannot be assumed that an active trading market for the Shares will be maintained. If an investor needs to sell Shares at a time when no active market for Shares exists, or there is a halt in trading of securities generally or of the Shares, this will most likely adversely affect the price the investor receives for the Shares (assuming the investor is able to sell them).

 Redemption orders are subject to postponement, suspension or rejection by the Trustee under certain circumstances. 

The Trustee may, in its discretion, and will when directed by the Sponsor, suspend the right of redemption or postpone the redemption settlement date, (1) for any period during which NYSE Arca is closed other than customary weekend or holiday closings, or trading on NYSE Arca is suspended or restricted, (2) for any period during which an emergency exists as a result of which the delivery, disposal or evaluation of gold is not reasonably practicable, or (3) for such other period as the Sponsor determines to be necessary for the protection of Shareholders. In addition, the Trustee will reject a redemption order if the order is not in proper form as described in the Participant Agreement or if the fulfillment of the order, in the opinion of its counsel, might be unlawful. Any such postponement, suspension or rejection could adversely affect a redeeming Shareholder. For example, the resulting delay may adversely affect the value of the Shareholder s redemption distribution if the price of the Shares declines during the period of the delay. See Creation and Redemption of Shares Redemption Procedures. Under the Trust Indenture, the Sponsor and the Trustee disclaim any liability for any loss or damage that may result from any such suspension or postponement. 

 Shareholders do not have the rights enjoyed by investors in certain other vehicles. 

As interests in an investment trust, the Shares have none of the statutory rights normally associated with the ownership of shares of a corporation (including, for example, the right to bring oppression or derivative actions). In addition, the Shares have limited voting and distribution rights (for example, Shareholders do not have the right to elect directors and will not receive dividends). See Description of the Shares for a description of the limited rights of holders of Shares. 

 An investment in the Shares may be adversely affected by competition from other methods of investing in gold. 

The Trust competes with other financial vehicles, including traditional debt and equity securities issued by companies in the gold industry and other securities backed by or linked to gold, direct investments in gold and investment vehicles similar to the Trust. Market and financial conditions, and other conditions beyond the Sponsor s control, may make it more attractive to invest in other financial vehicles or to invest in gold directly, which could limit the market for the Shares and reduce the liquidity of the Shares. 

 The Trust s obligation to reimburse the Marketing Agent and the Authorized Participants for certain liabilities in the event the Sponsor fails to indemnify such parties could adversely affect an investment in the Shares. 

The Sponsor has agreed to indemnify the Marketing Agent, its partners, directors and officers, and any person who controls the Marketing Agent, and its respective successors and assigns, against any loss, damage, expense, liability or claim that may be incurred by the Marketing Agent in connection with (1) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the registration statement of which this report forms a part (including this report, any preliminary prospectus, any prospectus supplement and any exhibits thereto) or any omission or alleged omission to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading; (2) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact made by the Sponsor with respect to any representations and warranties or any covenants under the Marketing Agent Agreement, or failure of the Sponsor to perform any agreement or covenant therein; (3) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any materials used in connection with the marketing of the Shares; (4) circumstances surrounding the third party allegations relating to patent and contract disputes; or (5) the Marketing Agent s performance of its duties under the Marketing Agent Agreement, and to contribute to payments that the Marketing Agent may be required to make in respect thereof. The Trustee has agreed to reimburse the Marketing Agent, solely from and to the extent of the Trust s assets, for indemnification and contribution due under the preceding sentence to the extent the Sponsor has not paid such amounts directly when due. Under the Participant Agreement, the Sponsor also has agreed to indemnify the Authorized Participants against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act and to contribute to payments that the Authorized Participants may be required to make in respect of such liabilities. The Trustee has agreed to reimburse the Authorized Participants, solely from and to the extent of the Trust s assets, for indemnification and

 contribution amounts due from the Sponsor in respect of such liabilities to the extent the Sponsor has not paid such amounts when due. In the event the Trust is required to pay any such amounts, the Trustee would be required to sell assets of the Trust to cover the amount of any such payment and the NAV of the Trust would be reduced accordingly, thus adversely affecting an investment in the Shares. 

 Under the Trust Indenture, the Sponsor may be able to seek indemnification from the Trust for payments it makes in connection with the Sponsor s activities under the Trust Indenture to the extent its conduct does not disqualify it from receiving such indemnification under the terms of the Trust Indenture. The Sponsor will also be indemnified from the Trust and held harmless against any loss, liability or expense arising under the Marketing Agent Agreement or any Participant Agreement insofar as such loss, liability or expense arises from any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any written statement provided to the Sponsor by the Trustee.

Trust Overview 

SPDR 
 Gold Trust is an investment trust that was formed November 12, 2004. The Trust issues Baskets in exchange for deposits of gold and distributes gold in connection with the redemption of Baskets. The investment objective of the Trust is for the Shares to reflect the performance of the price of gold bullion, less the expenses of the Trust s operations. The Shares are designed to provide investors with a cost effective and convenient way to invest in gold. 

 Gold is held by HSBC Bank plc (the Custodian on behalf of the Trust. 

 As of the date of this quarterly report, Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC, Goldman, Sachs Co., Goldman Sachs Execution Clearing, L.P., HSBC Securities (USA) Inc., J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, Merrill Lynch Professional Clearing Corp., Morgan Stanley Co. LLC, RBC Capital Markets LLC, UBS Securities LLC and Virtu Americas LLC are the only Authorized Participants. An updated list of Authorized Participants can be obtained from the Trustee or the Sponsor.

 Investing in the Shares does not insulate the investor from certain risks, including price volatility. The following chart illustrates the movement in the price of the Shares and NAV of the Shares against the corresponding gold

 price (per 1/10 of an oz. of gold) since the day the Shares first began trading on the NYSE and subsequent transfer to NYSE Arca: 

 Share price NAV v. gold price November 18, 2004 to September 30, 2021 

The divergence of the price of the Shares and NAV of the Shares from the gold price over time reflects the cumulative effect of the Trust expenses that arise if an investment had been held since inception. 

 Critical Accounting Policy 

Valuation of Gold, Definition of Net Asset Value 

The Trustee values the gold held by the Trust and determines the NAV of the Trust on each day the NYSE Arca is open for regular trading, at the earlier of the LBMA Gold Price PM for the day or 12:00 PM New York time. If no LBMA Gold Price PM is announced on a particular evaluation day or if the LBMA Gold Price PM has not been announced by 12:00 PM New York time on a particular evaluation day, the next most recent LBMA Gold Price (AM or PM) is used in the determination of the NAV of the Trust, unless the Trustee, in consultation with the Sponsor, determines that such price is inappropriate to use as the basis for such determination. In the event the Trustee and the Sponsor determine that such price is not an appropriate basis for valuation of the Trust s gold, they will identify an alternative basis for such valuation to be employed by the Trustee. While we believe that the LBMA Gold Price is an appropriate indicator of the value of gold, there are other indicators that are available that could be different than the LBMA Gold Price. The use of such an alternative indicator could result in materially different fair value pricing of the gold in the Trust which could result in different market adjustments or redemption value adjustments of our outstanding redeemable Shares. 

 Once the value of the gold has been determined, the Trustee subtracts all estimated accrued fees, expenses and other liabilities of the Trust from the total value of the gold and all other assets of the Trust (other than any amounts credited to the Trust s reserve account, if established). The resulting figure is the NAV of the Trust. The Trustee determines the NAV per Share by dividing the NAV of the Trust by the number of Shares outstanding as of the close of trading on NYSE Arca. 

 Inspectorate conducts two counts each year of the gold bullion held on behalf of the Trust at the vaults of the Custodian. A complete bar count is conducted once per year and coincides with the Trust s financial year end at September 30 th
. On October 5, 2021, Inspectorate concluded the annual full count of the Trust s gold bullion held by the Custodian. The second count is a random sample count and is conducted at a date which falls within the same financial year and was conducted most recently on April 16, 2021. The results can be found on www.spdrgoldshares.com
. The Sponsor generally visits the vaults of the Custodian twice a year as part of its due diligence procedures.

Table of Contents 
 On the date of inception of the Trust, the Custodian received 30,000 ounces of gold on behalf of the Trust in exchange for 300,000 Shares (3 Baskets). Trading of the Trust s Shares commenced on November 18, 2004. In the year ended September 30, 2021, an additional 67,500,000 Shares (675 Baskets), were created in exchange for 6,325,889 ounces of gold, and 161,600,000 Shares (1,616 Baskets) were redeemed in exchange for 15,146,200 ounces of gold. For accounting purposes, the Trust reflects creations and the gold receivable with respect to such creations on the date of receipt of a notification of a creation but does not deliver Shares until the requisite amount of gold is received. Upon a redemption, the Trust delivers gold upon receipt of Shares. All references in this discussion to gold receivable and gold payable relate to creations and redemptions that had not been completed. These creations and redemptions were completed in the normal course of business, including the receipt and payment of the gold by the Custodian. 

 As at September 30, 2021, the amount of gold owned by the Trust and held by the custodian in its vault was 31,830,401 ounces, 100 of which is allocated gold in the form of London Good Delivery gold bars with a market value of 55,474,022,504 based on the LBMA Gold Price PM on September 30, 2021 (cost 49,227,343,846). 

 As at September 30, 2020, the amount of gold owned by the Trust and held by the custodian in its vault was 40,796,015 ounces, 100 of which is allocated gold in the form of London Good Delivery gold bars with a market value of 76,978,000,158 based on the LBMA Gold Price PM on September 30, 2020 (cost 60,743,750,288). 

 As at September 30, 2019, the amount of gold owned by the Trust and held by the custodian in its vault was 29,737,588 ounces, 100 of which is allocated gold in the form of London Good Delivery gold bars with a market value of 44,169,239,649 based on the LBMA Gold Price PM on September 30, 2019 (cost 39,069,053,854). 

 Cash Flow from Operations 

The Trust had no net cash flow from operations in the years ended September 30, 2021, 2020 and 2019. Cash received in respect of gold sold to pay expenses in the years ended September 30, 2021, 2020 and 2019 was the same as those expenses, resulting in a zero cash balance at September 30, 2021, 2020 and 2019. 

 Off-Balance
 Sheet Arrangements 

The Trust is not a party to any off-balance
 sheet arrangements. 
 Cash Resources and Liquidity 

At September 30, 2021 and 2020 the Trust did not have any cash balances. When selling gold to pay expenses, the Trustee endeavors to sell the exact amount of gold needed to pay expenses in order to minimize the Trust s holdings of assets other than gold. As a consequence, we expect that the Trust will not record any cash flow from its operations and that its cash balance will be zero at the end of each reporting period. 

 Analysis of Movements in the Price of Gold 

As movements in the price of gold are expected to directly affect the price of the Trust s Shares, investors should understand what the recent movements in the price of gold have been. Investors, however, should also be aware that past movements in the gold price are not indicators of future movements. This section identifies recent movements in the gold price.

There have been no changes in accountants and no disagreements with accountants on any matter of accounting principles or practices or financial statement disclosures during the year ended September 30, 2021. 

 Item 9A. Controls and Procedures

Conclusion Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

The Trust maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in its Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial and Accounting Officer of the Sponsor, and to the audit committee of the Board of Directors of the Sponsor, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

 Under the supervision and with the participation of the Principal Executive Officer and the Principal Financial and Accounting Officer of the Sponsor, the Sponsor conducted an evaluation of the Trusts disclosure controls and procedures, as defined under Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e).
 Based on this evaluation, the Principal Executive Officer and the Principal Financial and Accounting Officer of the Sponsor concluded that, as of September 30, 2021, the Trust s disclosure controls and procedures were effective. 
 Change in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

There was no change in the Trust s internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the Trust s most recently completed fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2021 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, these internal controls. 

 Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

The Sponsor s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined under Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f)
 and 15d-15(f).
 The Trust s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the Trust s assets, (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that the Trust s receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with appropriate authorizations; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Trust s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become ineffective because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

 The Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial and Accounting Officer of the Sponsor assessed the effectiveness of the Trust s internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2021. In making this assessment, they used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway 

39 

Table of Contents 
 
 Commission (COSO) in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013). Their assessment included an evaluation of the design of the Trust s internal control over financial reporting and testing of the operational effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting. Based on their assessment and those criteria, the Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial and Accounting Officer of the Sponsor concluded that the Trust maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2021. 

 KPMG LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that audited and reported on the financial statements as of and for the year ended September 30, 2021 included in this Form 10-K,

 We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the statements of financial condition of the Trust, including the schedules of investment, as of September 30, 2021 and 2020, the related statements of operations, cash flows, and changes in net assets for each of the years in the three-year period ended September 30, 2021, and the related notes (collectively, the financial statements), and our report dated November 24, 2021 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements. 

 Basis for Opinion 

The management of World Gold Trust Services, LLC (the Trust s sponsor) is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Trust s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Trust in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

 We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

 Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

An entity s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. An entity s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the entity; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the entity are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the entity; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the entity s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 

 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 

To the Shareholders and the Trustee of SPDR 
 Gold Trust and the Board of Directors of World Gold Trust Services, LLC: 

 Opinion on the Financial Statements 

We have audited the accompanying statements of financial condition of SPDR 
 Gold Trust (the Trust), including the schedules of investment, as of September 30, 2021 and 2020, the related statements of operations, cash flows, and changes in net assets for each of the years in the three-year period ended September 30, 2021 and the related notes (collectively, the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Trust as of September 30, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations, its cash flows, and changes in its net assets for each of the years in the three-year period ended September 30, 2021, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 

 We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Trust s internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) 

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated November 24, 2021 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Trust s internal control over financial reporting. 
 Basis for Opinion 

These financial statements are the responsibility of World Gold Trust Services, LLC (the Trust s sponsor). Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Trust in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

 Critical Audit Matter 

The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. 

 Evaluation of the evidence pertaining to the existence of the gold holdings 

As disclosed in the schedule of investment, as of September 30, 2021, the Trust s market value of gold holdings was 55.5 billion, representing 100 of the Trust s total assets. All of the gold holdings, which were 31.8 million ounces as of September 30, 2021, were held by a third-party custodian (the custodian). 

F-2 

Table of Contents 
 We identified the evaluation of the evidence pertaining to the existence of the gold holdings as a critical audit matter. Given the nature and volume of the gold holdings, subjective auditor judgment was required to evaluate the extent and nature of evidence obtained to assess the quantity of gold held by the custodian as of September 30, 2021. 

 The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls over the Trust s gold holdings process, including controls over (1) the comparison of the Trust s records of gold held to the custodian s records and (2) the approval of gold deposits and withdrawals by the trustee of the Trust. We obtained a schedule directly from the custodian of the Trust s gold holdings held by the custodian as of September 30, 2021. We compared the total ounces on such schedule to the Trust s record of gold holdings. We also attended and observed part of the physical count of the Trust s gold holdings performed at the custodian s location by a third party engaged by the Trust s sponsor. We obtained the physical count result of that third party and reconciled it to both the Trust s and the custodian s records.

under New York law pursuant to a trust indenture (the Trust Indenture ). The fiscal year end for the Trust is September 30 th
. The Trust holds gold and is expected from time to time to issue shares Shares (in minimum denominations of Shares, also referred to as Baskets in exchange for deposits of gold and to distribute gold in connection with redemption of Baskets. The investment objective of the Trust is for the Shares to reflect the performance of the price of gold bullion, less the Trust s expenses. World Gold Trust Services, LLC is the sponsor of the Trust (the Sponsor ). BNY Mellon Asset Servicing, a division of The Bank of New York Mellon, is the trustee of the Trust (the Trustee ). State Street Global Advisors Funds Distributors, LLC is the marketing agent of the Trust (the Marketing Agent ). HSBC Bank plc is the custodian of the Trust (the Custodian ). 

 The Shares trade on the NYSE Arca, Inc. (the NYSE Arca under the symbol GLD , providing investors with an efficient means to obtain market exposure to the price of gold bullion. The Shares are also listed on the Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited, the Mexican Stock Exchange (Bolsa Mexicana de Valores), the Singapore Exchange Limited and the Tokyo Stock Exchange. 

 The Trustee does not actively manage the gold held by the Trust. This means that the Trustee does not sell gold at times when its price is high or acquire gold at low prices in the expectation of future price increases. It also means that the Trustee does not make use of any of the hedging techniques available to professional gold investors to attempt to reduce the risk of losses resulting from price decreases. Any losses sustained by the Trust will adversely affect the value of the Shares.

In determining the net asset value NAV of the Trust, the Trustee values the gold held by the Trust on the basis of the price of an ounce of gold determined by the IBA 3:00 PM auction process LBMA Gold Price PM ), which is an electronic auction, with the imbalance calculated, and the price adjusted in rounds (30 seconds in duration). The auction runs twice daily at 10:30 AM and 3:00 PM London time. The Trustee determines the NAV of the Trust on each day the NYSE Arca is open for regular trading, at the earlier of the LBMA Gold Price PM for the day or 12:00 PM New York time. If no LBMA Gold Price is made on a particular evaluation day or if the LBMA Gold Price has not been announced by 12:00 PM New York time on a particular evaluation day, the next most recent LBMA Gold Price (AM or PM) is used in the determination of the NAV of the Trust, unless the Trustee, in consultation with the Sponsor, determines that such a price is inappropriate to use as the basis for such determination.

Exhibit 4.4 
 DESCRIPTION OF SECURITIES REGISTERED 
 UNDER SECTION 12 OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934 
 The following is a summary of the rights of the SPDR Gold Shares (the Shares of SPDR Gold Trust (the Trust ), which is the only class of securities of the Trust that is registered under Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. 
 GENERAL BNY Mellon Asst Servicing, a division of The
Bank of New York Mellon (the Trustee is authorized under the Trust Indenture (the Trust Indenture dated November 12, 2004, as amended from time to time, between World Gold Trust Services, LLC (the Sponsor and the Trustee to create and issue an unlimited number of Shares. The Shares represent units of fractional undivided beneficial interest in and ownership of the Trust and have no par value. Any creation and issuance of Shares above the amount
registered on the registration statement will require the registration of such additional Shares. DESCRIPTION OF LIMITED RIGHTS 
 The Shares do not represent a traditional investment and Shareholders should not view them as similar to shares of a corporation operating a
business enterprise with management and a board of directors. Shareholders do not have the statutory rights normally associated with the ownership of shares of a corporation, including, for example, the right to bring oppression or
 derivative actions. All Shares are of the same class with equal rights and privileges. Each Share is transferable, is fully paid and non-assessable and entitles the holder to vote on the limited
matters upon which Shareholders may vote under the Trust Indenture. The Shares do not entitle their holders to any conversion or pre-emptive rights, or, except as provided below, any redemption rights or
rights to distributions. DISTRIBUTIONS The Trust
Indenture provides for distributions to Shareholders in only two circumstances. First, if the Trustee and the Sponsor determine that the Trust s cash account balance exceeds the anticipated expenses of the Trust for the next 12 months and the
excess amount is more than 0.01 per Share outstanding, they shall direct the excess amount to be distributed to the Shareholders. Second, if the Trust is terminated and liquidated, the Trustee will distribute to the Shareholders any amounts
remaining after the satisfaction of all outstanding liabilities of the Trust and the establishment of such reserves for applicable taxes, other governmental charges and contingent or future liabilities as the Trustee shall determine. Shareholders of
record on the record date fixed by the Trustee for a distribution will be entitled to receive their pro rata portion of any distribution. VOTING AND
APPROVALS Under the Trust Indenture, Shareholders have no voting rights, except in the following limited circumstances: (i) shareholders holding
at least 662/3 of the Shares outstanding may vote to remove the Trustee; (ii) the Trustee may terminate the Trust upon the agreement of Shareholders owning at least 662/3 of the outstanding Shares; and (iii) certain amendments to the
Trust Indenture require 51 or unanimous consent of the Shareholders. BOOK ENTRY FORM 
 Individual certificates will not be issued for the Shares. Instead, global certificates are deposited by the Trustee with DTC and registered in the name of
Cede Co., as nominee for DTC. The global certificates evidence all of the Shares outstanding at any time. Under the Trust Indenture, Shareholders are limited to: (1) DTC Participants; (2) those who maintain, either directly or
indirectly, a custodial relationship with a DTC Participant, or Indirect Participants; and (3) those banks, brokers, dealers, trust companies and others who hold interests in the Shares through DTC Participants or Indirect Participants. The
Shares are only transferable through the book-entry system of DTC. Shareholders who are not DTC Participants may transfer their Shares through DTC by instructing the DTC Participant holding their Shares (or by instructing the Indirect Participant or
other entity through which their Shares are held) to transfer the Shares. Transfers are made in accordance with standard securities industry practice.
