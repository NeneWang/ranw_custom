 PART I 
 The terms we, our, us, Atmos Energy and the Company refer to Atmos Energy Corporation and its subsidiaries, unless the context suggests otherwise. 

ITEM 1. Business. 
 Overview and Strategy 
 Atmos Energy Corporation, headquartered in Dallas, Texas, and incorporated in Texas and Virginia, is the country s largest natural-gas-only distributor based on number of customers. We safely deliver reliable, affordable, efficient and abundant natural gas through regulated sales and transportation arrangements to over three million residential, commercial, public authority and industrial customers in eight states located primarily in the South. We also operate one of the largest intrastate pipelines in Texas based on miles of pipe. 
 Atmos Energy's vision is to be the safest provider of natural gas services. We intend to achieve this vision by: 
 operating our business exceptionally well 
 investing in safety, innovation and environmental sustainability, and 
 achieving superior financial results. 
 Since 2011, our operating strategy has focused on modernizing our distribution and transmission system while reducing regulatory lag. This operating strategy has allowed us to increase our capital expenditures approximately 13 percent per year to improve safety and reliability and to reduce methane emissions from our system. 
 Our core values include focusing on our employees and customers while conducting our business with honesty and integrity. We continue to strengthen our culture through ongoing communications with our employees and enhanced employee training. 
 Operating Segments 
 As of September 30, 2021, we manage and review our consolidated operations through the following reportable segments: 
 The distribution segment is primarily comprised of our regulated natural gas distribution and related sales operations in eight states. 
 The pipeline and storage segment is comprised primarily of the pipeline and storage operations of our Atmos Pipeline-Texas division and our natural gas transmission operations in Louisiana. 
 Distribution Segment Overview 
 The following table summarizes key information about our six regulated natural gas distribution divisions, presented in order of total rate base. 
 Division Service Areas Communities Served Customer Meters Mid-Tex Texas, including the Dallas/Fort Worth Metroplex 550 1,791,482 Kentucky/Mid-States Kentucky 230 183,937 Tennessee 159,461 Virginia 24,746 Louisiana Louisiana 270 373,207 West Texas Amarillo, Lubbock, Midland 80 326,419 Mississippi Mississippi 110 272,993 Colorado-Kansas Colorado 170 125,241 Kansas 139,763 
 We operate in our service areas under terms of non-exclusive franchise agreements granted by the various cities and towns that we serve. At September 30, 2021, we held 1,025 franchises having terms generally ranging from five to 35 years. A 
 4 

Table of Contents 

 significant number of our franchises expire each year, which require renewal prior to the end of their terms. Historically, we have successfully renewed these franchises and believe that we will continue to be able to renew our franchises as they expire. 
 Revenues in this operating segment are established by regulatory authorities in the states in which we operate. These rates are intended to be sufficient to cover the costs of conducting business, including a reasonable return on invested capital. In addition, we transport natural gas for others through our distribution systems. 
 Rates established by regulatory authorities often include cost adjustment mechanisms for costs that (i) are subject to significant price fluctuations compared to our other costs, (ii) represent a large component of our cost of service and (iii) are generally outside our control. 
 Purchased gas cost adjustment mechanisms represent a traditional and common form of cost adjustment mechanism. Purchased gas cost adjustment mechanisms provide a method of recovering purchased gas costs on an ongoing basis without filing a rate case because they provide a dollar-for-dollar offset to increases or decreases in the cost of natural gas. Therefore, although substantially all of our distribution operating revenues fluctuate with the cost of gas that we purchase, distribution operating income is generally not affected by fluctuations in the cost of gas. 
 Additionally, some jurisdictions have performance-based ratemaking adjustments to provide incentives to minimize purchased gas costs through improved storage management and use of financial instruments to reduce volatility in gas costs. Under the performance-based ratemaking adjustments, purchased gas costs savings are shared between the Company and its customers. 
 Our supply of natural gas is provided by a variety of suppliers, including independent producers and marketers. The gas is delivered into our systems by various pipeline companies, withdrawals of gas from proprietary and contracted storage assets and base load and peaking arrangements, as needed. 
 Supply arrangements consist of both base load and peaking quantities and are contracted from our suppliers on a firm basis with various terms at market prices. Base load quantities are those that flow at a constant level throughout the month and peaking quantities provide the flexibility to change daily quantities to match increases or decreases in requirements related to weather conditions. 
 Except for local production purchases, we select our natural gas suppliers through a competitive bidding process by periodically requesting proposals from suppliers. We select these suppliers based on their ability to reliably deliver gas supply to our designated firm pipeline receipt points at the lowest reasonable cost. Major suppliers during fiscal 2021 were Castleton Commodities Merchant Trading L.P., Cima Energy, LP, Concord Energy LLC, EnLink Gas Marketing LP, ETC Gas Marketing LTD, Hartree Partners, L.P., Kinder Morgan Texas Pipeline LLC, Symmetry Energy Solutions, LLC, Targa Gas Marketing LLC and Twin Eagle Resources Management, LLC. 
 The combination of base load and peaking agreements, coupled with the withdrawal of gas held in storage, allows us the flexibility to adjust to changes in weather, which minimizes our need to enter into long-term firm commitments. We estimate our peak-day availability of natural gas supply to be approximately 4.4 Bcf. The peak-day demand for our distribution operations in fiscal 2021 was on February 14, 2021, when sales to customers reached approximately 4.3 Bcf. 
 Currently, our distribution divisions utilize 35 pipeline transportation companies, both interstate and intrastate, to transport our natural gas. The pipeline transportation agreements are firm and many of them have pipeline no-notice storage service, which provides for daily balancing between system requirements and nominated flowing supplies. These agreements have been negotiated with the shortest term necessary while still maintaining our right of first refusal. The natural gas supply for our Mid-Tex Division is delivered primarily by our APT Division. 
 To maintain our deliveries to high priority customers, we have the ability, and have exercised our right, to interrupt or curtail service to certain customers pursuant to contracts and applicable state regulations or statutes. Our customers demand on our system is not necessarily indicative of our ability to meet current or anticipated market demands or immediate delivery requirements because of factors such as the physical limitations of gathering, storage and transmission systems, the duration and severity of cold weather, the availability of gas reserves from our suppliers, the ability to purchase additional supplies on a short-term basis and actions by federal and state regulatory authorities. Interruption and curtailment rights provide us the flexibility to meet the human-needs requirements of our customers on a reliable basis. Priority allocations imposed by federal and state regulatory agencies, as well as other factors beyond our control, may affect our ability to meet the demands of some of our customers. 
 Pipeline and Storage Segment Overview 
 Our pipeline and storage segment consists of the pipeline and storage operations of APT and our natural gas transmission operations in Louisiana. APT is one of the largest intrastate pipeline operations in Texas with a heavy concentration in the established natural gas-producing areas of central, northern and eastern Texas, extending into or near the major producing areas of the Barnett Shale, the Texas Gulf Coast and the Permian Basin of West Texas. Through its system, APT provides transportation and storage services to our Mid-Tex Division, other third party local distribution companies, industrial and 
 5 

Table of Contents 

 electric generation customers, marketers and producers. As part of its pipeline operations, APT owns and operates five underground storage reservoirs in Texas. 
 Revenues earned from transportation and storage services for APT are subject to traditional ratemaking governed by the RRC. Rates are updated through periodic filings made under Texas GRIP. GRIP allows us to include in our rate base annually approved capital costs incurred in the prior calendar year provided that we file a complete rate case at least once every five years; the most recent of which was completed in August 2017. APT s existing regulatory mechanisms allow certain transportation and storage services to be provided under market-based rates. 
 Our natural gas transmission operations in Louisiana are comprised of a 21-mile pipeline located in the New Orleans, Louisiana area that is primarily used to aggregate gas supply for our distribution division in Louisiana under a long-term contract and, on a more limited basis, to third parties. The demand fee charged to our Louisiana distribution division for these services is subject to regulatory approval by the Louisiana Public Service Commission. We also manage two asset management plans in Louisiana that serve distribution affiliates of the Company, which have been approved by applicable state regulatory commissions. Generally, these asset management plans require us to share with our distribution customers a significant portion of the cost savings earned from these arrangements. 
 Ratemaking Activity 
 Overview 
 The method of determining regulated rates varies among the states in which our regulated businesses operate. The regulatory authorities have the responsibility of ensuring that utilities in their jurisdictions operate in the best interests of customers while providing utility companies the opportunity to earn a reasonable return on their investment. Generally, each regulatory authority reviews rate requests and establishes a rate structure intended to generate revenue sufficient to cover the costs of conducting business, including a reasonable return on invested capital. 
 Our rate strategy focuses on reducing or eliminating regulatory lag, obtaining adequate returns and providing stable, predictable margins, which benefit both our customers and the Company. As a result of our ratemaking efforts in recent years, Atmos Energy has: 
 Formula rate mechanisms in place in four states that provide for an annual rate review and adjustment to rates. 
 Infrastructure programs in place in all of our states that provide for an annual adjustment to rates for qualifying capital expenditures. Through our annual formula rate mechanisms and infrastructure programs, we have the ability to recover approximately 90 percent of our capital expenditures within six months and substantially all of our capital expenditures within twelve months. 
 Authorization in tariffs, statute or commission rules that allows us to defer certain elements of our cost of service such as depreciation, ad valorem taxes and pension costs, until they are included in rates. 
 WNA mechanisms in seven states that serve to minimize the effects of weather on approximately 96 percent of our distribution residential and commercial revenues. 
 The ability to recover the gas cost portion of bad debts in five states.

 Although substantial progress has been made in recent years to improve rate design and recovery of investment across our service areas, we are continuing to seek improvements in rate design to address cost variations and pursue tariffs that reduce regulatory lag associated with investments. Further, potential changes in federal energy policy, federal safety regulations and changing economic conditions will necessitate continued vigilance by the Company and our regulators in meeting the challenges presented by these external factors. 
 Recent Ratemaking Activity 
 The amounts described in the following sections represent the annual operating income that was requested or received in each rate filing, which may not necessarily reflect the stated amount referenced in the final order, as certain operating costs may have changed as a result of the commission's or other governmental authority's final ruling. The following table summarizes the annualized ratemaking outcomes we implemented in each of the last three fiscal years. 
 Annual Increase (Decrease) to Operating Income For the Fiscal Year Ended September 30 Rate Action 2021 2020 2019 (In thousands) Annual formula rate mechanisms 181,459 160,857 114,810 Rate case filings 5,119 (1,057) 1,656 Other ratemaking activity (877) 353 214 185,701 160,153 116,680 
 Additionally, the ratemaking outcomes for the rate activity in fiscal 2021 include the refund of excess deferred income taxes resulting from previously enacted tax reform legislation and do not reflect the true economic benefit of the outcomes because they do not include the corresponding income tax benefit. Excluding these amounts, our total fiscal 2021 rate outcomes for ratemaking activities were 226.2 million. 
 
 The following ratemaking efforts seeking 56.5 million in annual operating income were initiated during fiscal 2021 but had not been completed or implemented as of September 30, 2021:

 Our recent ratemaking activity is discussed in greater detail below. 
 Annual Formula Rate Mechanisms 
 As an instrument to reduce regulatory lag, formula rate mechanisms allow us to refresh our rates on an annual basis without filing a formal rate case. However, these filings still involve discovery by the appropriate regulatory authorities prior to the final determination of rates under these mechanisms. We currently have specific infrastructure programs in substantially all of our distribution divisions with tariffs in place to permit the investment associated with these programs to have their surcharge rate adjusted annually to recover approved capital costs incurred in a prior test-year period. The following table summarizes our annual formula rate mechanisms by state.

 (1) Infrastructure mechanisms in Texas, Louisiana and Tennessee allow for the deferral of all expenses associated with capital expenditures incurred pursuant to these rules, which primarily consists of interest, depreciation and other taxes (Texas only), until the next rate proceeding (rate case or annual rate filing), at which time investment and costs would be recoverable through base rates.

 Rate Case Filings 
 A rate case is a formal request from Atmos Energy to a regulatory authority to increase rates that are charged to customers. Rate cases may also be initiated when the regulatory authorities request us to justify our rates. This process is referred to as a show cause action. Adequate rates are intended to provide for recovery of the Company s costs as well as a reasonable rate of return to our shareholders and ensure that we continue to safely deliver reliable, reasonably priced natural gas service to our customers.

 Other Regulation 
 We are regulated by various state or local public utility authorities. We are also subject to regulation by the United States Department of Transportation with respect to safety requirements in the operation and maintenance of our transmission and distribution facilities. In addition, our operations are also subject to various state and federal laws regulating environmental matters. From time to time, we receive inquiries regarding various environmental matters. We believe that our properties and operations comply with, and are operated in conformity with, applicable safety and environmental statutes and regulations. There are no administrative or judicial proceedings arising under environmental quality statutes pending or known to be contemplated by governmental agencies which would have a material adverse effect on us or our operations. The Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA), within the U.S. Department of Transportation, develops and enforces regulations for the safe, reliable and environmentally sound operation of the pipeline transportation system. The PHMSA pipeline safety statutes provide for states to assume safety authority over intrastate natural transmission and distribution gas pipelines. State pipeline safety programs are responsible for adopting and enforcing the federal and state pipeline safety regulations for intrastate natural gas transmission and distribution pipelines. 
 The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) allows, pursuant to Section 311 of the Natural Gas Policy Act (NGPA), gas transportation services through our APT assets on behalf of interstate pipelines or local distribution companies served by interstate pipelines, without subjecting these assets to the jurisdiction of the FERC under the NGPA. Additionally, the FERC has regulatory authority over the use and release of interstate pipeline and storage capacity. The FERC also has authority to detect and prevent market manipulation and to enforce compliance with FERC s other rules, policies and orders by companies engaged in the sale, purchase, transportation or storage of natural gas in interstate commerce. We have taken what we believe are the necessary and appropriate steps to comply with these regulations. 
 The SEC and the Commodities Futures Trading Commission, pursuant to the Dodd Frank Act, established numerous regulations relating to U.S. financial markets. We enacted procedures and modified existing business practices and contractual arrangements to comply with such regulations. There are, however, some rulemaking proceedings that have not yet been finalized, including those relating to capital and margin rules for (non cleared) swaps. We do not expect these rules to directly impact our business practices or collateral requirements. However, depending on the substance of these final rules, in addition to certain international regulatory requirements still under development that are similar to Dodd Frank, our swap counterparties could be subject to additional and potentially significant capitalization requirements. These regulations could motivate counterparties to increase our collateral requirements or cash postings. 
 Competition 
 Although our regulated distribution operations are not currently in significant direct competition with any other distributors of natural gas to residential and commercial customers within our service areas, we do compete with other natural gas suppliers and suppliers of alternative fuels for sales to industrial customers. We compete in all aspects of our business with alternative energy sources, including, in particular, electricity. Electric utilities offer electricity as a rival energy source and compete for the space heating, water heating and cooking markets. Promotional incentives, improved equipment efficiencies and promotional rates all contribute to the acceptability of electrical equipment. The principal means to compete against alternative fuels is lower prices, and natural gas historically has maintained its price advantage in the residential, commercial and industrial markets. 
 Our pipeline and storage operations have historically faced competition from other existing intrastate pipelines seeking to provide or arrange transportation, storage and other services for customers. In the last few years, several new pipelines have been completed, which has increased the level of competition in this segment of our business. 
 Employees 
 The Corporate Responsibility, Sustainability, and Safety Committee of the Board of Directors oversees matters relating to equal employment opportunities, diversity, and inclusion; human workplace rights; employee health and safety; and the Company s vision, values, and culture. It also assists management in integrating responsibility and sustainability into strategic business activities to create long-term shareholder value. 
 Our culture respects and appreciates inclusion and diversity. Thus, we strive to have a workforce that reflects the unique 1,400 communities that we serve. At September 30, 2021, we had 4,684 employees, substantially unchanged from last year. We monitor our workforce data on a calendar year basis. As of December 31, 2020, 61 percent of our employees worked in field roles and 39 percent worked in support/shared services roles. No employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement.

To recruit and hire individuals with a variety of skills, talents, backgrounds and experiences, we value and cultivate our strong relationships with hundreds of community and diversity outreach sources. We also target jobs fairs including those focused on minority, veteran and women candidates and partner with local colleges and universities to identify and recruit qualified applicants in each of the cities and towns we serve. Over the last five calendar years, we hired over 2,000 employees. Our culture is also reflected in our employee benefits. The physical, mental and financial health of our employees and their families is a top priority for the Company, which is why we have a strong, competitive benefits program to help employees and their families manage and protect their health, wealth and time. 

We perform succession planning annually to ensure that we develop and sustain a strong bench of talent capable of performing at the highest levels. Not only is talent identified, but potential paths of development are discussed to ensure that employees have an opportunity to build their skills and are well-prepared for future roles. The strength of our succession planning process is evident through our long history of promoting our leaders from within the organization.

 ITEM 1A. Risk Factors. 
 Our financial and operating results are subject to a number of risk factors, many of which are not within our control. Investors should carefully consider the following discussion of risk factors as well as other information appearing in this report. These factors include the following, which are organized by category: 
 Regulatory and Legislative Risks 
 We are subject to federal, state and local regulations that affect our operations and financial results. 
 We are subject to regulatory oversight from various federal, state and local regulatory authorities in the eight states that we serve. Therefore, our returns are continuously monitored and are subject to challenge for their reasonableness by the appropriate regulatory authorities or other third-party intervenors. In the normal course of business, as a regulated entity, we often need to place assets in service and establish historical test periods before rate cases that seek to adjust our allowed returns to recover that investment can be filed. Further, the regulatory review process can be lengthy in the context of traditional ratemaking. Because of this process, we suffer the negative financial effects of having placed assets in service without the benefit of rate relief, which is commonly referred to as regulatory lag. 
 However, in the last several years, a number of regulatory authorities in the states we serve have approved rate mechanisms that provide for annual adjustments to rates that allow us to recover the cost of investments made to replace existing infrastructure or reflect changes in our cost of service. These mechanisms work to effectively reduce the regulatory lag inherent in the ratemaking process. However, regulatory lag could significantly increase if the regulatory authorities modify or terminate these rate mechanisms. The regulatory process also involves the risk that regulatory authorities may (i) review our purchases of natural gas and adjust the amount of our gas costs that we pass through to our customers or (ii) limit the costs we may have incurred from our cost of service that can be recovered from customers. 
 We are also subject to laws, regulations and other legal requirements enacted or adopted by federal, state and local governmental authorities relating to protection of the environment and health and safety matters, including those that govern discharges of substances into the air and water, the management and disposal of hazardous substances and waste, the clean-up of contaminated sites, groundwater quality and availability, plant and wildlife protection, as well as work practices related to employee health and safety. Environmental legislation also requires that our facilities, sites and other properties associated with our operations be operated, maintained, abandoned and reclaimed to the satisfaction of applicable regulatory authorities. Failure to comply with these laws, regulations, permits and licenses may expose us to fines, penalties or interruptions in our operations that could be significant to our financial results. In addition, existing environmental regulations may be revised or our operations may become subject to new regulations. 
 Some of our operations are subject to increased federal regulatory oversight that could affect our operations and financial results. 
 FERC has regulatory authority over some of our operations, including the use and release of interstate pipeline and storage capacity. FERC has adopted rules designed to prevent market power abuse and market manipulation and to promote compliance with FERC s other rules, policies and orders by companies engaged in the sale, purchase, transportation or storage of natural gas in interstate commerce. These rules carry increased penalties for violations. Although we have taken steps to structure current and future transactions to comply with applicable current FERC regulations, changes in FERC regulations or their interpretation by FERC or additional regulations issued by FERC in the future could also adversely affect our business, financial condition or financial results. 
 We may experience increased federal, state and local regulation of the safety of our operations. 
 The safety and protection of the public, our customers and our employees is our top priority. We constantly monitor and maintain our pipeline and distribution systems to ensure that natural gas is delivered safely, reliably and efficiently through our network of more than 75,000 miles of distribution and transmission lines. As in recent years, natural gas distribution and pipeline companies are continuing to encounter increasing federal, state and local oversight of the safety of their operations. Although we believe these are costs ultimately recoverable through our rates, the costs of complying with new laws and regulations may have at least a short-term adverse impact on our operating costs and financial results. 
 Greenhouse gas emissions or other legislation or regulations intended to address climate change could increase our operating costs, adversely affecting our financial results, growth, cash flows and results of operations. 
 Six of the eight states in which we operate have passed legislation to block attempts by local governments to limit the types of energy available to customers. However, federal, regional and/or state legislative and/or regulatory initiatives may attempt to control or limit the causes of climate change, including greenhouse gas emissions, such as carbon dioxide and methane. Such laws or regulations could impose costs tied to greenhouse gas emissions, operational requirements or restrictions, or additional charges to fund energy efficiency activities. They could also provide a cost advantage to alternative energy sources, impose 
 14 

Table of Contents 

 costs or restrictions on end users of natural gas, or result in other costs or requirements, such as costs associated with the adoption of new infrastructure and technology to respond to new mandates. The focus on climate change could adversely impact the reputation of fossil fuel products or services. The occurrence of the foregoing events could put upward pressure on the cost of natural gas relative to other energy sources, increase our costs and the prices we charge to customers, reduce the demand for natural gas or cause fuel switching to other energy sources, and impact the competitive position of natural gas and the ability to serve new or existing customers, adversely affecting our business, results of operations and cash flows. 
 Operational Risks 
 We may incur significant costs and liabilities resulting from pipeline integrity and other similar programs and related repairs. 
 PHMSA requires pipeline operators to develop integrity management programs to comprehensively evaluate certain areas along their pipelines and to take additional measures to protect pipeline segments located in high consequence areas where a leak or rupture could potentially do the most harm. As a pipeline operator, the Company is required to: 
 perform ongoing assessments of pipeline integrity; 
 identify and characterize applicable threats to pipeline segments that could impact a high consequence area 
 improve data collection, integration and analysis; 
 repair and remediate the pipeline as necessary; and 
 implement preventative and mitigating actions. 
 The Company incurs significant costs associated with its compliance with existing PHMSA and comparable state regulations. Although we believe these are costs ultimately recoverable through our rates, the costs of complying with new laws and regulations may have at least a short-term adverse impact on our operating costs and financial results. For example, the adoption of new regulations requiring more comprehensive or stringent safety standards could require installation of new or modified safety controls, new capital projects, or accelerated maintenance programs, all of which could require a potentially significant increase in operating costs. 
 Distributing, transporting and storing natural gas involve risks that may result in accidents and additional operating costs. 
 Our operations involve a number of hazards and operating risks inherent in storing and transporting natural gas that could affect the public safety and reliability of our distribution system. While Atmos Energy, with the support from each of its regulatory commissions, is accelerating the replacement of pipeline infrastructure, operating issues such as leaks, accidents, equipment problems and incidents, including explosions and fire, could result in legal liability, repair and remediation costs, increased operating costs, significant increased capital expenditures, regulatory fines and penalties and other costs and a loss of customer confidence. We maintain liability and property insurance coverage in place for many of these hazards and risks. However, because some of our transmission pipeline and storage facilities are near or are in populated areas, any loss of human life or adverse financial results resulting from such events could be large. If these events were not fully covered by our general liability and property insurance, which policies are subject to certain limits and deductibles, our operations or financial results could be adversely affected. 
 If contracted gas supplies, interstate pipeline and/or storage services are not available or delivered in a timely manner, our ability to meet our customers natural gas requirements may be impaired and our financial condition may be adversely affected. 
 In order to meet our customers annual and seasonal natural gas demands, we must obtain a sufficient supply of natural gas, interstate pipeline capacity and storage capacity. If we are unable to obtain these, either from our suppliers inability to deliver the contracted commodity or the inability to secure replacement quantities, our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected. If a substantial disruption to or reduction in interstate natural gas pipelines transmission and storage capacity occurred due to operational failures or disruptions, legislative or regulatory actions, hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, extreme cold weather, terrorist or cyber-attacks or acts of war, our operations or financial results could be adversely affected. 
 Our operations are subject to increased competition. 
 In residential and commercial customer markets, our distribution operations compete with other energy products, such as electricity and propane. Our primary product competition is with electricity for heating, water heating and cooking. Increases in the price of natural gas could negatively impact our competitive position by decreasing the price benefits of natural gas to the consumer. This could adversely impact our business if our customer growth slows or if our customers further conserve their use of gas, resulting in reduced gas purchases and customer billings. 
 In the case of industrial customers, such as manufacturing plants, adverse economic conditions, including higher gas costs, could cause these customers to use alternative sources of energy, such as electricity, or bypass our systems in favor of special 
 15 

Table of Contents 

 competitive contracts with lower per-unit costs. Our pipeline and storage operations historically have faced limited competition from other existing intrastate pipelines and gas marketers seeking to provide or arrange transportation, storage and other services for customers. However, in the last few years, several new pipelines have been completed, which has increased the level of competition in this segment of our business. 
 Adverse weather conditions could affect our operations or financial results. 
 We have weather-normalized rates for approximately 96 percent of our residential and commercial revenues in our distribution operations, which substantially mitigates the adverse effects of warmer-than-normal weather for meters in those service areas. However, there is no assurance that we will continue to receive such regulatory protection from adverse weather in our rates in the future. The loss of such weather-normalized rates could have an adverse effect on our operations and financial results. In addition, our operating results may continue to vary somewhat with the actual temperatures during the winter heating season. Additionally, sustained cold weather could challenge our ability to adequately meet customer demand in our operations. 
 The operations and financial results of the Company could be adversely impacted as a result of climate change. 
 As climate change occurs, our businesses could be adversely impacted, although we believe it is likely that any such resulting impacts would occur very gradually over a long period of time and thus would be difficult to quantify with any degree of specificity. To the extent climate change results in temperatures that differ materially from temperatures we are currently experiencing, financial results could be adversely affected through lower gas volumes and revenues. Climate change could also cause shifts in population, including customers moving away from our service territories. 
 It could also result in more frequent and more severe weather events, such as hurricanes and tornadoes, which could increase our costs to repair damaged facilities and restore service to our customers or impact the cost of gas. If we were unable to deliver natural gas to our customers, our financial results would be impacted by lost revenues, and we generally would have to seek approval from regulators to recover restoration costs. To the extent we would be unable to recover those costs, or if higher rates resulting from our recovery of such costs would result in reduced demand for our services, our future business, financial condition or financial results could be adversely impacted. 
 The inability to continue to hire, train and retain operational, technical and managerial personnel could adversely affect our results of operations. 
 Although the average age of the employee base of Atmos Energy is not significantly changing year over year, there are still a number of employees who will become eligible to retire within the next five to 10 years. If we were unable to hire appropriate personnel or contractors to fill future needs, the Company could encounter operating challenges and increased costs, primarily due to a loss of knowledge, errors due to inexperience or the lengthy time period typically required to adequately train replacement personnel. In addition, higher costs could result from loss of productivity or increased safety compliance issues. The inability to hire, train and retain new operational, technical and managerial personnel adequately and to transfer institutional knowledge and expertise could adversely affect our ability to manage and operate our business. If we were unable to hire, train and retain appropriately qualified personnel, our results of operations could be adversely affected. 
 Increased dependence on technology may hinder the Company s business operations and adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations if such technologies fail. 
 Over the last several years, the Company has implemented or acquired a variety of technological tools including both Company-owned information technology and technological services provided by outside parties. These tools and systems support critical functions including, scheduling and dispatching of service technicians, automated meter reading systems, customer care and billing, operational plant logistics, management reporting, and external financial reporting. The failure of these or other similarly important technologies, or the Company s inability to have these technologies supported, updated, expanded, or integrated into other technologies, could hinder its business operations and adversely impact its financial condition and results of operations. 
 Although the Company has, when possible, developed alternative sources of technology and built redundancy into its computer networks and tools, there can be no assurance that these efforts would protect against all potential issues related to the loss of any such technologies. 
 Cyber-attacks or acts of cyber-terrorism could disrupt our business operations and information technology systems or result in the loss or exposure of confidential or sensitive customer, employee or Company information. 
 Our business operations and information technology systems may be vulnerable to an attack by individuals or organizations intending to disrupt our business operations and information technology systems, even though the Company has implemented policies, procedures and controls to prevent and detect these activities. We use our information technology systems to manage our distribution and intrastate pipeline and storage operations and other business processes. Disruption of those systems could adversely impact our ability to safely deliver natural gas to our customers, operate our pipeline and storage 
 16 

Table of Contents 

 systems or serve our customers timely. Accordingly, if such an attack or act of terrorism were to occur, our operations and financial results could be adversely affected. 
 In addition, we use our information technology systems to protect confidential or sensitive customer, employee and Company information developed and maintained in the normal course of our business. Any attack on such systems that would result in the unauthorized release of customer, employee or other confidential or sensitive data could have a material adverse effect on our business reputation, increase our costs and expose us to additional material legal claims and liability. Even though we have insurance coverage in place for many of these cyber-related risks, if such an attack or act of terrorism were to occur, our operations and financial results could be adversely affected to the extent not fully covered by such insurance coverage. 
 Natural disasters, terrorist activities or other significant events could adversely affect our operations or financial results. 
 Natural disasters are always a threat to our assets and operations. In addition, the threat of terrorist activities could lead to increased economic instability and volatility in the price of natural gas that could affect our operations. Also, companies in our industry may face a heightened risk of exposure to actual acts of terrorism, which could subject our operations to increased risks. As a result, the availability of insurance covering such risks may become more limited, which could increase the risk that an event could adversely affect our operations or financial results. 
 Financial, Economic and Market Risks 
 Our growth in the future may be limited by the nature of our business, which requires extensive capital spending. 
 Our operations are capital-intensive. We must make significant capital expenditures on a long-term basis to modernize our distribution and transmission system and to comply with the safety rules and regulations issued by the regulatory authorities responsible for the service areas we operate. In addition, we must continually build new capacity to serve the growing needs of the communities we serve. The magnitude of these expenditures may be affected by a number of factors, including new regulations, the general state of the economy and weather. 
 The liquidity required to fund our working capital, capital expenditures and other cash needs is provided from a combination of internally generated cash flows and external debt and equity financing. The cost and availability of borrowing funds from third party lenders or issuing equity is dependent on the liquidity of the credit markets, interest rates and other market conditions. This in turn may limit the amount of funds we can invest in our infrastructure. 
 The Company is dependent on continued access to the credit and capital markets to execute our business strategy. 
 Our long-term debt is currently rated as investment grade by Standard Poor s Corporation and Moody s Investors Service, Inc. Similar to most companies, we rely upon access to both short-term and long-term credit and capital markets to satisfy our liquidity requirements. If adverse credit conditions were to cause a significant limitation on our access to the private credit and public capital markets, we could see a reduction in our liquidity. A significant reduction in our liquidity could in turn trigger a negative change in our ratings outlook or even a reduction in our credit ratings by one or more of the credit rating agencies. Such a downgrade could further limit our access to private credit and/or public capital markets and increase our costs of borrowing. 
 While we believe we can meet our capital requirements from our operations and the sources of financing available to us, we can provide no assurance that we will continue to be able to do so in the future, especially if the market price of natural gas increases significantly. The future effects on our business, liquidity and financial results of a deterioration of current conditions in the credit and capital markets could be material and adverse to us, both in the ways described above or in other ways that we do not currently anticipate. 
 We are exposed to market risks that are beyond our control, which could adversely affect our financial results. 
 We are subject to market risks beyond our control, including (i) commodity price volatility caused by market supply and demand dynamics, counterparty performance or counterparty creditworthiness, and (ii) interest rate risk. We are generally insulated from commodity price risk through our purchased gas cost mechanisms. With respect to interest rate risk, we have been operating in a relatively low interest-rate environment in recent years compared to historical norms for both short and long-term interest rates. However, increases in interest rates could adversely affect our future financial results to the extent that we do not recover our actual interest expense in our rates. 
 The concentration of our operations in the State of Texas exposes our operations and financial results to economic conditions, weather patterns and regulatory decisions in Texas. 
 Approximately 70 percent of our consolidated operations are located in the State of Texas. This concentration of our business in Texas means that our operations and financial results may be significantly affected by changes in the Texas economy in general, weather patterns and regulatory decisions by state and local regulatory authorities in Texas. 
 A deterioration in economic conditions could adversely affect our customers and negatively impact our financial results.

 Any adverse changes in economic conditions in the United States, especially in the states in which we operate, could adversely affect the financial resources of many domestic households. As a result, our customers could seek to use less gas and it may be more difficult for them to pay their gas bills. This would likely lead to slower collections and higher than normal levels of accounts receivable. This, in turn, could increase our financing requirements. Additionally, should economic conditions deteriorate, our industrial customers could seek alternative energy sources, which could result in lower transportation volumes. 
 Increased gas costs could adversely impact our customer base and customer collections and increase our level of indebtedness. 
 Rapid increases in the costs of purchased gas would cause us to experience a significant increase in short-term or long-term debt. We must pay suppliers for gas when it is purchased, which can be significantly in advance of when these costs may be recovered through the collection of monthly customer bills for gas delivered. Increases in purchased gas costs also slow our natural gas distribution collection efforts as customers are more likely to delay the payment of their gas bills, leading to higher than normal accounts receivable. This could result in higher short-term debt levels, greater collection efforts and increased bad debt expense. 
 The costs of providing health care benefits, pension and postretirement health care benefits and related funding requirements may increase substantially. 
 We provide health care benefits, a cash-balance pension plan and postretirement health care benefits to eligible full-time employees. The costs of providing health care benefits to our employees could significantly increase over time due to rapidly increasing health care inflation, and any future legislative changes related to the provision of health care benefits. The impact of additional costs which are likely to be passed on to the Company is difficult to measure at this time. 
 The costs of providing a cash-balance pension plan to eligible full-time employees prior to 2011 and postretirement health care benefits to eligible full-time employees and related funding requirements could be influenced by changes in the market value of the assets funding our pension and postretirement health care plans. Any significant declines in the value of these investments due to sustained declines in equity markets or a reduction in bond yields could increase the costs of our pension and postretirement health care plans and related funding requirements in the future. Further, our costs of providing such benefits and related funding requirements are also subject to a number of factors, including (i) changing demographics, including longer life expectancy of beneficiaries and an expected increase in the number of eligible former employees over the next five to ten years; (ii) various actuarial calculations and assumptions which may differ materially from actual results due primarily to changing market and economic conditions, including changes in interest rates, and higher or lower withdrawal rates; and (iii) future government regulation. 
 The costs to the Company of providing these benefits and related funding requirements could also increase materially in the future, should there be a material reduction in the amount of the recovery of these costs through our rates or should significant delays develop in the timing of the recovery of such costs, which could adversely affect our financial results. 
 The outbreak of COVID-19 or any other pandemic and their impact on business and economic conditions could negatively affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
 The scale and scope of the COVID-19 outbreak, the resulting pandemic, any other future pandemic, and their impact on the economy and financial markets could adversely affect the Company s business, results of operations and financial condition. Regarding COVID-19, as an essential business, the Company continues to provide natural gas services and has implemented business continuity and emergency response plans to continue to provide natural gas services to customers and support the Company s operations, while taking health and safety measures such as implementing worker distancing measures and using a remote workforce where possible. However, there is no assurance that the continued spread of COVID-19 and efforts to contain the virus will not materially impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.

 ITEM 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 

INTRODUCTION 
 This section provides management s discussion of the financial condition, changes in financial condition and results of operations of Atmos Energy Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries with specific information on results of operations and liquidity and capital resources. It includes management s interpretation of our financial results, the factors affecting these results, the major factors expected to affect future operating results and future investment and financing plans. This discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto. 
 Several factors exist that could influence our future financial performance, some of which are described in Item 1A above, Risk Factors . They should be considered in connection with evaluating forward-looking statements contained in this report or otherwise made by or on behalf of us since these factors could cause actual results and conditions to differ materially from those set out in such forward-looking statements. 
 Cautionary Statement for the Purposes of the Safe Harbor under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 
 The statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. All statements other than statements of historical fact included in this Report are forward-looking statements made in good faith by us and are intended to qualify for the safe harbor from liability established by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

Further, we undertake no obligation to update or revise any of our forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. 
 
 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
 Our consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from estimates. 
 Our significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements. The accounting policies discussed below are both important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and require management to make difficult, subjective or complex accounting estimates. Accordingly, these critical accounting policies are reviewed periodically by the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policy Summary of Policy Factors Influencing Application of the Policy Regulation Our distribution and pipeline operations meet the criteria of a cost-based, rate-regulated entity under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Accordingly, the financial results for these operations reflect the effects of the ratemaking and accounting practices and policies of the various regulatory commissions to which we are subject. As a result, certain costs that would normally be expensed under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States are permitted to be capitalized or deferred on the balance sheet because it is probable they can be recovered through rates. Further, regulation may impact the period in which revenues or expenses are recognized. The amounts expected to be recovered or recognized are based upon historical experience and our understanding of the regulations. Discontinuing the application of this method of accounting for regulatory assets and liabilities or changes in the accounting for our various regulatory mechanisms could significantly increase our operating expenses as fewer costs would likely be capitalized or deferred on the balance sheet, which could reduce our net income.

 Critical Accounting Policy Summary of Policy Factors Influencing Application of the Policy Unbilled Revenue We follow the revenue accrual method of accounting for distribution segment revenues whereby revenues attributable to gas delivered to customers, but not yet billed under the cycle billing method, are estimated and accrued and the related costs are charged to expense. When permitted, we implement rates that have not been formally approved by our regulatory authorities, subject to refund.We recognize this revenue and establish a reserve for amounts that could be refunded based on our experience for the jurisdiction in which the rates were implemented.

 Critical Accounting Policy Summary of Policy Factors Influencing Application of the Policy Pension and other postretirement plans Pension and other postretirement plan costs and liabilities are determined on an actuarial basis using a September 30 measurement date and are affected by numerous assumptions and estimates including the market value of plan assets, estimates of the expected return on plan assets, assumed discount rates and current demographic and actuarial mortality data. The assumed discount rate and the expected return are the assumptions that generally have the most significant impact on our pension costs and liabilities. The assumed discount rate, the assumed health care cost trend rate and assumed rates of retirement generally have the most significant impact on our postretirement plan costs and liabilities. The discount rate is utilized principally in calculating the actuarial present value of our pension and postretirement obligations and net periodic pension and postretirement benefit plan costs. When establishing our discount rate, we consider high quality corporate bond rates based on bonds available in the marketplace that are suitable for settling the obligations, changes in those rates from the prior year and the implied discount rate that is derived from matching our projected benefit disbursements with currently available high quality corporate bonds. The expected long-term rate of return on assets is utilized in calculating the expected return on plan assets component of our annual pension and postretirement plan costs. We estimate the expected return on plan assets by evaluating expected bond returns, equity risk premiums, asset allocations, the effects of active plan management, the impact of periodic plan asset rebalancing and historical performance. We also consider the guidance from our investment advisors in making a final determination of our expected rate of return on assets. To the extent the actual rate of return on assets realized over the course of a year is greater than or less than the assumed rate, that year s annual pension or postretirement plan costs are not affected. Rather, this gain or loss reduces or increases future pension or postretirement plan costs over a period of approximately ten to twelve years. The market-related value of our plan assets represents the fair market value of the plan assets, adjusted to smooth out short-term market fluctuations over a five-year period. The use of this methodology will delay the impact of current market fluctuations on the pension expense for the period. We estimate the assumed health care cost trend rate used in determining our postretirement net expense based upon our actual health care cost experience, the effects of recently enacted legislation and general economic conditions. Our assumed rate of retirement is estimated based upon our annual review of our participant census information as of the measurement date. General economic and market conditions

The evaluation of our goodwill balances and other long-lived assets or identifiable assets for which uncertainty exists regarding the recoverability of the carrying value of such assets involves the assessment of future cash flows and external market conditions and other subjective factors that could impact the estimation of future cash flows including, but not limited to the commodity prices, the amount and timing of future cash flows, future growth rates and the discount rate. Unforeseen events and changes in circumstances or market conditions could adversely affect these estimates, which could result in an impairment charge.

 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 As described further in Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements, due to the passage of Kansas House Bill 2585, we remeasured our deferred tax liability and updated our state deferred tax rate. As a result, we recorded a non-cash income tax benefit of 21.0 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020. Due to the non-recurring nature of this benefit, we believe that net income and diluted net income per share before the non-cash income tax benefit provide a more relevant measure to analyze our financial performance than net income and diluted net income per share in order to allow investors to better analyze our core results and allow the information to be presented on a comparative basis. Accordingly, the following discussion and analysis of our financial performance will reference adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share, non-GAAP measures, which are calculated as follows: 
 For the Fiscal Year Ended September 30 2021 2020 2019 2021 vs. 2020 2020 vs. 2019 (In thousands, except per share data) Net income 665,563 601,443 511,406 64,120 90,037 Non-cash income tax benefits (20,962) 20,962 (20,962) Adjusted net income 665,563 580,481 511,406 85,082 69,075 Diluted net income per share 5.12 4.89 4.35 0.23 0.54 Diluted EPS from non-cash income tax benefits (0.17) 0.17 (0.17) Adjusted diluted net income per share 5.12 4.72 4.35 0.40 0.37 

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 Overview 
 Atmos Energy strives to operate its businesses safely and reliably while delivering superior shareholder value. Our commitment to modernizing our natural gas distribution and transmission systems requires a significant level of capital spending. We have the ability to begin recovering a significant portion of these investments timely through rate designs and mechanisms that reduce or eliminate regulatory lag and separate the recovery of our approved rate from customer usage patterns. The execution of our capital spending program, the ability to recover these investments timely and our ability to access the capital markets to satisfy our financing needs are the primary drivers that affect our financial performance. 
 The following table details our consolidated net income by segment during the last three fiscal years: 
 For the Fiscal Year Ended September 30 2021 2020 2019 (In thousands) Distribution segment 445,862 395,664 328,814 Pipeline and storage segment 219,701 205,779 182,592 Net income 665,563 601,443 511,406 
 During fiscal 2021, we recorded net income of 665.6 million, or 5.12 per diluted share, compared to net income of 601.4 million, or 4.89 per diluted share in the prior year. After adjusting for a nonrecurring income tax benefit recognized during fiscal 2020, adjusted net income was 580.5 million, or 4.72 per diluted share in the prior year. The year-over-year increase in adjusted net income of 85.1 million largely reflects positive rate outcomes driven by safety and reliability spending and distribution customer growth, partially offset by lower service order revenues and higher bad debt expense in our distribution segment due to the temporary suspension of collection activities during the pandemic and increased spending on system maintenance activities. 
 During the year ended September 30, 2021, we implemented ratemaking regulatory actions which resulted in an increase in annual operating income of 185.7 million. Excluding the impact of the refund of excess deferred income taxes resulting from previously enacted tax reform legislation, our total fiscal 2021 rate outcomes were 226.2 million. Additionally, we had ratemaking efforts in progress at September 30, 2021, seeking a total increase in annual operating income of 56.5 million. As of the date of this report, we have received approval to implement 25.0 million of this amount in the first quarter of fiscal 2022. Excluding the impact of the refund of excess deferred income taxes resulting from previously enacted tax reform legislation, we have received approval to implement 68.5 million during the first quarter of fiscal 2022. 
 25 

Table of Contents 

 During fiscal year 2021, we refunded 55.9 million in excess deferred tax liabilities to customers. The refunds reduced operating income and reduced our annual effective income tax rate to 18.8 in fiscal 2021 compared with 19.5 in fiscal 2020. 
 Capital expenditures for fiscal 2021 increased 2 percent period-over-period, to 2.0 billion. Over 85 percent was invested to improve the safety and reliability of our distribution and transportation systems, with a significant portion of this investment incurred under regulatory mechanisms that reduce regulatory lag to six months or less. 
 During fiscal 2021, we completed over 3.4 billion of long-term debt and equity financing, including 2.2 billion of incremental financing issued to pay for the purchased gas costs incurred during Winter Storm Uri. As of September 30, 2021, our equity capitalization was 51.9 percent. Excluding the 2.2 billion of incremental financing, our equity capitalization was 60.6 percent. As of September 30, 2021, we had approximately 2.9 billion in total liquidity, including cash and cash equivalents and funds available through equity forward sales agreements. 
 As a result of the continued stability of our earnings, cash flows and capital structure, our Board of Directors increased the quarterly dividend by 8.8 percent for fiscal 2022. 
 Distribution Segment 
 The distribution segment is primarily comprised of our regulated natural gas distribution and related sales operations in eight states. The primary factors that impact the results of our distribution operations are our ability to earn our authorized rates of return, competitive factors in the energy industry and economic conditions in our service areas. 
 Our ability to earn our authorized rates is based primarily on our ability to improve the rate design in our various ratemaking jurisdictions to minimize regulatory lag and, ultimately, separate the recovery of our approved rates from customer usage patterns. Improving rate design is a long-term process and is further complicated by the fact that we operate in multiple rate jurisdictions. The Ratemaking Activity section of this Form 10-K describes our current rate strategy, progress towards implementing that strategy and recent ratemaking initiatives in more detail. During fiscal 2021, we completed regulatory proceedings in our distribution segment resulting in a 141.8 million increase in annual operating income. Excluding the impact of the refund of excess deferred income taxes resulting from previously enacted tax reform legislation, our total fiscal 2021 annualized rate outcomes in our distribution segment were 182.3 million. 
 Our distribution operations are also affected by the cost of natural gas. We are generally able to pass the cost of gas through to our customers without markup under purchased gas cost adjustment mechanisms; therefore, increases in the cost of gas are offset by a corresponding increase in revenues. Revenues in our Texas and Mississippi service areas include franchise fees and gross receipts taxes, which are calculated as a percentage of revenue (inclusive of gas costs). Therefore, the amount of these taxes included in revenues is influenced by the cost of gas and the level of gas sales volumes. We record the associated tax expense as a component of taxes, other than income. 
 The cost of gas typically does not have a direct impact on our operating income because these costs are recovered through our purchased gas cost adjustment mechanisms. However, higher gas costs may adversely impact our accounts receivable collections, resulting in higher bad debt expense. This risk is currently mitigated by rate design that allows us to collect from our customers the gas cost portion of our bad debt expense on approximately 79 percent of our residential and commercial revenues. Additionally, higher gas costs may require us to increase borrowings under our credit facilities, resulting in higher interest expense. Finally, higher gas costs, as well as competitive factors in the industry and general economic conditions may cause customers to conserve or, in the case of industrial consumers, to use alternative energy sources.

 Fiscal year ended September 30, 2021 compared with fiscal year ended September 30, 2020 
 Operating income for our distribution segment increased 17 percent, which primarily reflects: 
 a 150.6 million increase in rate adjustments, primarily in our Mid-Tex, Mississippi, Louisiana and West Texas Divisions. 
 a 19.2 million increase from customer growth primarily in our Mid-Tex Division. 
 a 3.8 million decrease in employee related costs. 
 a 5.0 million decrease in travel and entertainment expense. 
 Partially offset by: 
 a 43.6 million increase in depreciation expense and property taxes associated with increased capital investments. 
 an 18.2 million increase in bad debt expense primarily due to the temporary suspension of collection activities. 
 a 12.8 million increase in pipeline maintenance and related activities. 
 a 5.1 million increase in insurance expense. 
 an 8.4 million decrease in service order revenues primarily due to the temporary suspension of collection activities. 
 The year-over- year change in other non-operating expense and interest charges of 22.4 million primarily reflects increased amortization of prior service cost associated with our Retiree Medical Plan, as presented in Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements. 
 During fiscal 2021, we refunded 29.4 million in excess deferred taxes in the distribution segment, which reduced operating income year over year and reduced the annual effective income tax rate for this segment to 20.6 compared with 21.6 in the prior year. 
 The fiscal year ended September 30, 2020 compared with fiscal year ended September 30, 2019 for our distribution segment is described in Item 7 "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020.

 Pipeline and Storage Segment 
 Our pipeline and storage segment consists of the pipeline and storage operations of our Atmos Pipeline Texas Division (APT) and our natural gas transmission operations in Louisiana. APT is one of the largest intrastate pipeline operations in Texas with a heavy concentration in the established natural gas producing areas of central, northern and eastern Texas, extending into or near the major producing areas of the Barnett Shale, the Texas Gulf Coast and the Permian Basin of West Texas. APT provides transportation and storage services to our Mid-Tex Division, other third-party local distribution companies, industrial and electric generation customers, as well as marketers and producers. Over 80 percent of this segment's revenues are derived from these services. As part of its pipeline operations, APT owns and operates five underground storage facilities in Texas. 
 Our natural gas transmission operations in Louisiana are comprised of a 21-mile pipeline located in the New Orleans, Louisiana area that is primarily used to aggregate gas supply for our distribution division in Louisiana under a long-term contract and, on a more limited basis, to third parties. The demand fee charged to our Louisiana distribution division for these services is subject to regulatory approval by the Louisiana Public Service Commission. We also manage two asset management plans, which have been approved by applicable state regulatory commissions. Generally, these asset management plans require us to share with our distribution customers a significant portion of the cost savings earned from these arrangements. 
 Our pipeline and storage segment is impacted by seasonal weather patterns, competitive factors in the energy industry and economic conditions in our Texas and Louisiana service areas. Natural gas prices do not directly impact the results of this segment as revenues are derived from the transportation and storage of natural gas. However, natural gas prices and demand for natural gas could influence the level of drilling activity in the supply areas that we serve, which may influence the level of throughput we may be able to transport on our pipelines. Further, natural gas price differences between the various hubs that we serve in Texas could influence the volumes of gas transported for shippers through our Texas pipeline system and rates for such transportation. 
 The results of APT are also significantly impacted by the natural gas requirements of its local distribution company customers. Additionally, its operations may be impacted by the timing of when costs and expenses are incurred and when these costs and expenses are recovered through its tariffs. 
 APT annually uses GRIP to recover capital costs incurred in the prior calendar year. On February 12, 2021, APT made a GRIP filing that covered changes in net property, plant and equipment investment from January 1, 2020 through December 31, 2020 with a requested increase in operating income of 44.0 million. On May 11, 2021, the Texas Railroad Commission approved an increase in operating income of 43.9 million. In February 2021, the RRC approved a reduction in revenue of 106.6 million to refund excess deferred tax liabilities to customers over 35 months. 
 On December 21, 2016, the Louisiana Public Service Commission approved an annual increase of five percent to the demand fee charged by our natural gas transmission pipeline for each of the next 10 years, effective October 1, 2017.

 Fiscal year ended September 30, 2021 compared with fiscal year ended September 30, 2020 
 Operating income for our pipeline and storage segment decreased three percent, which primarily reflects: 
 an 8.2 million net decrease in APT's thru-system activities primarily associated with the tightening of regional spreads driven by increased competing takeaway capacity in the Permian Basin. 
 a 17.1 million increase in system maintenance expense primarily due to spending on hydro testing and in-line inspections. 
 a 17.0 million increase in depreciation expense and property taxes associated with increased capital investments. 
 Partially offset by: 
 a 56.2 million increase due to rate adjustments from the GRIP filings approved in May 2020 and 2021. The increase in rates was driven by increased safety and reliability spending. 
 The year-over- year change in other non-operating income and interest charges of 8.0 million reflects increased allowance for funds used during construction (AFUDC) primarily due to increased capital spending, partially offset by an increase in interest expense due to the issuance of long-term debt during fiscal 2021. 
 During fiscal 2021 we refunded 26.5 million in excess deferred taxes in our pipeline and storage segment, which reduced operating income year over year and reduced the annual effective tax rate for this segment to 14.9 compared with 23.6 in the prior year. 
 The fiscal year ended September 30, 2020 compared with fiscal year ended September 30, 2019 for our pipeline and storage segment is described in Item 7 "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020. 

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 The liquidity required to fund our working capital, capital expenditures and other cash needs is provided from a combination of internally generated cash flows and external debt and equity financing. Additionally, we have a 1.5 billion commercial paper program and four committed revolving credit facilities with 2.5 billion in total availability from third-party 
 29 

Table of Contents 

 lenders. The commercial paper program and credit facilities provide cost-effective, short-term financing until it can be replaced with a balance of long-term debt and equity financing that achieves the Company's desired capital structure with an equity-to-total-capitalization ratio between 50 and 60 , inclusive of long-term and short-term debt. Additionally, we have various uncommitted trade credit lines with our gas suppliers that we utilize to purchase natural gas on a monthly basis. 
 We have a shelf registration statement on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that allows us to issue up to 5.0 billion in common stock and/or debt securities. As of the date of this report, approximately 3.4 billion of securities remained available for issuance under the shelf registration statement, which expires June 29, 2024. 
 We also have an at-the-market (ATM) equity sales program that allows us to issue and sell shares of our common stock up to an aggregate offering price of 1.0 billion (including shares of common stock that may be sold pursuant to forward sale agreements entered into in connection with the ATM equity sales program), which expires June 29, 2024. At September 30, 2021, approximately 760 million of equity is available for issuance under this ATM equity sales program. Additionally, as of September 30, 2021, we had 302.0 million in available proceeds from outstanding forward sale agreements that must be settled during fiscal 2022. 
 During fiscal 2021, we entered into forward starting interest rate swaps to effectively fix the Treasury yield component associated with 1.4 billion of planned issuances of unsecured senior notes. During fiscal 2021, we settled swaps of 600 million with a net receipt of 62.2 million. On October 1, 2021, the notes were issued as planned. 
 The following table summarizes our existing forward starting interest rate swaps as of September 30, 2021. 
 Planned Debt Issuance Date Amount Hedged Effective Interest Rate (In thousands) Fiscal 2023 500,000 1.66 Fiscal 2024 450,000 1.80 Fiscal 2025 600,000 1.75 Fiscal 2026 300,000 2.16 1,850,000 
 The liquidity provided by these sources is expected to be sufficient to fund the Company's working capital needs and capital expenditures program. Additionally, we expect to continue to be able to obtain financing upon reasonable terms as necessary. 
 The following table presents our capitalization as of September 30, 2021 and 2020: 
 September 30 2021 2020 (In thousands, except percentages) Short-term debt Long-term debt (1)

 (1) Inclusive of our finance leases. 
 (2) Excluding the 2.2 billion of incremental financing issued to pay for the purchased gas costs incurred during Winter Storm Uri, our equity capitalization ratio would have been 60.6 . 

Cash Flows 
 Our internally generated funds may change in the future due to a number of factors, some of which we cannot control. These factors include regulatory changes, the price for our services, the demand for such products and services, margin requirements resulting from significant changes in commodity prices, operational risks and other factors. 
 Cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities for the years ended September 30, 2021, 2020 and 2019 are presented below.

 Cash flows for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020 compared with fiscal year ended September 30, 2019 is described in Item 7 "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020. 
 Cash flows from operating activities 
 For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021, cash flow used from operating activities was 1.1 billion compared with cash flows generated from operating activities of 1.0 billion in the prior year. The year-over-year decrease in operating cash flows reflects gas costs incurred during Winter Storm Uri and the timing of customer collections partially offset by the positive effects of successful rate case outcomes achieved in fiscal 2020 and 2021. 
 Cash flows from investing activities 
 Our capital expenditures are primarily used to improve the safety and reliability of our distribution and transmission system through pipeline replacement and system modernization and to enhance and expand our system to meet customer needs. Over the last three fiscal years, approximately 88 percent of our capital spending has been committed to improving the safety and reliability of our system. 
 For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021, we had 1.97 billion in capital expenditures compared with 1.94 billion for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020. Capital spending increased by 33.8 million, or two percent, as a result of planned increases to modernize our system. 
 Cash flows from financing activities 
 Our financing activities provided 3.1 billion and 883.8 million in cash for fiscal years 2021 and 2020. 
 During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021, we received 3.4 billion in net proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt and equity. We completed a public offering of 600 million of 1.50 senior notes due 2031, 1.1 billion of 0.625 senior notes due 2023 and 1.1 billion floating rate senior notes due 2023. Net proceeds from the latter two notes were used to pay for gas costs incurred during Winter Storm Uri. Additionally, during the year ended September 30, 2021, we settled 6,130,875 shares that had been sold on a forward basis for net proceeds of 606.7 million. The net proceeds were used primarily to support capital spending and for other general corporate purposes, including the payment of natural gas purchases. Additionally, cash dividends increased due to an 8.7 percent increase in our dividend rate and an increase in shares outstanding. 
 During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020, we received 1.6 billion in net proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt and equity. We completed a public offering of 300 million of 2.625 senior notes due 2029 and 500 million of 3.375 senior notes due 2049 and entered into a two year 200 million term loan. We received net proceeds from these offerings, after the underwriting discount and offering expenses, of 791.7 million. Additionally, we settled 6,101,916 shares that had been sold on a forward basis for net proceeds of approximately 624 million. The net proceeds were used primarily to support capital spending, reduce short-term debt and other general corporate purposes. Cash dividends increased due to a 9.5 percent increase in our dividend rate and an increase in shares outstanding.

 (1) Share amounts do not include shares issued under forward sale agreements until the shares have been settled. 
 
 Credit Ratings 
 Our credit ratings directly affect our ability to obtain short-term and long-term financing, in addition to the cost of such financing. In determining our credit ratings, the rating agencies consider a number of quantitative factors, including but not limited to, debt to total capitalization, operating cash flow relative to outstanding debt, operating cash flow coverage of interest and operating cash flow less dividends to debt. In addition, the rating agencies consider qualitative factors such as consistency of our earnings over time, the risks associated with our business and the regulatory structures that govern our rates in the states where we operate. 
 Our debt is rated by two rating agencies: Standard Poor s Corporation (S P) and Moody s Investors Service (Moody s). As a result of the impacts of Winter Storm Uri, during the second quarter of fiscal 2021, S P lowered our long-term and short-term credit ratings by one notch and placed our ratings under negative outlook and Moody's reaffirmed its long-term and short-term credit ratings and placed our ratings under negative outlook. 
 As of September 30, 2021, our outlook and current debt ratings, which are all considered investment grade are as follows: 
 S P Moody s Senior unsecured long-term debt A- A1 Short-term debt A-2 P-1 Outlook Negative Negative 
 A significant degradation in our operating performance or a significant reduction in our liquidity caused by more limited access to the private and public credit markets as a result of deteriorating global or national financial and credit conditions could trigger a negative change in our ratings outlook or even a reduction in our credit ratings by the two credit rating agencies. This would mean more limited access to the private and public credit markets and an increase in the costs of such borrowings. 
 A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities. The highest investment grade credit rating is AAA for S P and Aaa for Moody s. The lowest investment grade credit rating is BBB- for S P and Baa3 for Moody s. Our credit ratings may be revised or withdrawn at any time by the rating agencies, and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. There can be no assurance that a rating will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered, or withdrawn entirely, by a rating agency if, in its judgment, circumstances so warrant. 
 
 Debt Covenants 
 We were in compliance with all of our debt covenants as of September 30, 2021. Our debt covenants are described in Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements.

 (1) Long-term debt excludes our finance lease obligations, which are separately reported within this table. The 1.1 billion of 0.625 senior notes and 1.1 billion floating rate senior notes that were issued in March 2021 contractually mature in 2023; however, we intend to repay these after the receipt of securitization funds, which we expect will occur in the next twelve months. As such, we have classified the senior notes as current maturities of long-term debt as of September 30, 2021. See Notes 7 and 9 to the consolidated financial statements for further details.

 (7) Represents liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions claimed or expected to be claimed on tax returns. The amount does not include interest and penalties that may be applied to these positions. 
 
 We maintain supply contracts with several vendors that generally cover a period of up to one year. Commitments for estimated base gas volumes are established under these contracts on a monthly basis at contractually negotiated prices. Commitments for incremental daily purchases are made as necessary during the month in accordance with the terms of individual contracts. Our Mid-Tex Division also maintains a limited number of long-term supply contracts to ensure a reliable source of gas for our customers in its service area which obligate it to purchase specified volumes at market and fixed prices. At September 30, 2021, we were committed to purchase 32.4 Bcf within one year and 12.9 Bcf within two to three years under indexed contracts. At September 30, 2021, we were committed to purchase 11.9 Bcf within one year under fixed price contracts ranging from 1.86 to 7.03 per Mcf. 
 
 Risk Management Activities 
 In our distribution and pipeline and storage segments, we use a combination of physical storage, fixed physical contracts and fixed financial contracts to reduce our exposure to unusually large winter-period gas price increases. Additionally, we manage interest rate risk by entering into financial instruments to effectively fix the Treasury yield component of the interest cost associated with anticipated financings. 
 We record our financial instruments as a component of risk management assets and liabilities, which are classified as current or noncurrent based upon the anticipated settlement date of the underlying financial instrument. Substantially all of our financial instruments are valued using external market quotes and indices.

RECENT ACCOUNTING DEVELOPMENTS 
 Recent accounting developments and their impact on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows are described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements. 
 
 ITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 We are exposed to risks associated with commodity prices and interest rates. Commodity price risk is the potential loss that we may incur as a result of changes in the fair value of a particular instrument or commodity. Interest-rate risk is the potential increased cost we could incur when we issue debt instruments or to provide financing and liquidity for our business activities. Additionally, interest-rate risk could affect our ability to issue cost effective equity instruments. 
 We conduct risk management activities in our distribution and pipeline and storage segments. In our distribution segment, we use a combination of physical storage, fixed-price forward contracts and financial instruments, primarily over-the-counter swap and option contracts, in an effort to minimize the impact of natural gas price volatility on our customers during the winter heating season. Our risk management activities and related accounting treatment are described in further detail in Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements. Additionally, our earnings are affected by changes in short-term interest rates as a result of our issuance of short-term commercial paper and our other short-term borrowings. 
 Commodity Price Risk 
 We purchase natural gas for our distribution operations. Substantially all of the costs of gas purchased for distribution operations are recovered from our customers through purchased gas cost adjustment mechanisms. Therefore, our distribution operations have limited commodity price risk exposure. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 Our earnings are exposed to changes in short-term interest rates associated with our short-term commercial paper program and other short-term borrowings. We use a sensitivity analysis to estimate our short-term interest rate risk. For purposes of this analysis, we estimate our short-term interest rate risk as the difference between our actual interest expense for the period and estimated interest expense for the period assuming a hypothetical average one percent increase in the interest rates associated with our short-term borrowings. Had interest rates associated with our short-term borrowings increased by an average of one percent, our interest expense would not have materially increased during 2021.

 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
 
 To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Atmos Energy Corporation 
 Opinion on the Financial Statements 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Atmos Energy Corporation (the Company as of September 30, 2021 and 2020, the related consolidated statements of comprehensive income, shareholders equity, and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2021, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the "consolidated financial statements"). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at September 30, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2021, in conformity with US generally accepted accounting principles. 
 We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated November 12, 2021 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. 
 
 Basis for Opinion 
 These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the US federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 Critical Audit Matter 
 The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. 
 Determination of Capital Costs 
 Description of the Matter As more fully described in Note 2 to the financial statements, the Company capitalizes the direct and indirect costs of construction. Once a project is completed, it is placed into service and included in the Company s rate base. Costs of maintenance and repairs that are not included in the Company s rate base are charged to expense. For the year ended September 30, 2021, the Company capitalized approximately 2.0 billion of construction-related costs for regulated property, plant and equipment. 
 Auditing management s identification of capital additions and maintenance and repairs expense involved significant effort and auditor judgment. These amounts have both a higher magnitude and a higher likelihood of potential misstatement. As a cost-based, rate-regulated entity, the rates charged to customers are designed to recover the entity s costs and provide a rate of return on rate base. Net property, plant and equipment is the most significant component of the Company s rate base. As a result, inappropriate capitalization of costs could affect the amount, timing and classification of revenues and expenses in the financial statements.

Table of Contents 

 How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of the Company s controls over the initial determination and approval of expenditures for either capital additions or maintenance and repair. For example, we selected a sample of projects initiated during the year to evaluate the effectiveness of management s review controls to determine the proper categorization of project expenditures as either capitalizable costs or current-period expense. 
 Our audit procedures included, among others, testing a sample of projects initiated during the year, including the evaluation of the nature of the project, with Company personnel outside of accounting and financial reporting. For example, we evaluated project setup through inspection of each project s description for compliance with the Company s capitalization policy as described in Note 2 and a series of inquiries of the project approver to understand how they assessed whether projects should be treated as capital or expense. Other audit procedures included evaluating whether the descriptions and amounts included on third-party invoices either support or contradict the project classification as capital, evaluating the appropriateness of individuals capitalizing direct labor charges to projects by assessing the relevance of their job function to the capital project, and recalculating other overhead costs capitalized to projects.

of the difference between the total non-tariffed revenues earned during a test period and a revenue benchmark of million that was established in its most recent rate case. Differences between actual revenues and revenues calculated under these mechanisms adjust the amount billed to customers. These mechanisms are considered to be alternative revenue programs under accounting standards generally accepted in the United States as they are deemed to be contracts between us and our regulator. Accordingly, revenue under these mechanisms are excluded from revenue from contracts with customers.

Equity Other non-operating income (expense) 
 Major renewals, including replacement pipe, and betterments that are recoverable through our regulatory rate base are capitalized while the costs of maintenance and repairs that are not capitalizable are charged to expense as incurred. The costs of large projects are accumulated in construction in progress until the project is completed. When the project is completed, tested and placed in service, the balance is transferred to the regulated plant in service account included in the rate base and depreciation begins. 
 Regulated property, plant and equipment is depreciated at various rates on a straight-line basis. These rates are approved by our regulatory commissions and are comprised of two components: one based on average service life and one based on cost of removal. Accordingly, we recognize our cost of removal expense as a component of depreciation expense. The related cost of removal accrual is reflected as a regulatory liability on the consolidated balance sheet. At the time property, plant and equipment is retired, removal expenses less salvage, are charged to the regulatory cost of removal accrual. The composite depreciation rate was percent, percent and percent for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2021, 2020 and 2019. 
 Other property, plant and equipment is stated at cost. Depreciation is generally computed on the straight-line method for financial reporting purposes based upon estimated useful lives. 
 million and million. Additionally, we had million and million of asset retirement costs recorded as a component of property, plant and equipment that will be depreciated over the remaining life of the underlying associated assets. 
 We believe we have a legal obligation to retire our natural gas storage facilities. However, we have not recognized an asset retirement obligation associated with our storage facilities because we are not able to determine the settlement date of this obligation as we do not anticipate taking our storage facilities out of service permanently. Therefore, we cannot reasonably estimate the fair value of this obligation.

 reportable segments: 
 states. 
 The pipeline and storage segment is comprised primarily of the pipeline and storage operations of our Atmos Pipeline-Texas division and our natural gas transmission operations in Louisiana. 
 Our determination of reportable segments considers the strategic operating units under which we manage sales of various products and services to customers. Although our distribution segment operations are geographically dispersed, they are aggregated and reported as a single segment as each natural gas distribution division has similar economic characteristics. In addition, because the pipeline and storage operations of our Atmos Pipeline-Texas division and our natural gas transmission operations in Louisiana have similar economic characteristics, they have been aggregated and reported as a single segment. 
 The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies. We evaluate performance based on net income or loss of the respective operating units. We allocate interest and pension expense to the pipeline and storage segment; however, there is no debt or pension liability recorded on the pipeline and storage segment balance sheet. All material intercompany transactions have been eliminated; however, we have not eliminated intercompany profits when such amounts are probable of recovery under the affiliates rate regulation process. Income taxes are allocated to each segment as if each segment s income taxes were calculated on a separate return basis.

million of senior notes due 2031, with an effective interest rate of , after giving effect to the offering costs and settlement of our interest rate swaps. The net proceeds from the offering, after the underwriting discount and offering expenses, of million, were used for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of working capital borrowings pursuant to our commercial paper program and the related settlement of our interest rate swaps. 
 Short-term Debt 
 We utilize short-term debt to provide cost-effective, short-term financing until it can be replaced with a balance of long-term debt and equity financing that achieves the Company s desired capital structure with an equity-to-total-capitalization ratio between and , inclusive of long-term and short-term debt. Our short-term borrowing requirements are driven primarily by construction work in progress and the seasonal nature of the natural gas business. 
 Our short-term borrowing requirements are satisfied through a combination of a billion commercial paper program and committed revolving credit facilities with third-party lenders that provide billion of total working capital funding. 
 The primary source of our funding is our commercial paper program, which is supported by a unsecured billion credit facility that was replaced on March 31, 2021, with a new unsecured billion credit facility that expires on March 31, 2026. The new facility bears interest at a base rate or at a LIBOR-based rate for the applicable interest period, plus a margin ranging from to percent for base rate advances or a margin ranging from percent to percent for LIBOR-based advances, based on the Company s credit ratings. Additionally, the facility contains a million accordion feature, which provides the opportunity to increase the total committed loan to billion. At September 30, 2021 and September 30, 2020, there were amounts outstanding under our commercial paper program. 
 We had a million -day unsecured revolving credit facility, which was replaced on March 31, 2021, with a new million unsecured revolving credit facility. This new facility will be used primarily to provide additional working capital funding. The new facility bears interest at a base rate or at a LIBOR-based rate for the applicable interest period, plus a margin ranging from percent to percent for base rate advances or a margin ranging from percent to percent for LIBOR-based advances, based on the Company's credit ratings. Additionally, the facility contains a million accordion feature, which provides the opportunity to increase the total committed loan to billion. At September 30, 2021, there were borrowings outstanding under this facility. 
 Additionally, we have a million -day unsecured facility, which was renewed April 1, 2021 and is used to provide working capital funding. There were borrowings outstanding under this facility as of September 30, 2021. 
 Finally, we have a million -day unsecured revolving credit facility, which was renewed April 29, 2021 and is used to issue letters of credit and to provide working capital funding. At September 30, 2021, there were borrowings outstanding under the new facility; however, outstanding letters of credit reduced the total amount available to us to million. 
 Debt Covenants 
 The availability of funds under these credit facilities is subject to conditions specified in the respective credit agreements, all of which we currently satisfy. These conditions include our compliance with financial covenants and the continued accuracy of representations and warranties contained in these agreements. We are required by the financial covenants in each of these facilities to maintain, at the end of each fiscal quarter, a ratio of total-debt-to-total-capitalization of no greater than percent. At September 30, 2021, our total-debt-to-total-capitalization ratio, as defined, was percent. In addition, both the interest margin and the fee that we pay on unused amounts under each of these facilities are subject to adjustment depending upon our credit ratings. 
 These credit facilities and our public indentures contain usual and customary covenants for our business, including covenants substantially limiting liens, substantial asset sales and mergers. Additionally, our public debt indentures relating to our senior notes and debentures, as well as certain of our revolving credit agreements, each contain a default provision that is triggered if outstanding indebtedness arising out of any other credit agreements in amounts ranging from in excess of million to in excess of million becomes due by acceleration or is not paid at maturity. We were in compliance with all of our debt covenants as of September 30, 2021. If we were unable to comply with our debt covenants, we would likely be required to repay our outstanding balances on demand, provide additional collateral or take other corrective actions.

 billion. These gas costs were paid by the end of March 2021. 
 Incremental Financing 
 As discussed in Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements, on March 9, 2021, we completed a public offering of billion in debt securities and the net proceeds from the offering, after the underwriting discount and offering expenses, were used to substantially fund these purchased gas costs. As a result of this unplanned debt issuance, S P lowered its long-term/short-term credit ratings from A/A-1 to A-/A-2 and placed our ratings under negative outlook. Moody s reaffirmed its long-term and short-term credit ratings and placed our ratings under negative outlook. These credit rating adjustments and the issuance of unplanned debt did not impact our ability to satisfy our debt covenants. 
 Regulatory Asset Accounting 
 Our purchased gas costs are recoverable through purchased gas cost adjustment mechanisms in each state where we operate. Due to the unprecedented level of purchased gas costs incurred during Winter Storm Uri, the Kansas Corporation Commission (KCC) and the Railroad Commission of Texas (RRC) issued orders authorizing natural gas utilities to record a regulatory asset to account for the extraordinary costs associated with the winter storm. Pursuant to these orders, as of September 30, 2021, we have recorded a billion regulatory asset for incremental costs, including carrying costs, incurred in Kansas million) and Texas million). These costs are subject to review for prudency by each commission and may be adjusted. 
 Securitization 
 To minimize the impact on the customer bill by extending the recovery periods for these unprecedented purchased gas costs, the Kansas and Texas State Legislatures each approved securitization legislation during fiscal 2021. The following summarizes the status of the securitization of each state as of the date of this filing. 
 Kansas 
 The Kansas securitization legislation, which became effective April 9, 2021, permits a natural gas public utility, in its sole discretion, to apply to the KCC for a financing order for the recovery of qualified extraordinary costs through the issuance of bonds. Within 25 days after a complete application is filed, the KCC shall establish a procedural schedule that requires it to issue a decision on the application within 180 days from the date a complete application was filed. Utilities may apply for a recovery period of up to 32 years. 
 On September 14, 2021, we filed with the KCC an application to securitize million of extraordinary gas costs incurred during Winter Storm Uri. This amount also includes an estimate of penalties, carrying costs and administrative costs

million is capitalized for ratemaking purposes but is not recorded as a regulatory asset on our consolidated balance sheet. We anticipate proceedings to begin in January 2022. Because we intend to securitize these costs and recover over several years, we have recorded the regulatory asset for Kansas as a long-term asset in deferred charges and other assets as of September 30, 2021. 
 Texas 
 On June 16, 2021, House Bill 1520 became effective. House Bill 1520 authorizes the RRC to issue a statewide securitization financing order directing the Texas Public Finance authority to issue bonds (customer rate relief bonds) for gas utilities that choose to participate to recover extraordinary costs incurred to secure gas supply and to provide service during Winter Storm Uri, and to restore gas utility systems after that event, thereby providing rate relief to customers by extending the period during which these extraordinary costs would otherwise be recovered and supporting the financial strength and stability of gas utility companies. 
 The legislation required natural gas utilities seeking to participate in the securitization program to file an application with the RRC and submit extraordinary gas costs incurred during Winter Storm Uri for a prudency review by July 30, 2021. We filed our application with the RRC on July 30, 2021 to securitize billion of extraordinary gas costs incurred during Winter Storm Uri. This amount also included an estimate of carrying costs and administrative costs that we expect to incur in connection with the resolution of this filing. 
 On November 10, 2021, the RRC issued a Final Determination of the Regulatory Asset (the Final Determination). The Final Determination stipulates that all of our gas and storage costs were prudently incurred. Additionally, the Final Determination permits us to defer, through December 31, 2021 our actual carrying costs associated with the billion of incremental financing issued in March 2021 and to recover approximately million of our administrative costs. 
 The statutory deadline for the RRC to issue a Financing Order is March 27, 2022. The Financing Order will be issued to the Texas Public Financing Authority authorizing the issuance of customer rate relief bonds to securitize the aggregated extraordinary costs for all participating utilities within 180 days. The participating utilities, as servicers acting on behalf of the state of the securitization financing, will bill and collect customer rate relief charges from their current and future customers and remit the collections to the state issuer of the securitization financing. 
 Based on the RRC's procedural schedule, we believe we will receive the securitization funds within twelve months. We will repay the billion in public notes issued to finance the incremental gas costs incurred during Winter Storm Uri. Accordingly, we have recorded the regulatory asset for Texas in other current assets and these notes as current maturities of long-term debt as of September 30, 2021.

 Defined Benefit Plans 
 Employee Pension Plan 
 As of September 30, 2021, we maintained one cash balance defined benefit plan, the Atmos Energy Corporation Pension Account Plan (the Plan). The Plan was established effective January 1999 and covers most of the employees of Atmos Energy that were hired on or before September 30, 2010. Effective October 1, 2010, the plan was closed to new participants. The assets of the Plan are held within the Atmos Energy Corporation Master Retirement Trust (the Master Trust). 
 Opening account balances were established for participants as of January 1999 equal to the present value of their respective accrued benefits under the pension plans which were previously in effect as of December 31, 1998. The Plan credits an allocation to each participant s account at the end of each year according to a formula based on the participant s age, service and total pay (excluding incentive pay). In addition, at the end of each year, a participant s account is credited with interest on the employee s prior year account balance. Participants are fully vested in their account balances after of service and may choose to receive their account balances as a lump sum or an annuity. 
 Generally, our funding policy is to contribute annually an amount in accordance with the requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, including the funding requirements under the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (PPA). However, additional voluntary contributions are made from time to time as considered necessary. Contributions are intended to provide not only for benefits attributed to service to date but also for those expected to be earned in the future. 
 During fiscal 2021, we contributed million in cash to the Plan to achieve a desired level of funding while maximizing the tax deductibility of this payment. During fiscal 2020, we did t make a contribution to the Plan. Based upon market conditions at September 30, 2021, the current funded position of the Plan and the funding requirements under the PPA, we do not anticipate a minimum required contribution for fiscal 2022. However, we may consider whether a voluntary contribution is prudent to maintain certain funding levels. 
 We make investment decisions and evaluate performance of the assets in the Master Trust on a medium-term horizon of at least three to . We also consider our current financial status when making recommendations and decisions regarding the Master Trust s assets. Finally, we strive to ensure the Master Trust s assets are appropriately invested to maintain an acceptable level of risk and meet the Master Trust s long-term asset investment policy adopted by the Board of Directors. 
 To achieve these objectives, we invest the Master Trust s assets in equity securities, fixed income securities, interests in commingled pension trust funds, other investment assets and cash and cash equivalents. Investments in equity securities are diversified among the market s various subsectors in an effort to diversify risk and maximize returns. Fixed income securities are invested in investment grade securities. Cash equivalents are invested in securities that either are short term (less than 180 days) or readily convertible to cash with modest risk.

percent of covered compensation under which benefits paid from the underlying qualified defined benefit plan are an offset to the benefits under the SEBP. 
 In August 1998, we adopted the Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (SERP) (formerly known as the Performance-Based Supplemental Executive Benefits Plan), which covers all corporate officers selected to participate in the plan between August 12, 1998 and August 5, 2009. The SERP is a defined benefit arrangement which provides a benefit equal to percent of covered compensation under which benefits paid from the underlying qualified defined benefit plan are an offset to the benefits under the SERP. 
 Effective August 5, 2009, we adopted a new defined benefit Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (the 2009 SERP), for corporate officers or any other employees selected at the discretion of the Board. Under the 2009 SERP, a nominal account has been established for each participant, to which the Company contributes at the end of each calendar year an amount equal to percent percent for members of the Management Committee appointed on or after January 1, 2016) of the total of each participant s base salary and cash incentive compensation earned during each prior calendar year, beginning December 31, 2009. The benefits vest after of service and attainment of age and earn interest credits at the same annual rate as the Company s Pension Account Plan. 
 Due to the retirement of certain executives of the company during fiscal 2021, we recognized a settlement charge of million and paid a million lump sum in relation to the retirements. 
 Similar to our employee pension plans, we review the estimates and assumptions underlying our supplemental plans annually based upon a September 30 measurement date using the same techniques as our employee pension plans.

 Postretirement Benefits 
 We sponsor the Retiree Medical Plan for Retirees and Disabled Employees of Atmos Energy Corporation (the Atmos Retiree Medical Plan). This plan provides medical and prescription drug protection to all qualified participants based on their date of retirement. The Atmos Retiree Medical Plan provides different levels of benefits depending on the level of coverage chosen by the participants and the terms of predecessor plans; however, we generally pay percent of the projected net claims and administrative costs and participants pay the remaining percent. Effective January 1, 2015, for employees who had not met the participation requirements by September 30, 2009, the contribution rates for the Company are limited to a percent cost increase in claims and administrative costs each year, with the participant responsible for the additional costs. 
 Generally, our funding policy is to contribute annually an amount in accordance with the requirements of ERISA. However, additional voluntary contributions are made annually as considered necessary. Contributions are intended to provide not only for benefits attributed to service to date but also for those expected to be earned in the future. We expect to contribute between million and million to our postretirement benefits plan during fiscal 2022. 
 We maintain a formal investment policy with respect to the assets in our postretirement benefits plan to ensure the assets funding the postretirement benefit plan are appropriately invested to maintain an acceptable level of risk. We also consider our current financial status when making recommendations and decisions regarding the postretirement benefits plan. 
 We currently invest the assets funding our postretirement benefit plan in diversified investment funds which consist of common stocks, preferred stocks and fixed income securities. The diversified investment funds may invest up to percent of assets in common stocks and convertible securities.

 Regulatory Excess Deferred Taxes 
 Regulatory excess net deferred taxes represent changes in our net deferred tax liability related to our cost of service ratemaking due to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the TCJA) and a Kansas legislative change enacted in fiscal 2020. As of September 30, 2021 and September 30, 2020, million and million is recorded in other current liabilities. This amount has increased during fiscal 2021 due to regulatory approvals received during the fiscal year that shortened the refund period in certain of our jurisdictions.

and percent of anticipated heating season gas purchases using financial instruments. For the 2020-2021 heating season (generally October through March), in the jurisdictions where we are permitted to utilize financial instruments, we hedged approximately percent, or approximately Bcf of the winter flowing gas requirements at a weighted average cost of approximately per Mcf. We have not designated these financial instruments as hedges for accounting purposes. 
 Interest Rate Risk Management Activities 
 We manage interest rate risk by periodically entering into financial instruments to effectively fix the Treasury yield component of the interest cost associated with anticipated financings. 
 In fiscal 2021, we entered into forward starting interest rate swaps to effectively fix the Treasury yield component associated with billion of planned issuances of senior unsecured notes. These swaps were designated as cash flow hedges at the time the agreements were executed. 
 In September 2021, we settled forward starting interest rate swaps with a notional amount of million and received million. On October 1, 2021, the notes were issued as planned. 
 Quantitative Disclosures Related to Financial Instruments 
 The following tables present detailed information concerning the impact of financial instruments on our consolidated balance sheet and statements of comprehensive income. 
 As of September 30, 2021, our financial instruments were comprised of both long and short commodity positions. A long position is a contract to purchase the commodity, while a short position is a contract to sell the commodity. As of September 30, 2021, we had MMcf of net long commodity contracts outstanding. These contracts have not been designated as hedges.

 Cash Flow Hedges 
 As discussed above, our distribution segment has interest rate agreements, which we designate as cash flow hedges at the time the agreements were executed. The net loss on settled interest rate agreements reclassified from AOCI into interest charges on our consolidated statements of comprehensive income for the years ended September 30, 2021, 2020 and 2019 was million, million and million. 
 Recognition of losses in earnings due to settlements: Interest rate agreements Total other comprehensive income from hedging, net of tax 
 Deferred gains (losses) recorded in AOCI associated with our interest rate agreements are recognized in earnings as they are amortized over the terms of the underlying debt instruments. As of September 30, 2021, we had million of net realized losses in AOCI associated with our interest rate agreements.

 Financial Instruments Not Designated as Hedges 
 As discussed above, commodity contracts which are used in our distribution segment are not designated as hedges. However, there is no earnings impact on our distribution segment as a result of the use of these financial instruments because the gains and losses arising from the use of these financial instruments are recognized in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income as a component of purchased gas cost when the related costs are recovered through our rates and recognized in revenue. Accordingly, the impact of these financial instruments is excluded from this presentation.

 Other Fair Value Measures 
 In addition to the financial instruments above, we have several financial and nonfinancial assets and liabilities subject to fair value measures. These financial assets and liabilities include cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, finance leases and debt, which are recorded at carrying value. The nonfinancial assets and liabilities include asset retirement obligations and pension and post-retirement plan assets. For cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and finance leases we consider carrying value to materially approximate fair value due to the short-term nature of these assets and liabilities. 
 Our long-term debt is recorded at carrying value. The fair value of our long-term debt, excluding finance leases, is determined using third party market value quotations, which are considered Level 1 fair value measurements for debt instruments with a recent, observable trade or Level 2 fair value measurements for debt instruments where fair value is determined using the most recent available quoted market price.

 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
 
 To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Atmos Energy Corporation 
 
 Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 We have audited Atmos Energy Corporation s internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Atmos Energy Corporation (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2021, based on the COSO criteria. 
 
 We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the 2021 consolidated financial statements of the Company and our report dated November 12, 2021 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. 
 
 Basis for Opinion 
 The Company s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 
 We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. 
 
 Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 
 Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

 DESCRIPTION OF COMMON STOCK 
 
 The following summary of the common stock, no par value per share (the common stock ), of Atmos Energy Corporation (the Company is based on and qualified by reference to, the Company s Restated Articles of Incorporation filed in Texas and Virginia (the Articles of Incorporation and Amended and Restated Bylaws (the Bylaws ). For a complete description of the terms and provisions of the Company s equity securities, including its common stock, refer to the Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws, each of which are filed as exhibits to this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 
 General 
 
 Our authorized capital stock consists of 200,000,000 shares of common stock, no par value. Each of our shares of common stock is entitled to one vote on all matters voted upon by shareholders. Our shareholders do not have cumulative voting rights. With respect to any matter, other than a matter for which the affirmative vote of the holders of a specified portion of common stock may be required by law or our Articles of Incorporation, an act of the shareholders requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares entitled to vote on a matter and represented in person or by proxy at a meeting at which a quorum is present. The power to alter, amend or repeal the Bylaws, and to adopt new Bylaws, is vested in our Board of Directors, subject to repeal or change by the affirmative vote of the holders of 75 percent of the outstanding shares of common stock entitled to vote thereon. Our issued and outstanding shares of common stock are fully paid and nonassessable. There are no redemption or sinking fund provisions applicable to the shares of our common stock, and such shares are not entitled to any preemptive rights. Since we are incorporated in both Texas and Virginia, we must comply with the laws of both states when issuing shares of our common stock. 
 
 Holders of our shares of common stock are entitled to receive such dividends as may be declared from time to time by our board of directors from our assets legally available for the payment of dividends and, upon our liquidation, a pro rata share of all of our assets available for distribution to our shareholders. 
 
 Broadridge Corporate Issuer Solutions, Inc. is the registrar and transfer agent for our common stock. 
 
 Our common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the trading symbol ATO. 

Charter and Bylaws Provisions 
 
 Some provisions of our Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws may be deemed to have an anti-takeover effect. The following description of these provisions is only a summary, and we refer you to our Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws for more information. 
 
 Cumulative Voting. Our Articles of Incorporation prohibit cumulative voting. In general, in the absence of cumulative voting, one or more persons who hold a majority of our outstanding shares can elect all of the directors who are subject to election at any meeting of shareholders. 
 
 Removal of Directors. Our Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws also provide that our directors may be removed only for cause and upon the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 75 percent of the shares then entitled to vote at an election of directors. 
 
 Fair Price Provisions. Article VII of our Articles of Incorporation provides certain Fair Price Provisions for our shareholders. Under Article VII, a merger, consolidation, sale of assets, share exchange, recapitalization or other similar transaction, between us or a company controlled by or under common control with us and any individual, corporation or other entity which, alone or together with its affiliates or associates, owns or controls 10 percent or more of our voting capital stock, would be required to satisfy the condition that the aggregate consideration per share to be received in the transaction for each class of our voting capital stock be at least equal to the highest per share price, or equivalent price for any different classes or series of stock, paid by the 10 percent shareholder in acquiring any of its holdings of our stock. If a proposed transaction with a 10 percent shareholder does not meet this condition, then the transaction must be approved by the holders of at least 75 percent of the outstanding shares of voting capital stock held by our shareholders other than the 10 percent shareholder, unless a majority of the directors who were members of our board immediately prior to the time the 10 percent shareholder involved in the proposed transaction became a 10 percent shareholder have either 
 
 expressly approved in advance the acquisition of the outstanding shares of our voting capital stock that caused the 10 percent shareholder to become a 10 percent shareholder or 
 
 approved the transaction either in advance of or subsequent to the 10 percent shareholder becoming a 10 percent shareholder. 
 
 The provisions of Article VII may not be amended, altered, changed, or repealed except by the affirmative vote of at least 75 percent of the votes entitled to be cast thereon at a meeting of our shareholders duly called for consideration of such amendment, alteration, change, or repeal. In addition, if there is a 10 percent shareholder, such action must also be approved by the affirmative vote of at least 75 percent of the outstanding shares of our voting capital stock held by the shareholders other than the 10 percent shareholder. 

Shareholder Proposals and Director Nominations. Our shareholders can submit shareholder proposals and nominate candidates for the board of directors if the shareholders follow the advance notice procedures described in our bylaws. 
 
 Shareholder proposals (other than those sought to be included in our proxy statement) must be submitted to our corporate secretary at least 60 days, but not more than 85 days, before the annual meeting provided, however, that if less than 75 days notice or prior public disclosure of the date of the annual meeting is given or made to shareholders, notice by the shareholder to be timely must be received by our corporate secretary no later than the close of business on the 25th day following the day on which such notice of the date of the annual meeting was provided or such public disclosure was made. The notice must include a description of the proposal, the shareholder s name and address and the number of shares held, and all other information which would be required to be included in a proxy statement filed with the SEC if the shareholder were a participant in a solicitation subject to the SEC s proxy rules. To be included in our proxy statement for an annual meeting, our corporate secretary must receive the proposal at least 120 days prior to the anniversary of the date we mailed the proxy statement for the prior year s annual meeting. 
 
 To nominate directors, shareholders must submit a written notice to our corporate secretary at least 60 days, but not more than 85 days, before a scheduled meeting provided, however, that if less than 75 days notice or prior public disclosure of the date of the annual meeting is given or made to shareholders, such nomination shall have been received by our corporate secretary no later than the close of business on the 25th day following the day on which such notice of the date of the annual meeting was mailed or such public disclosure was made. The notice must include the name and address of the shareholder and of the shareholder s nominee, the number of shares held by the shareholder, a representation that the shareholder is a holder of record of common stock entitled to vote at the meeting, and that the shareholder intends to appear in person or by proxy to nominate the persons specified in the notice, a description of any arrangements between the shareholder and the shareholder s nominee, information about the shareholder s nominee required by the SEC and the written consent of the shareholder s nominee to serve as a director. 
 
 Shareholder proposals and director nominations that are late or that do not include all required information may be rejected. This could prevent shareholders from bringing certain matters before an annual or special meeting or making nominations for directors.
