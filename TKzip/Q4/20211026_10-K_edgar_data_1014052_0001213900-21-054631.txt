ITEM 1. BUSINESS. 

Overview 

Digerati
Technologies, Inc., a Nevada corporation (including our subsidiaries, we, us, Company or Digerati ),
through its operating subsidiaries in Texas and Florida, Shift8 Networks, Inc., dba, T3 Communications and T3 Communications, Inc. (both
referred to herein as T3 ), respectively, and Nexogy Inc., a Florida corporation, provides cloud services specializing in
Unified Communications as a Service UCaaS solutions for the business market. Our product line includes a portfolio of
Internet-based telephony products and services delivered through our cloud application platform and session-based communication network
and network services including Internet broadband, fiber, mobile broadband, and cloud WAN solutions (SD WAN). Our services are designed
to provide enterprise-class, carrier-grade services to the small-to-medium-sized business SMB at cost-effective monthly
rates. Our UCaaS or cloud communication services include fully hosted IP/PBX, mobile applications, Voice over Internet Protocol VoIP transport, SIP trunking, and customized VoIP services all delivered Only in the Cloud . 

As
a provider of cloud communications solutions to the SMB, we are seeking to capitalize on the migration by businesses from the legacy
telephone network to the Internet Protocol IP telecommunication network and the migration from hardware-based on-premise
telephone systems to software-based communication systems in the cloud. Most SMBs are lagging in technical capabilities and advancement
and seldom reach the economies of scale that their larger counterparts enjoy, due to their achievement of a critical mass and ability
to deploy a single solution to a large number of workers. SMBs are typically unable to afford comprehensive enterprise solutions and,
therefore, need to integrate a combination of business solutions to meet their needs. Cloud computing has revolutionized the industry
and opened the door for businesses of all sizes to gain access to enterprise applications with affordable pricing. This especially holds
true for cloud telephony applications, but SMBs are still a higher-touch sale that requires customer support for system integration,
network installation, cabling, and troubleshooting. We have placed a significant emphasis on that local touch when selling,
delivering, and supporting our services which we believe will differentiate us from the national providers that are experiencing high
attrition rates due to poor customer support. 

The
adoption of cloud communication services is being driven by the convergence of several market trends, including the increasing costs
of maintaining installed legacy communications systems, the fragmentation resulting from use of multiple on-premise systems, and the
proliferation of personal smartphones used in the workplace. Today, businesses are increasingly looking for an affordable path to modernizing
their communications system to improve productivity, business performance and customer experience. 

Our
cloud solutions offer the SMB reliable, robust, and full-featured services at affordable monthly rates that eliminates high-cost capital
expenditures and provides for integration with other cloud-based systems. 

Recent
Developments 

Acquisitions

On
November 17, 2020, the Company closed on the acquisitions of Nexogy, Inc. Nexogy ), and ActivePBX ActivePBX ),
leading providers of cloud communication, UCaaS, and broadband solutions tailored for businesses. As a combined business, Nexogy, ActivePBX,
and T3, will serve over 2,600 business customers and approximately 28,000 users. The business model of the combined entities is supported
by strong and predictable recurring revenue with high gross margins under contracts with business customers in various industries including
banking, healthcare, financial services, legal, insurance, hotels, real estate, staffing, municipalities, food services, and education.
The contribution from the acquisitions is expected to have an immediate and positive impact on the consolidated EBITDA of the Company
with additional improvements to be realized during FY2022 from the anticipated cost synergies and consolidation savings.

Products
and Services 

We
provide a comprehensive suite of cloud services specializing in Unified Communications as a Service UCaaS solutions for
the business market. Our product line includes a portfolio of Internet-based telephony products and services delivered through our cloud
application platform and session-based communication network and network services including Internet broadband, fiber, mobile broadband,
and cloud WAN or SD-WAN (Software-defined Wide Area Network) solutions. Our services are designed to provide enterprise-class, carrier-grade
services to the small-to-medium-sized business SMB at cost-effective monthly rates. Our UCaaS or cloud communication
services include fully hosted IP/PBX, mobile applications, Voice over Internet Protocol VoIP transport, SIP trunking,
and customized VoIP services all delivered Only in the Cloud . 

Voice
over Internet Protocol Networks 

The
basic technology of traditional telecommunications systems was designed for slow mechanical switches. Communications over the traditional
telephone network are routed through circuits that must dedicate all circuit resources to each call from its inception until the call
ends, regardless of whether anyone is actually talking on the circuit. This circuit-switching technology incurs a significant cost per
call and does not efficiently support the integration of voice with data services. Data networks, however, were designed for electronic
switching. They break the data stream into small, individually addressed packages of data packets that are routed independently
of each other from the origin to the destination. Therefore, they do not require a fixed amount of bandwidth to be reserved between the
origin and destination of each call and they do not waste bandwidth when it is not being used for actual transmission of information.
This allows multiple voice or voice and data calls to be pooled, resulting in these networks being able to carry more calls with an equal
amount of bandwidth. Moreover, they do not require the same complex switching methods required by traditional voice telephone networks,
instead using a multiplicity of routers to direct each packet to its destination and automatically routing packets around blockages,
congestion, or outages. 

Packet
switching can be used within a data network or across networks, including the public Internet. The Internet itself is not a single data
network owned by any single entity, but rather a loose interconnection of networks belonging to many owners that communicate using the
Internet Protocol. By converting voice signals to digital data and handling the voice signals as data, it can be transmitted through
the more efficient switching networks designed for data transmissions and through the Internet using the Internet Protocol. The transmission
of voice signals as digitalized data streams over the Internet is known as VoIP. A VoIP network has the following advantages over traditional
networks: 

Simplification:
 An integrated infrastructure that supports all forms of communication allows more standardization, a smaller equipment complement,
and less equipment management. 

Network
Efficiency: The integration of voice and data fills up the data communication channels efficiently, thus providing bandwidth consolidation
and reduction of the costs associated with idle bandwidth. This combined infrastructure can support dynamic bandwidth optimization and
a fault tolerant design. The differences between the traffic patterns of voice and data offer further opportunities for significant efficiency
improvements. 

Co-existence
with traditional communication mediums: IP telephony can be used in conjunction with existing public telephone system switches, leased
and dial-up lines, PBXs and other customer premise equipment, enterprise LANs, and Internet connections. IP telephony applications can
be implemented through dedicated gateways, which in turn can be based on open standards platforms for reliability and scalability. 

Cost
 reduction: Under the VoIP network, the connection is directly to the Internet backbone
 and as a result the telephony access charges, and settlement fees are avoided. 

The
growth of voice over the Internet was limited in the past due to poor sound quality caused by technical issues such as delays in packet
transmission and by bandwidth limitations related to Internet network capacity and local access constraints. However, the expansion of
Internet Protocol network infrastructure, improvements in packet switching and compression technology, new software algorithms and improved
hardware have substantially reduced delays in packet transmissions and resulted in superior sound quality to that of the legacy telephone
network. The continued improvement and expansion of the Internet Protocol network has resulted in the use of this technology for other
communication media, including video conferencing and instant messaging.

Cloud
Communications 

Cloud
communications are Internet-based voice and data communications where telecommunications applications, switching and storage are
hosted by a third-party service provider outside of the organization using the services. Services are accessed by the user over the public
Internet. Cloud telephony refers specifically to voice services and more specifically the replacement of conventional business
telephone equipment (such as a PBX) with VoIP service hosted by a third-party service provider and delivered over the Internet. 

We
operate a cloud communication network that consists of a VoIP switching system and cloud telephony application platform. Our network
allows us to provide end-to-end cloud telephony solutions designed to provide significant benefits to businesses of all sizes, with single
or multiple locations. The integration of our cloud communication platform and global VoIP network allows us to provide our customers
with virtually any type of telephony solution on a global basis. 

Our
cloud communication solutions, also known as UCaaS, are designed to minimize upfront capital costs, increase the scalability and flexibility
of the customer s communications network and service environment, provide robust features and functionality to increase productivity
and reduce the overall cost of communications. 

Strategy 

Our
strategy is to target the small to medium-sized business market and capitalize on the wave of migration from the legacy telephone network
to cloud telephony. We will continue to concentrate our sales and marketing efforts on developing vertically oriented solutions for targeted
markets primarily focusing on municipalities, banking, healthcare, legal services, and real estate. In addition, we will continue to
partner with our distributors and Value-Added Resellers VARs to expand our customer base. Our typical VAR, also referred
to as a Partner, is an information technology services firm, traditional PBX vendor, managed service provider, or systems integrator
that has established relationships with businesses in its local market. These VARs are currently providing local customer support for
other IT or PBX services but lack the technology infrastructure to provide cloud communication and VoIP services to their customers.
Our strategy allows these VARs to focus on their strength of providing first tier support to their customers while we provide the second
and third tier technical support required to operate a cloud communication and VoIP network. In addition, we transform our VARs 
business model by introducing new cloud telephony services and adding a new and lucrative recurring revenue stream that increases the
VARs value proposition for its current and prospective customers. 

Our
cloud-based technology platform enables us and our VARs to deliver enhanced voice services to their business customers. The features
supported on our cloud communication platform include all standard telephone features and value-added applications such as voicemail
to email, VoIP peering, teleconferencing, IVR auto attendant, and dial-by-name directory. Our system provides our customers and VARs
with a migration path from a traditional PBX system to a complete cloud-based PBX solution. 

Our
strategic initiatives to successfully meet our long-term business objectives include: 

A
 disciplined approach to evaluating additional acquisitions as we build on the foundation
 created by our acquisitions in Florida in FY2021. We will continue to target local and/or
 regional UCaaS/cloud telephony providers which have excelled in their market with that local 
 touch when serving their business customers. We believe the experience gained in integrating
 products, personnel, and customers will facilitate continued growth via acquisition. 

A
 continued emphasis on our UCaaS/cloud communication business which operates in a segment
 of the telecommunication industry that continues to experience significant growth as businesses
 migrate from legacy phone systems to cloud-based telephony systems. 

Enhancements
 to our broadband product portfolio with an emphasis on marketing leading-edge network and
 business continuity solutions like cloud WAN, also known as SD-WAN (Software Defined Wide-Area
 Network), to our customers which we anticipate will increase average revenue per customer. 

Implementing
 a total support model (pre and post sales) for building a world-class service delivery and
 help desk organization. 

3 

Emphasis
 on our sales distribution model that enables our VARs/Partners to offer cloud and session-based
 communication services to the enterprise market in various regions and industries. 

Continue
 enhancing our infrastructure and back-office system to streamline operations, automate key
 processes, and support the scalability of our VAR/Partner distribution model. 

Competitive
Conditions 

The
cloud services industry, including the provisioning of cloud communications services, cloud connectivity, cloud storage and cloud computing,
as well as carrier voice and data services, is highly competitive, rapidly evolving and subject to constant technological change and
intense marketing by providers with similar products and services. We expect that new, smaller, but very agile competitors, specializing
in providing service to regional and emerging markets at low margin and hence low cost, may have an impact on our market. Similarly,
the business services market includes competitors who may be significantly larger and have substantially greater market presence, financial,
technical, operational and marketing resources than we do, including Tier 1 carriers, cable companies and premise-based solutions providers
that are implementing cloud communication services. In the event that such a competitor expends significant sales and marketing resources
in one or several markets where we compete with them, we may not be able to compete successfully in those markets. Specialized cloud
services providers, who focus on one or more cloud service or application, could adopt aggressive pricing and promotion practices that
could impact our ability to compete. We also believe that competition will continue to increase, placing downward pressure on prices.
Such pressure could adversely affect our gross margins if we are not able to reduce our costs commensurate with the price reductions
of our competitors. In addition, the pace of technological change makes it impossible for us to predict whether we will face new competitors
using different technologies to provide the same or similar services offered or proposed to be offered by us. If our competitors were
to provide better and more cost-effective services than ours, we may not be able to increase our revenues or capture any significant
market share. 

The
VoIP and Internet telephony market are highly competitive. Our competitors include major telecommunications carriers in the U.S., national
UCaaS providers, and numerous small cloud telephony operators. We expect to face continuing competition based on price and service offerings
from existing competitors and new market entrants in the future. The principal competitive factors in our market include price, coverage,
customer service, technical response times, reliability, and network size/capacity. The competitive landscape is rapidly altering the
number, identity, and competitiveness of the marketplace, and we are unable to determine with certainty the impact of potential consolidation
in our industry. 

Many
of our competitors have substantially greater financial, technical, and marketing resources, larger customer bases, longer operating
histories, greater name recognition and more established relationships in the industry than we have. As a result, certain of these competitors
may be able to adopt more aggressive pricing policies that could hinder our ability to market our services. We believe that our key competitive
advantages are our ability to deliver reliable, high quality voice service over the Internet in a cost-effective manner, superior customers
service and our VAR distribution model. We cannot provide assurances, however, that these advantages will enable us to succeed against
comparable service offerings from our competitors. 

Government
Regulation 

As
a provider of Internet voice communications services, we are subject to regulation in the U.S. by the FCC. Some of these regulatory obligations
include contributing to the Federal Universal Service Fund, Telecommunications Relay Service Fund and federal programs related to number
administration; providing access to E-911 services; protecting customer information; and porting phone numbers upon a valid customer
request. We are also required to pay state and local 911 fees and contribute to state universal service funds in those states that assess
Internet voice communications services. We are a competitive local exchange carrier (CLEC) in Florida. We are subject to the same FCC
regulations applicable to telecommunications companies, as well as regulation by the public utility commission in these states. Specific
regulations vary on a state-by-state basis, but generally include the requirement to register or seek certification to provide telephone
services, to file and update tariffs setting forth the terms, conditions, and prices for our intrastate services and to comply with various
reporting, record-keeping, surcharge collection, and consumer protection requirements. 

4 

The
effect of any future laws, regulations, and orders on our operations, including, but not limited to, our cloud-based communications and
collaboration services, cannot be determined. But as a general matter, increased regulation and the imposition of additional funding
obligations increases service costs that may or may not be recoverable from our customers, which could result in making our services
less competitive with traditional telecommunications services if we increase our prices or decreasing our profit margins if we attempt
to absorb such costs. 

Federal,
state, local and foreign governmental organizations are considering other legislative and regulatory proposals that would regulate and/or
tax applications running over the Internet. We cannot predict whether new taxes will be imposed on our services, and depending on the
type of taxes imposed, whether and how our services would be affected thereafter. Increased regulation of the Internet may decrease its
growth and hinder technological development, which may negatively impact the cost of doing business via the Internet or otherwise materially
adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 

Regulation
of Internet-based Telecommunication Services in the United States 

We
have the necessary authority under Section 214 of the Communications Act to operate as a domestic and international telecommunications
carrier. We are considered a non-dominant domestic interstate carrier subject to minimal regulation by the FCC. We are not required to
obtain FCC authority to initiate or expand our domestic interstate operations, but we are required to obtain FCC approval to transfer
control or discontinue service and are required to file various reports and pay various fees and assessments. In addition, we must offer
service on a nondiscriminatory basis at just and reasonable rates and are subject to the FCC s complaint jurisdiction. Generally,
our international voice traffic is subject to minimal regulation by state and local jurisdictions. 

As
a competitive local exchange carrier (CLEC) in Florida. We are subject to the same FCC regulations applicable to telecommunications companies,
as well as regulation by the public utility commission in Florida. As a CLEC, we are generally required to register or seek certification
to provide certain services, to file and update tariffs setting forth the terms, conditions and prices for our intrastate services and
to comply with various consumer protection, reporting, record-keeping, surcharge collection requirements. 

The
FCC requires Internet voice communications service providers, such as our company, to provide E-911 service in all geographic areas covered
by the traditional wire-line E-911 network. Under the FCC s rules, Internet voice communications providers must transmit the caller s
phone number and registered location information to the appropriate public safety answering point, or PSAP, for the caller s registered
location. The FCC also requires interconnected VoIP service providers to make Universal Service Fund USF contributions.
We believe that our services are currently compliant with all applicable requirements of the FCC, and we have made and are making the
required contributions to the USF. However, should we at some time fail to meet certain requirements or fail to make required contributions,
we could be subject to revocation of our authority to operate or to fines or penalties. 

As
a result of the FCC s preemption of states ability to regulate certain aspects of VoIP service, and a trend in state legislatures
to affirmatively deregulate VoIP services for most purposes, our VoIP services are subject to relatively few state regulatory requirements,
aside from collection of state and local E911 fees and state Universal Service support obligations as well as some state communication
service and sales taxes, when applicable. We believe that our VoIP services are currently compliant with all applicable state requirements,
and we have made and are making the required contributions to E911, state USF, and other funds. The state regulatory framework for our
VoIP services continues to evolve, so we, in conjunction with our professional advisors, monitor the actions of the various state regulatory
agencies and endeavor to ensure that we are in compliance with applicable state law, including any new statutes or regulations that may
be passed. However, there can be no assurance that we will become aware of all applicable requirements on a timely basis, or that we
will always be fully compliant with applicable rules and regulations. Should we fail to be compliant with applicable state regulations,
or to file required reports with state regulatory agencies, we could be subject to fines and/or penalties. 

In
addition to regulations addressing Internet telephony and broadband services, other regulatory issues relating to the Internet generally
could affect our ability to provide our services. Congress has adopted legislation that regulates certain aspects of the Internet including
online content, user privacy, taxation, liability for third-party activities and jurisdiction. In addition, a number of initiatives pending
in Congress and state legislatures would prohibit or restrict advertising or sale of certain products and services on the Internet, which
may have the effect of raising the cost of doing business on the Internet generally. 

International
Regulation 

The
regulatory treatment of Internet telephony outside of the U.S. varies widely from country to country. A number of countries that currently
prohibit competition in the provision of voice telephony also prohibit Internet telephony. Other countries permit but regulate Internet
telephony. Some countries will evaluate proposed Internet telephony service on a case-by-case basis and determine whether it should be
regulated as a voice service or as another telecommunications service. In many countries, Internet telephony has not yet been addressed
by legislation or regulation. Increased regulation of the Internet and/or Internet telephony providers or the prohibition of Internet
telephony in one or more countries could adversely affect our business and future prospects if we decide to expand globally.

Customers
and Suppliers 

We
rely on various suppliers to provide services in connection with our VoIP and UCaaS offerings. Our customers include businesses in various
industries including Healthcare, Banking, Financial Services, Legal, Real Estate, and Construction. We are not dependent upon any single
supplier or customer. 

During
the years ended July 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company did not derive a significant amount of revenue from one single customer. 

As
of the year ended July 31, 2021, the Company did not derive a significant number of accounts receivable from one single customer. During
the year ended July 31, 2020, the company derived 12 of total accounts receivable from one customer. 

Employees 

As
of July 31, 2021, we had 46 employees, all of whom performed sales, operational, technical, and administrative functions. We believe
our future success will depend to a large extent on our continued ability to attract and retain highly skilled and qualified employees.
We consider our employee relations to be good. None of these aforementioned employees belong to labor unions.

providers of cloud communication, UCaaS, and broadband solutions tailored for businesses. As a combined business, Nexogy, ActivePBX,

to the year ended July 31, 2021. The increase in revenue is primarily attributed to the increase in total customers between years due
to the acquisitions of Nexogy and ActivePBX. Our total number of customers increased from 728 for the year ended July 31, 2020, to 2,655
customers for the year ended July 31, 2021.

of Services (exclusive of depreciation and amortization). The cost of services increased by 2,100,000, or 69 from the year ended
July 31, 2020, to the year ended July 31, 2021. The increase in cost of services is primarily attributed to the consolidation of various
networks and key vendors as part of the increase in total customers between periods due to the acquisitions of Nexogy and ActivePBX.

Stock
Compensation expense. Stock compensation expense decreased by 504,000, or 45 from the year ended July 31, 2020, to the year ended
July 31, 2021. The decrease between periods is attributed to the recognition of stock option expense of 377,000 recognized during the

FY2018, FY2019 and FY2020. The Company also recognized 501,000 in stock compensation for stock issued in lieu of cash payments to the

July 31, 2021. The increase between periods is attributed to the recognition during the period ending July 31, 2021, of 611,000 in legal
and professional fees related to due diligence, audits for the acquisitions, purchase price allocation and investor relations.

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

Cash
Position: We had a consolidated cash balance of 1,489,000 as of July 31, 2021. Net cash consumed by operating activities during
the year ended July 31, 2021 was approximately 708,000, primarily as a result of operating expenses, that included 624,000 in stock

Cash
used in investing activities during the year ended July 31, 2021 was 10,800,000, which included 410,000 for the purchase of equipment
and the cash paid of 10,390,000, net of cash received, for the acquisitions of VoIP assets from Nexogy and ActivePBX. 

Cash
provided by financing activities during the year ended July 31, 2021, was 12,312,000. The Company secured 1,078,000 from convertible
notes, net of issuance costs and discounts. In addition, the Company secured 13,036,000 from two promissory notes, net of issuance costs.
 (See Note10) The Company made principal payments of 1,338,000 on various notes, principal payments of 266,000 on convertible
notes, principal payments of 169,000 on related party notes, and 63,000 in principal payments on equipment financing. Overall, our
net operating, investing, and financing activities during the year ended July 31, 2021, contributed approximately 804,000 of our available
cash. 

Digerati s
consolidated financial statements for the year ending July 31, 2021, have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates
the realization of assets and the settlement of liabilities in the normal course of business. Since the Company s inception in 1993,
Digerati has incurred net losses and accumulated a deficit of approximately 105,380,000 and a working capital deficit of approximately
 24,228,000 which raises doubt about Digerati s ability to continue as a going concern. 

We
are currently taking initiatives to reduce our overall cash deficiencies on a monthly basis. During fiscal 2021 certain members of our
management team have taken a significant portion of their compensation in common stock to reduce the depletion of our available cash.
To strengthen our business, we intend to adopt best practices from or recent acquisitions and invest in a marketing and sales strategy
to grow our monthly recurring revenue; we anticipate utilizing our value-added resellers and channel partners to tap into new sources
of revenue streams, we have also secured various agent agreements to accelerate revenue growth. In addition, we will continue to focus
on selling a greater number of comprehensive services to our existing customer base. Further, in an effort to increase our revenues,
we will continue to evaluate the acquisition of various assets with emphasis in VoIP Services and Cloud Communication Services. As a
result, during the due diligence process we anticipate incurring significant legal and professional fees. 

11 

Management
believes that available resources as of July 31, 2021, will not be sufficient to fund the Company s operations, debt service and
corporate expenses over the next 12 months. The Company s ability to continue to meet its obligations and to achieve its business
objectives is dependent upon, and other things, raising additional capital, issuing stock-based compensation to certain members of the
executive management team in lieu of cash, or generating sufficient revenue in excess of costs. At such time as the Company requires
additional funding, the Company will seek to secure such best-efforts funding from various possible sources, including equity or debt
financing, sales of assets, or collaborative arrangements. If the Company raises additional capital through the issuance of equity securities
or securities convertible into equity, stockholders will experience dilution, and such securities may have rights, preferences, or privileges
senior to those of the holders of common stock or convertible senior notes. If the Company raises additional funds by issuing debt, the
Company may be subject to limitations on its operations, through debt covenants or other restrictions. If the Company obtains additional
funds through arrangements with collaborators or strategic partners, the Company may be required to relinquish its rights to certain
technologies. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to raise additional funds or raise them on acceptable terms. If
the Company is unable to obtain financing on acceptable terms, it may be unable to execute its business plan, the Company could be required
to curtail its operations, and the Company may not be able to pay off its obligations, if and when they come due. 

Our
current cash expenses are expected to be approximately 700,000 per month, including wages, rent, utilities, corporate expenses, and
legal professional fees associated with potential acquisitions. As described elsewhere herein, we are not generating sufficient cash
from operations to pay for our corporate and ongoing operating expenses, or to pay our current liabilities. As of July 31, 2021, our
total liabilities were approximately 33,375,000, which included 16,773,000 in derivative liabilities. We will continue to use our available
cash on hand to cover our deficiencies in operating expenses. 

We
estimate that we need approximately 80,000 per month of additional working capital to fund our corporate expenses during Fiscal 2022. 

We
have been successful in raising debt capital and equity capital in the past and as described in Notes 10, 11, and 12 to our consolidated
financial statements. We have financing efforts in place to continue to raise cash through debt and equity offerings. Although we have
successfully completed financings and reduced expenses in the past, we cannot assure you that our plans to address these matters in the
future will be successful. 

Critical
Accounting Policies 

Revenue
Recognition. On August 1, 2018, we adopted Topic 606 using the modified retrospective method applied to those contracts which were
not completed as of August 1, 2018. Results for reporting periods beginning after August 1, 2018 are presented under Topic 606. There
was no impact to the opening balance of accumulated deficit or revenues for the year ended July 31, 2019 as a result of applying Topic
606. 

The
Company recognizes cloud-based hosted services revenue, mainly from subscription services for its cloud telephony applications that includes
hosted IP/PBX services, SIP trunking, call center applications, auto attendant, voice and web conferencing, call recording, messaging,
voicemail to email conversion, integrated mobility applications that are device and location agnostic, and other customized applications.
Other services include enterprise-class data and connectivity solutions through multiple broadband technologies including cloud WAN or
SD-WAN (Software-defined Wide Area Network), fiber, and Ethernet over copper. We also offer remote network monitoring, data backup and
disaster recovery services. The Company applies a five-step approach in determining the amount and timing of revenue to be recognized:
(1) identifying the contract with a customer, (2) identifying the performance obligations in the contract, (3) determining the transaction
price, (4) allocating the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract and (5) recognizing revenue when the performance
obligation is satisfied. Substantially all of the Company s revenue is recognized at the time control of the products transfers
to the customer. 

Service Revenue 

Service
revenue from subscriptions to the Company s cloud-based technology platform is recognized over time on a ratable basis over the contractual
subscription term beginning on the date that the platform is made available to the customer. Payments received in advance of subscription
services being rendered are recorded as a deferred revenue. Usage fees, either bundled or not bundled, are recognized when the Company
has a right to invoice. Professional services for configuration, system integration, optimization, customer training and/or education
are primarily billed on a fixed-fee basis and are performed by the Company directly. Alternatively, customers may choose to perform these
services themselves or engage their own third-party service providers. Professional services revenue is recognized over time, generally
as services are activated for the customer. 

12 

Product
Revenue 

The
Company recognizes product revenue for telephony equipment at a point in time, when transfer of control has occurred, which is generally
upon delivery. Sales returns are recorded as a reduction to revenue estimated based on historical experience. 

Goodwill, Intangible
Assets, and Long-Lived Assets. Goodwill is carried at cost and is not amortized. The Company tests goodwill for impairment on an
annual basis at the end of each fiscal year, relying on a number of factors including operating results, business plans, economic projections,
anticipated future cash flows and marketplace data. Company management uses its judgment in assessing whether goodwill has become impaired
between annual impairment tests according to specifications set forth in ASC 350. The Company completed an evaluation of goodwill at
July 31, 2021 and 2020 and determined that there was no impairment. 

The
fair value of the Company s reporting unit is dependent upon the Company s estimate of future cash flows and other factors.
The Company s estimates of future cash flows include assumptions concerning future operating performance and economic conditions
and may differ from actual future cash flows. Estimated future cash flows are adjusted by an appropriate discount rate derived from the
Company s market capitalization plus a suitable control premium at date of the evaluation. 

The
financial and credit market volatility directly impacts the Company s fair value measurement through the Company s weighted
average cost of capital that the Company uses to determine its discount rate and through the Company s stock price that the Company
uses to determine its market capitalization. Therefore, changes in the stock price may also affect the amount of impairment recorded. 

The
Company recognizes an acquired intangible asset apart from goodwill whenever the intangible asset arises from contractual or other legal
rights, or when it can be separated or divided from the acquired entity and sold, transferred, licensed, rented or exchanged, either
individually or in combination with a related contract, asset or liability. Such intangibles are amortized over their useful lives. Impairment
losses are recognized if the carrying amount of an intangible asset subject to amortization is not recoverable from expected future cash
flows and its carrying amount exceeds its fair value. 

The
Company reviews its long-lived assets, including property and equipment, identifiable intangibles, and goodwill annually or whenever
events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable. To determine recoverability
of its long-lived assets, the Company evaluates the probability that future undiscounted net cash flows will be less than the carrying
amount of the assets. 

Business
combinations. Each investment in a business is being measured and determined whether the investment should be accounted for as a
cost-basis investment, an equity investment, a business combination, or a common control transaction. An investment in which the Company
do not have a controlling interest and which the Company is not the primary beneficiary but where the Company has the ability to exert
significant influence is accounted for under the equity method of accounting. For those investments that we account for in accordance
ASC 805, Business Combinations, the Company records the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the management s estimate of
their fair values on the date of the business combination. The assessment of the estimated fair value of each of these can have a material
effect on the reported results as intangible assets are amortized over various lives. Furthermore, according to ASC 805-50-30-5, when
accounting for a transfer of assets or exchange of shares between entities under common control, the entity that receives the net assets
or the equity interests shall initially measure the recognized assets and liabilities transferred at their carrying amounts in the accounts
of the transferring entity at the date of transfer. 

Stock-based
compensation. In June 2018 FASB adopted the Accounting Standards Update No. 2018-07, Compensation Stock
Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Non-employee Share-Based Payment Accounting. This update simplifies the accounting
for non-employee share-based payment transactions by expanding the scope of Topic 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation, to include share-based
payment transactions for acquiring goods and services from non-employees. The guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after
December 15, 2018, and interim periods within that reporting period. The Company adopted the updated standard as of May 1, 2018,
adopting this guidance did not have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements. During FY 2021 and 2020, the Company
issued 7,858,820 common shares and 21,811,100 common shares, respectively to various employees as part of our profit sharing-plan contribution
and stock in lieu of cash. At the time of issuance during FY 2021 and 2020 we recognized stock-based compensation expense of 264,712
and 801,891, respectively equivalent to the market value of the shares issued calculated based on the share s closing price at the grant
dates.

Treasury
Shares. As a result of entering into various convertible debt instruments which contained a variable conversion feature with no floor,
warrants with fixed exercise price, and convertible notes with fixed conversion price or with a conversion price floor, we reserved 25,000,000
treasury shares for consideration for future conversions and exercise of warrants. The Company will evaluate the reserved treasury shares
on a quarterly basis, and if necessary, reserve additional treasury shares. As of July 31, 2021, we believe that the treasury share reserved
are sufficient for any future conversions of these instruments. As a result, these debt instruments and warrants are excluded from derivative
consideration. 

Derivative
financial instruments . Digerati does not use derivative instruments to hedge exposures to cash flow, market, or foreign currency
risks. However, Digerati analyzes its convertible instruments and free-standing instruments such as warrants for derivative liability
accounting. 

For
derivative financial instruments that are accounted for as liabilities, the derivative instrument is initially recorded at its fair value
and is then re-valued at each reporting date. Any changes in fair value is recorded as non-operating, non-cash income or expense for
each reporting period. For derivative notes payable conversion options Digerati uses the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to value
the derivative instruments. 

The
classification of derivative instruments, including whether such instruments should be recorded as liabilities or as equity, is re-assessed
at the end of each reporting period. Derivative instrument liabilities are classified in the balance sheet as current or non-current
based on whether or not net-cash settlement of the derivative instrument is probable within the next 12 months from the balance sheet
date. 

Fair
Value of Financial Instruments. Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer
a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between
market participants on the measurement date. A fair value hierarchy is used which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable
inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. The fair value hierarchy based on the three levels of inputs
that may be used to measure fair value are as follows: 

Level
 1 Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets
 or liabilities. 

Level
 2 Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar
 assets or liabilities; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable
 market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. 

Level
 3 Unobservable
 inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are financial instruments
 whose values are determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, or
 similar techniques, as well as instruments for which the determination of fair value requires
 significant judgment or estimation. 

For
certain of our financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses,
the carrying amounts approximate fair value due to the short maturity of these instruments. The carrying value of our long-term debt
approximates its fair value based on the quoted market prices for the same or similar issues or the current rates offered to us for debt
of the same remaining maturities.

REPORT
OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

To
the Shareholders and Board of Directors of 

Digerati
Technologies, Inc. 

Opinion
on the Financial Statements 

We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Digerati Technologies, Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively, the Company as of July 31, 2021 and July 31, 2020, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders deficit, and cash flows
for the years then ended, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements ). In our opinion,
the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of July 31, 2021 and July
31, 2020, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America. 

Going
Concern Matter 

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note
[2] to the financial statements, the Company has suffered recurring losses from operations and has a net capital deficiency that raises
substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management s plans in regard to these matters are also described
in Note [2]. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

Basis
for Opinion 

These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s
financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal
securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company
is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits
we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion
on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our
audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error
or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

Critical
Audit Matters 

Critical
audit matters are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be
communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and
(2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgements. We determined that there are no critical audit matters.

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

In accordance with Exchange
Act Rules 13a-15 and 15a-15, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of management, including
our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end
of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that
our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of July 31, 2021. 

Management s Report on Internal Control
over Financial Reporting 

Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial
reporting is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as a process designed
by, or under the supervision of, the Company s principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by the Company s
Board, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation
of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
and includes those policies and procedures that: 

Pertain to the maintenance of
records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; 

Provide reasonable assurance
that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations
of management and directors of the company; and 

Provide reasonable assurance
regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company s assets that could have
a material effect on the financial statements. 

Because of its inherent
limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness
to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations.
Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation
and presentation. Because of the inherent limitations of internal control, there is a risk that material misstatements may not be prevented
or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting. However, these inherent limitations are known features of
the financial reporting process. Therefore, it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce, though not eliminate, this
risk. 

15 

As of July 31, 2021, management assessed the effectiveness
of our internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting established
in Internal Control--Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO and SEC guidance on conducting such assessments. Based on that evaluation, management concluded that, during the period covered by this
report; such internal controls and procedures were not effective based on the COSO criteria. This was due to deficiencies that existed
in the design or operation of our internal controls over financial reporting that adversely affected our internal controls and that may
be considered to be material weaknesses. 

The matters involving
internal controls and procedures that our management considered to be material weaknesses were: 

1. We do not have sufficient segregation of duties within accounting functions, which is a basic internal
control. We lack multiple levels of review over financial reporting. Due to our size and nature, segregation of all conflicting duties
may not always be possible and may not be economically feasible. However, to the extent possible, the initiation of transactions, the
custody of assets and the recording of transactions should be performed by separate individuals. Management evaluated the impact of our
failure to have segregation of duties on our assessment of our disclosure controls and procedures and concluded that the controls deficiency
and lack of multiple levels of review over financial reporting represented a material weakness. 

The aforementioned material
weaknesses were identified by our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer in connection with the review of our internal statements
as of July 31, 2021. 

Management s Remediation
Initiatives 

In an effort to remediate
the identified material weaknesses and other deficiencies and enhance our internal controls, we plan to initiate the following: 

1. We plan to create a position to segregate duties consistent with controls objectives and to increase our
personnel resources and technical accounting expertise within the accounting function. In addition, we intend to improve the supervision
and training of our accounting personnel. 

We are continuing our efforts
to improve and strengthen our control processes and procedures to fully remedy these deficiencies. Our management and directors will continue
to work with our auditors and other outside advisors to ensure that our controls and procedures are adequate and effective. 

The
Company is not required by current SEC rules to include and does not include an auditor s attestation report. The Company s registered
public accounting firm has not attested to management s reports on the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

Compensation Discussion and Analysis 

Our compensation programs
are designed to meet the following objectives: 

Offer compensation opportunities that attract highly qualified executives, reward outstanding initiative
and achievement, and retain the leadership and skills necessary to build long-term stockholder value; 

Emphasize pay-for-performance by maintaining a portion of executives total compensation at risk,
tied to both our annual and long-term financial performance and the creation of stockholder value; and 

Further our short and long-term strategic goals and values by aligning executive officer compensation
with business objectives and individual performance. 

Our Board of Directors believes
that an executive s compensation should be tied to the performance of the individual and the performance of the complete executive
team against both financial and non-financial goals, some of which are subjective and within the discretion of the Board of Directors. 

Our executive compensation
program is intended to be simple and clear, and consists of the following elements (depending on individual performance): 

Base salary; 

Annual performance-based cash bonus; 

Long-term incentives in the form of stock options; and 

Benefits that are offered to executives on the same basis as our non-executive employees. 

Role of Management in Determining Compensation
Decisions 

At the request of our Board
of Directors, our management makes recommendations to our Board of Directors relating to executive compensation program design, specific
compensation amounts, bonus targets, incentive plan structure and other executive compensation related matters for each of our executive
officers, including our Chief Executive Officer. Our Board of Directors maintains decision-making authority with respect to these executive
compensation matters. 

Our Board of Directors reviews
the recommendations of our management with respect to total executive compensation and each element of compensation when making pay decisions.
In allocating compensation among compensation elements, we emphasize incentive, not fixed compensation to ensure that executives only
receive superior pay for superior results. We equally value short- and long-term compensation because both short- and long-term results
are critical to our success. In addition, our compensation program includes various benefits provided to all employees, including life
insurance, health insurance and other customary benefits. The objectives and details of why each element of compensation is paid are described
below. 

Base Salary. Our objective
for paying base salaries to executives is to reward them for performing the core responsibilities of their positions and to provide a
level of security with respect to a portion of their compensation. We consider a number of factors when setting base salaries for executives,
including: 

Existing salary levels; 

Competitive pay practices; 

Individual and corporate performance; and 

Internal equity among our executives, taking into consideration their relative contributions to our success. 

21 

Long-term Incentive Awards.
 We award long-term incentive compensation to focus our executives on our long-term growth and stockholder return, as well as to encourage
our executives to remain with us for the long-term. Long-term incentive awards are primarily in the form of grants of stock options and/or
stock award pursuant to our 2015 Equity Compensation Plan (the Plan ). We selected this form because of the favorable accounting
and tax treatment and the expectation of key employees in our industry that they would receive stock options and/or stock grants. We do
not have pre-established target award amounts for long-term incentive grants. In determining long-term incentive awards for the Named
Executive Officers, our Board of Directors relies on recommendations from our Chief Executive Officer, who considers the individual performance
of the executives, the relation of the award to base salary and annual incentive compensation and associated accounting expense. The terms
of and amount of awards are made by our Board of Directors in accordance with the Stock Option Plan. 

Executive Compensation 

The following table sets forth
the compensation paid to each of our principal executive officers (the Named Executive Officers during the last two completed

since our inception and do not intend to pay any dividends in the foreseeable future. 

The declaration of any future cash dividends is
at the discretion of our board of directors and depends upon our earnings, if any, our capital requirements and financial position, our
general economic conditions, and other pertinent conditions. It is our present intention not to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable
future, but rather to reinvest earnings, if any, in our business operations. 

Warrants 

As of October 25, 2021, we have issued warrants
to purchase 109,506,179 shares of Common Stock issuable with a weighted average exercise price of 0.01. Of which 82,280,885 warrants
are exercisable immediately, have a weighted-average remaining life of 9.15 years and a weighted-average exercise price of 0.01 as of
October 25, 2021. 

Options 

As of October 25, 2021, we have issued options
to purchase 9,230,000 shares of Common Stock issuable with a weighted average exercise price of 0.17. Of which 6,091,863 options are
exercisable immediately, have a weighted-average remaining life of 2.18 years and a weighted-average exercise price of 0.23 as of October
25, 2021. 

Securities Authorized for Issuance Under Equity Compensation Plans 

In November 2015, Digerati adopted the Digerati
Technologies, Inc. 2015 Equity Compensation Plan (the Plan ). The Plan authorizes the grant of up to 7.5 million stock options,
restricted common shares, non-restricted common shares and other awards to employees, directors, and certain other persons. The Plan is
intended to permit Digerati to retain and attract qualified individuals who will contribute to the overall success of Digerati. Digerati s
Board of Directors determines the terms of any grants under the Plan. Exercise prices of all stock options and other awards vary based
on the market price of the shares of common stock as of the date of grant. The stock options, restricted common stock, non-restricted
common stock and other awards vest based on the terms of the individual grant. On November 18, 2015, the Company filed a Registration
Statement on Form S-8 to register with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission 7,500,000 shares of the Company s common stock,
which may be issued by the Company upon the exercise of options granted, or other awards made, pursuant to the terms of the Plan. Please
see the Plan filed as Exhibit 4.1 to the Company s Registration Statement on Form S-8 filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission on November 18, 2015.

Preferred Stock 

The Company has authorized 50,000,000 shares of
preferred stock. The board of directors has the authority to issue these shares and to set dividends, voting and conversion rights, redemption
provisions, liquidation preferences, and other rights and restrictions. 

Anti-Takeover Effects of Various Provisions of Nevada Law 

Provisions of the Nevada Revised Statutes, our
articles of incorporation, as amended, and bylaws could make it more difficult to acquire us by means of a tender offer, a proxy contest
or otherwise, or to remove incumbent officers and directors. These provisions, summarized below, would be expected to discourage certain
types of takeover practices and takeover bids our Board may consider inadequate and to encourage persons seeking to acquire control of
us to first negotiate with us. We believe that the benefits of increased protection of our ability to negotiate with the proponent of
an unfriendly or unsolicited proposal to acquire or restructure us will outweigh the disadvantages of discouraging takeover or acquisition
proposals because, among other things, negotiation of these proposals could result in an improvement of their terms. 

Blank Check Preferred 

Our articles of incorporation permit our Board
to issue preferred stock with voting, conversion and exchange rights that could negatively affect the voting power or other rights of
our Common Stockholders. The issuance of our preferred stock could delay or prevent a change of control of our Company. 

Amendments to our Articles of Incorporation
and Bylaws 

Under the Nevada Revised Statutes, our articles
of incorporation may not be amended by stockholder action alone. 

Nevada Anti-Takeover Statute 

We may be subject to Nevada s Combination
with Interested Stockholders Statute (Nevada Corporation Law Sections 78.411-78.444) which prohibits an interested stockholder 
from entering into a combination with the corporation, unless certain conditions are met. An interested stockholder 
is a person who, together with affiliates and associates, beneficially owns (or within the prior two years, did beneficially own) 10 
or more of the corporation s capital stock entitled to vote. 

Limitations on Liability and Indemnification
of Officers and Directors 

The Nevada Revised Statutes limits or eliminates
the personal liability of directors to corporations and their stockholders for monetary damages for breaches of directors fiduciary
duties as directors. 

The limitation of liability and indemnification
provisions under the Nevada Revised Statutes and in our articles of incorporation and bylaws may discourage stockholders from bringing
a lawsuit against directors for breach of their fiduciary duties. These provisions may also have the effect of reducing the likelihood
of derivative litigation against directors and officers, even though such an action, if successful, might otherwise benefit us and our
stockholders. However, these provisions do not limit or eliminate our rights, or those of any stockholder, to seek non-monetary relief
such as injunction or rescission in the event of a breach of a director s fiduciary duties. Moreover, the provisions do not alter
the liability of directors under the federal securities laws. In addition, your investment may be adversely affected to the extent that,
in a class action or direct suit, we pay the costs of settlement and damage awards against directors and officers pursuant to these indemnification
provisions. 

2 

Authorized but Unissued Shares 

Our authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock
and preferred stock will be available for future issuance without stockholder approval, except as may be required under the listing rules
of any stock exchange on which our Common Stock is then listed. We may use additional shares for a variety of corporate purposes, including
future public offerings to raise additional capital, corporate acquisitions and employee benefit plans. The existence of authorized but
unissued shares of Common Stock and preferred stock could render more difficult or discourage an attempt to obtain control of us by means
of a proxy contest, tender offer, merger or otherwise. 

Penny Stock Considerations 

Our shares will be penny stocks 
as that term is generally defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to mean equity securities with a price of less than 5.00 per
share. Thus, our shares will be subject to rules that impose sales practice and disclosure requirements on broker-dealers who engage in
certain transactions involving a penny stock. Under the penny stock regulations, a broker-dealer selling a penny stock to anyone other
than an established customer must make a special suitability determination regarding the purchaser and must receive the purchaser s
written consent to the transaction prior to the sale, unless the broker-dealer is otherwise exempt. 

In addition, under the penny stock regulations,
the broker-dealer is required to: 

Deliver, prior to any transaction involving a penny stock, a disclosure schedule prepared by the Securities and Exchange Commission relating to the penny stock market, unless the broker-dealer or the transaction is otherwise exempt; 

Disclose commissions payable to the broker-dealer and our registered representatives and current bid and offer quotations for the securities; 

Send monthly statements disclosing recent price information pertaining to the penny stock held in a customer s account, the account s value, and information regarding the limited market in penny stocks; and 

Make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser s written agreement to the transaction, prior to conducting any penny stock transaction in the customer s account. 

Because of these regulations, broker-dealers may
encounter difficulties in their attempt to sell shares of our common stock, which may affect the ability of selling shareholders or other
holders to sell their shares in the secondary market and have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity in the secondary market.
These additional sales practice and disclosure requirements could impede the sale of our securities, if our securities become publicly
traded. In addition, the liquidity for our securities may be decreased, with a corresponding decrease in the price of our securities.
Our shares in all probability will be subject to such penny stock rules and our shareholders will, in all likelihood, find it difficult
to sell their securities.
