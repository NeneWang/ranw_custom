ITEM
1. Business 

Our
Company 

BorrowMoney.com,
Inc. BorrowMoney.com , the Company , we or us operates what we believe to be
the leading online loan marketplace for consumers seeking loans and other credit-based offerings. Our online marketplace provides consumers
with access to product offerings from active lenders (which we refer to as Network Lenders ), including mortgage loans,
home equity loans and lines of credit, reverse mortgage loans, auto loans, credit cards, deposit accounts, personal loans, student loans,
small business loans and other related offerings. In addition, we offer tools and resources, including free credit scores, that facilitate
comparison shopping for these loans, deposits and other credit-based offerings. We seek to match consumers with multiple lenders, who
can provide them with competing quotes for the product they are seeking. By providing consumers access to a broad array of credit-based
offerings directly from multiple lenders, rather than just multiple quotes from the same lender or indirectly through intermediaries,
we believe our marketplace is differentiated from other providers operating loan comparison-shopping marketplaces. 

Our
strategically designed and executed advertising and marketing campaigns (which we refer to as performance marketing) span a wide array
of digital and traditional media acquisition channels and promote our BorrowMoney.com and other brands and product offerings. Our marketing
efforts are designed to attract consumers to our websites and toll-free telephone numbers. Interested consumers complete inquiry forms,
providing detailed information about themselves and the loans or other offerings they are seeking. We refer to such consumer inquiries
as loan requests. We then match these loan requests with lenders in our marketplace that are seeking to serve these consumers 
needs. We plan to generate revenue from these lenders, generally at the time of transmitting a loan request to them, in the form of a
match fee. In certain instances, outside our mortgage business, we plan to charge other kinds of fees, such as closed loan or closed
sale fees. In addition to our primary loan request data referral business, BorrowMoney also matches consumers with lenders via website
clicks and calls for which we anticipate lenders paying either front-end or back-end fees. 

We
are continually working to improve the consumer experience. We have made investments in technologically-adept personnel and we use in-market
real-time testing to improve our digital platforms. Additionally, we work with our lenders, including providing training and other resources,
to improve the consumer experience throughout the loan process. Further, we have been building and improving our My BorrowMoney platform,
which provides a relationship-based consumer experience, rather than just a transaction-based experience. 

We
have generated 3,000 revenues for the year ending August 31, 2021 and 2,148 for the year 2020 

Evolution
and Future Growth of Our Business 

We
have actively sought to expand the suite of loan and other product offerings we provide to consumers, in order to both leverage the applicability
of the BorrowMoney.com brand as well as more fully serve the needs of consumers and lenders. We believe that consumers with existing
BorrowMoney-branded associations will be more likely to utilize our other service offerings than those of other providers whose brands
consumers may not recognize. 

In
October 2021, we completed our backend and software development and intend to launch My BorrowMoney.com, a platform that offers a personalized
loan comparison-shopping experience, by providing free credit scores and credit score analysis. This platform enables us to observe consumers 
credit profiles and then identify and alert them to loan and other credit-based offerings in our marketplace that may be more favorable
than the loans they have at a given point in time. This is designed to provide consumers with measurable savings opportunities over their
lifetimes. 

By
expanding our portfolio of loans and other product offerings, we are growing and diversifying our business and sources of revenue. We
intend to capitalize on our expertise in performance marketing, product development and technology and to leverage the widespread recognition
of the BorrowMoney.com brand, in order to generate leads. 

2 

We
believe the consumer and small business financial services industry has undergone a fundamental shift to online product offerings, similar
to the shift that started in retail and travel many years ago and is now well established. We believe that, like retail and travel, as
consumers continue to move towards online shopping and transactions for financial services, suppliers will increasingly shift their product
offerings and advertising budgets toward the online channel. We believe the strength of our brands and of our lender network place us
in a strong position to continue to benefit from this market shift. 

Products 

We
currently report our revenues in two product categories: (i) mortgage products and (ii) non-mortgage products. Non-mortgage products
include credit cards, personal loans, home equity loans, reverse mortgage loans, auto loans, small business loans and student loans.
Non-mortgage products also include deposit accounts, home improvement referrals and other credit products such as credit repair and debt
settlement. 

BorrowMoney.com
does not charge individual consumers for the use of our services. Commercial loans may have certain service fees attached to their loans.
Revenues from our mortgage products plan to be derived from lead generation fees paid by the Network Lenders that receive a loan request,
and in some cases upfront fees for clicks or call transfers. Because a given loan request form can be matched with more than one Network
Lender, up to five match fees may be generated from a single consumer loan request form. Revenues from our non-mortgage products plan
to be derived from upfront match fees paid on delivery of a loan request, click or call and closed loan fees. For our products, we send
click traffic to issuers and anticipate being paid per approval. 

Mortgage
Products 

Our
mortgage inquiry products category includes our purchase and refinance products. 

We
partner with lenders throughout the United States to provide full geographic lending coverage and to offer a complete suite of loan offerings
on our marketplace. To participate on our marketplace, lenders are required to enter into contracts with us that state the terms and
conditions for such participation, although these contracts generally may be terminated for convenience by either party. We perform certain
due diligence procedures on prospective new lenders, including screening against a national anti-fraud database maintained by the Mortgage
Asset Research Institute, which helps manage our risk exposure. The data is utilized to determine whether a lender and its principals
are eligible to participate on our marketplace and have not been convicted of and/or penalized for fraudulent activity. 

Consumers
seeking mortgage loans through our loan marketplace can receive multiple conditional loan offers from participating lenders in response
to a single loan request form. We refer to the process by which we match consumers and Network Lenders as the matching process. This
matching process consists of the following steps: 

1) 
 Loan
 Request. Consumers complete a single loan request form with information regarding the type of mortgage loan product they are
 seeking, loan preferences and other data. Consumers also consent to a soft inquiry regarding their credit. 

2) 
 Loan
 Request Form Matching and Transmission. Our proprietary systems and technology match a given consumer s loan request form
 data, credit profile and geographic location against certain pre-established criteria of Network Lenders, which may be modified from
 time to time. Once a given loan request passes through the matching process, the loan request is automatically transmitted to up
 to five participating Network Lenders. 

3) 
 Lender
 Evaluation and Response. Network Lenders that receive a loan request form evaluate the information contained in it to determine
 whether to make a conditional loan offer. 

4) 
 Communication
 of a Conditional Offer. All matched Network Lenders and any conditional offers are presented to the consumer upon completion
 of the loan request form. Consumers can return to the site and view their offer(s) at any time by logging in to their My BorrowMoney.com
 profile. Additionally, matched lenders and offers are also sent to the email address associated with the consumer request. 

3 

We
also offer consumers other mortgage marketplace products such as: 

- 
 an
 alternative short-form matching process, which provides them with lender contact information rather than conditional
 offers from Network Lenders, and 

- 
 a
 rate table loan marketplace, where consumers can enter their loan and credit profile and dynamically view real-time
 rates from lenders without entering their contact information. 

Non-Mortgage
Products 

Lending
Products . Other lending products on our online marketplace include information, tools and access to multiple conditional loan offers
for the following: 

- 
 Auto ,
 which includes our auto refinance and purchase loan products. Auto loans enable consumers to purchase new or used vehicles or refinance
 an existing loan secured by an automobile. 

- 
 Home
 equity loans and lines of credit , which enable homeowners to borrow against the equity in their home, as measured by the difference
 between the market value of the home and any existing loans secured by the home. Home equity loans are one-time lump sum loans, whereas
 a home equity line of credit reflects a line of revolving credit where the borrower has flexibility to draw down and repay the line. 

- 
 Personal
 loans , which are unsecured obligations generally carrying shorter terms and smaller loan amounts than home mortgages. 

- 
 Reverse
 mortgage loans , which are a loan product available to qualifying homeowners age 62 or older. 

- 
 Small
 business loans , which include a broad array of financing types, including but not limited to loans secured by working capital,
 equipment, real estate and other forms of financing, provided to small and medium-sized businesses. 

- 
 Student
 loans , which includes both new loans to finance an education and related expenses, as well as refinancing of existing loans. 

We
intend to continue adding new lending offerings for consumers, small businesses and lenders on our online marketplace, in order to grow
and diversify our sources of revenue. We may develop such new offerings through internal product development efforts, strategic business
relationships with third parties and/or acquisitions. 

Other
Products . Other products also include information, tools and access to the following: 

- 
 Small
 business loans, which include a broad array of financing types, including but not limited to loans secured by working capital, equipment,
 real estate and other forms of financing, provided to small and medium-sized businesses. 

- 
 Student
 loans, which include both new loans to finance education and related expenses, as well as refinancing of existing loans. 

- 
 Deposit
 accounts, through which consumers can access depository deals and analysis covering all major deposit product categories. 

- 
 Credit
 repair, through which consumers can obtain assistance improving their credit profiles, in order to expand and improve loan and other
 financial product opportunities available to them. 

- 
 Debt
 relief services, through which consumers can obtain assistance negotiating existing loans. 

- 
 Home
 improvement services, through which consumers have the opportunity to research and find home improvement professional services. 

- 
 Personal
 credit data, through which consumers can gain insights into how prospective lenders and other third parties view their credit profiles. 

- 
 Real
 estate brokerage services, through which consumers are matched with local realtors who can assist them in their home purchase or
 sale efforts. 

- 
 Various
 consumer insurance products, including home and automobile, through which consumers are matched with insurance lead aggregators to
 obtain insurance offers. 

4 

We
refer to the various purchasers of leads from our other marketplaces as lead purchasers. We plan to generate revenue from the deposit
account product from a consumer clicking from our website through to a financial institution s website. We plan to generate revenue
through the insurance products and real estate brokerage services through match fees paid to us by insurance lead aggregators and real
estate brokers participating in our online marketplace. We plan to generate revenue from credit repair and debt relief services either
through a fee for a customer referral to a service provider partner or through a fee at the time a consumer enrolls in a program with
one of our partners. Revenue for home services is planned to be derived primarily through matching of leads to other home services lead
aggregators. 

Seasonality 

We
anticipate revenue in our lending business to be subject to cyclical and seasonal trends. Home sales (and purchase mortgages) typically
rise during the spring and summer months and decline during the fall and winter months, while refinancing and home equity activity is
principally driven by mortgage interest rates as well as real estate values. However, in certain historical periods, additional factors
affecting the mortgage and real estate markets, such as the 2008-2009 financial crisis and ensuing recession, have impacted customary
seasonal trends. 

We
anticipate revenue in our newer products will be cyclical as well; however, we have limited historical data to predict the nature and
magnitude of this cyclicality. Based on industry data, we anticipate that as our personal loan product matures, we will experience less
consumer demand during the fourth and first quarters of each year. We anticipate higher consumer demand for deposit accounts in the first
quarter of each year. The majority of consumer demand for student loan products occurs in the third quarter coinciding with collegiate
enrollment in late summer. Other factors affecting our businesses include macro factors such as credit availability in the market, interest
rates, the strength of the economy and employment. 

Competition 

We
compete with other online marketing companies, including online intermediaries that operate network-type arrangements. We also face competition
from lenders that source consumer loan originations directly. These companies typically operate consumer-branded websites and attract
consumers via online banner ads, keyword placement on search engines, direct mail, television ads, retail branches, realtors, brokers,
radio and other sources, partnerships with affiliates and business development arrangements with others, including major online portals. 

Product
Development 

We
invest in the continued development of both new and existing products to enhance the experiences of consumers and lenders as they interact
with us. 

Corporate
History 

BorrowMoney.com,
Inc. was incorporated in the state of New York on January 27, 2000. The company was reincorporated in Florida on May 4, 2015. The Company
completed a share exchange with all of the stockholders of BorrowMoney.com, Inc., a New York corporation whereby 100 of the issued and
outstanding shares of the New York corporation were exchanged for 20 million shares of the Florida corporation, which resulted in BorrowMoney.com,
Inc. The New York corporation becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of the Florida corporation. Unless the context otherwise requires, all
references to the Company , we , our BorrowMoney or
 us and other similar terms collectively means BorrowMoney.com, Inc., the Florida corporation.

Regulation
and Legal Compliance 

The
goal of our businesses is to market and provide services in heavily regulated industries through a number of different online and offline
channels across the United States. As a result, we are subject to a variety of statutes, rules, regulations, policies and procedures
in various jurisdictions in the United States, including: 

- 
 Restrictions
 on the manner in which consumer loans are marketed and originated, including, but not limited to, the making of required consumer
 disclosures, such as the Federal Trade Commission s Mortgage Advertising Practices MAP Rules, federal Truth-in-Lending
 Act, the federal Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the federal Fair Credit Reporting Act, the federal Fair Housing Act, the federal Real
 Estate Settlement Procedures Act RESPA ), and similar state laws; 

- 
 Restrictions
 imposed by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Dodd Frank Act and current or future
 rules promulgated thereunder, including, but not limited to, limitations on fees charged by mortgage lenders, mortgage broker disclosures
 and rules promulgated by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau CFPB ), which was created under the Dodd-Frank Act; 

- 
 Restrictions
 on the amount and nature of fees that may be charged to lenders and real estate professionals for providing or obtaining consumer
 loan requests, such as under RESPA; 

- 
 Federal

 Act that require us to be licensed in all States and the District of Columbia (licensing requirements are applicable to both
 individuals and/or businesses engaged in the solicitation of or the brokering of residential mortgage loans and/or the brokering
 of real estate transactions); 

- 
 State
 and federal restrictions on the marketing activities conducted by telephone, mail, email, mobile device or the internet, including
 the Telemarketing Sales Rule TSR ), the Telephone Consumer Protection Act TCPA ), state telemarketing
 laws, federal and state privacy laws, the CAN-SPAM Act, and the Federal Trade Commission Act and their accompanying regulations and
 guidelines; 

- 
 State
 laws requiring licensure for or otherwise imposing restrictions on the solicitation of or brokering of consumer loans which could
 affect us in our personal loan, automobile loan, student loan, credit card, or other non-mortgage consumer lending businesses; 

- 
 Restrictions
 on the usage and storage of consumer credit information, such as those contained in the federal Fair Credit Reporting Act and the
 federal Credit Repair Organization Act; and 

- 
 State
 Bird Dog laws which restrict the amount and nature of fees, if any, that may be charged to consumers for automobile
 direct and indirect financing. 

Intellectual
Property 

We
believe that our intellectual property rights are vital to our success. To protect our intellectual property rights in our brand, technology,
products, improvements, and inventions, we rely on a combination of trademarks, trade secrets, patents and other laws, and contractual
restrictions on disclosure, including confidentiality agreements with strategic partners, employees, consultants and other third parties.
As new or improved proprietary technologies are developed or inventions are identified, we plan to seek patent protection in the United
States and abroad, as appropriate. 

Many
of our services are offered under proprietary trademarks and service marks. We generally apply to register or secure by contract our
principal trademarks and service marks as they are developed and used. 

We
reserve and register domain names when and where we deem appropriate, and we currently have over 30 registered domain names. We also
have agreements with third parties that provide for the licensing of patented and proprietary technology used in our business. 

From
time to time, we may be subjected to legal proceedings and claims, or threatened legal proceedings or claims, including allegations of
infringement of third-party trademarks, copyrights, patents and other intellectual property

We

From
time to time, we may be subjected to legal proceedings and claims, or threatened legal proceedings or claims, including allegations of
infringement of third-party trademarks, copyrights, patents and other intellectual property rights of third parties. In addition, the
use of litigation and other dispute resolution processes, such as Uniform Domain Name Dispute Resolution, may be necessary for us to
enforce our intellectual property rights, protect trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of proprietary rights claimed
by others. Any litigation of this nature, regardless of outcome or merit, could result in substantial costs and diversion of management
and technical resources, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 

Employees 

We
have outsourced our human resources and will continue to utilize a third-party provider in order to minimize any liability associated
with payroll and employee regulatory issues.

Dividends 

We
have never paid any cash dividends on our common stock. We currently anticipate that we will retain all future earnings for use in our
business. Consequently, we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. The payment of dividends in the future
will depend upon our results of operations, as well as our short-term and long-term cash availability, working capital, working capital
needs, and other factors as determined by our Board of Directors. Currently, except as may be provided by applicable laws, there are
no contractual or other restrictions on our ability to pay dividends if we were to decide to declare and pay them. 

Holders
of Our Common Stock 

As
of the date of this Annual Report, we had 46 stockholders of our common stock, not including any persons who hold their stock in street
name .

Penny
Stock 

The
SEC has adopted rules that regulate broker-dealer practices in connection with transactions in penny stocks. Penny stocks are generally
equity securities with a market price of less than 5.00, other than securities registered on certain national securities exchanges or
quoted on the NASDAQ system, provided that current price and volume information with respect to transactions in such securities is provided
by the exchange or system. The penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, prior to a transaction in a penny stock, to deliver a standardized
risk disclosure document prepared by the SEC, that: (a) contains a description of the nature and level of risk in the market for penny
stocks in both public offerings and secondary trading; (b) contains a description of the broker s or dealer s duties to the
customer and of the rights and remedies available to the customer with respect to a violation of such duties or other requirements of
the securities laws; (c) contains a brief, clear, narrative description of a dealer market, including bid and ask prices for penny stocks
and the significance of the spread between the bid and ask price; (d) contains a toll-free telephone number for inquiries on disciplinary
actions; (e) defines significant terms in the disclosure document or in the conduct of trading in penny stocks; and (f) contains such
other information and is in such form, including language, type size and format, as the SEC shall require by rule or regulation. 

The
broker-dealer also must provide, prior to effecting any transaction in a penny stock, the customer with (a) bid and offer quotations
for the penny stock; (b) the compensation of the broker-dealer and its salesperson in the transaction; (c) the number of shares to which
such bid and ask prices apply, or other comparable information relating to the depth and liquidity of the market for such stock; and
(d) a monthly account statement showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer s account. 

In
addition, the penny stock rules require that prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from those rules, the broker-dealer
must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser s
written acknowledgment of the receipt of a risk disclosure statement, a written agreement as to transactions involving penny stocks,
and a signed and dated copy of a written suitability statement. 

These
disclosure requirements may have the effect of reducing the trading activity for our common stock should our stock ever be traded on
a public market. Therefore, stockholders may have difficulty selling our securities.

 accredited investors and/or had access to similar information as would be included in a Registration Statement under
the Securities Act. The securities were offered without any general solicitation by us or our representatives. No underwriters or
agents were involved in the foregoing issuances and we paid no underwriting discounts or commissions. The securities are subject to
transfer restrictions, and the certificates evidencing the securities contain an appropriate legend stating that such securities
have not been registered under the Securities Act and may not be offered or sold absent registration or pursuant to an exemption
therefrom. The securities were not registered under the Securities Act and such securities may not be offered or sold in the
United States absent registration or an exemption from registration under the Securities Act and any applicable state securities
laws.

events and are subject to uncertainty as to possible changes in economic, legislative, industry and other circumstances. As a result,
the identification and interpretation of data and other information and their use in developing and selecting assumptions from and among

Overview 

BorrowMoney.com,
Inc. operates what we believe to be the leading online loan marketplace for consumers seeking loans and other credit-based offerings.
The Company offers borrowers screened lenders and takes steps to ensure the lender s trustworthiness and legitimacy.
The Company provides institutional lenders with innovative digital solutions by offering fintech technologically advanced gathered leads
through an exclusive proprietary platform. Our online marketplace provides consumers with access to product offerings from our Network
Lenders, including mortgage loans, home equity loans and lines of credit, reverse mortgage loans, auto loans, credit cards, deposit accounts,
personal loans, student loans, small business loans and other related offerings. In addition, we offer tools and resources, including
free credit scores that facilitate comparison shopping for these loans, deposits and other credit-based offerings. We seek to match consumers
with multiple lenders, who can provide them with competing quotes for the product they are seeking. 

10 

We
also serve as a valued partner to lenders seeking an efficient, scalable and flexible source of customer acquisition with directly measurable
benefits, by matching the consumer inquiries we generate with these lenders. 

Our
BorrowMoney.com platform offers a personalized loan comparison-shopping experience by providing free credit scores and credit score analysis.
This platform enables us to observe consumers credit profiles and then identify and alert them to loan and other credit-based
opportunities on our marketplace that may be more favorable than the loans they may have at a given point in time. This is designed to
provide consumers with measurable savings opportunities over their lifetimes. 

In
addition to operating our core mortgage inquiry and leads business, we are focused on growing our non-mortgage lending businesses and
developing new product offerings and enhancements to improve the experiences that consumers and lenders have as they interact with us.
By expanding our portfolio of loans and other product offerings, we are growing and diversifying our business and sources of revenue.
We intend to capitalize on our expertise in performance marketing, product development and technology, and to leverage the widespread
recognition of the BorrowMoney.com brand to affect this strategy. 

We
believe the consumer and small business financial services industry is in the early stages of a fundamental shift to online product offerings,
similar to the shift that started in retail and travel many years ago and is now well established. We believe that like retail and travel,
as consumers continue to move towards online shopping and transactions for financial services, suppliers will increasingly shift their
product offerings and advertising budgets toward the online channel. We believe the strength of our brands and of our lender network,
place us in a strong position to continue to benefit from this market shift. 

BorrowMoney.com,
Inc. s main objective is to provide lead generation services to the mortgage and loan lenders. BorrowMoney.com, Inc. s business
model envisions providing current, qualified leads to local lending institutions nationwide. These leads will represent qualified borrowers
in targeted zip code locations where the lender conducts business. Our internet platform offers a portal geared toward providing services
to lending institutions who would be our customers. The key function of our platform is to provide qualified leads to local mortgage
and lending professionals. The Company generates customer inquiries using various marketing methods. The Company also sells advertising
space on its website and creates revenue through the sale of advertisement space, membership fees and lead packages. 

We
are an emerging growth company, as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business
Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act. As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements
that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, not
being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from
the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments
not previously approved. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market
for our securities and the prices of our securities may be more volatile. 

In
addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended
transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other
words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise
apply to private companies. We intend to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period until we are no longer an
 emerging growth company. 

We
will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) in which we have total annual gross
revenue of at least 1.07 billion, or (b) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our
common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds 700 million as (2) the date on which we have issued more than 1.0 billion in non-convertible
debt during the prior three-year period.

Limited
Operating History 

We
have not previously demonstrated that we will be able to expand our business through an increased investment in our product lines and/or
marketing efforts. We cannot guarantee that the expansion efforts described in this report will be successful. Our business is subject
to risks inherent in growing an enterprise, including limited capital resources and possible rejection of our products and/or sales methods. 

Plan
of Operations 

We
have completed our technology platform. We are now entering our operational phase which includes contracting business loan, mortgage
and personal loan lenders for geographic areas using ZIP Codes. In addition to expanding our network of lenders over the next 12 months,
we intend to continue optimizing and enhancing our Internet-based platform to focus on lead generation and generating additional revenues
for our marketplace services. Our mission is to be the premier loan lead generation company. The budget for the next 12 months is estimated
to be 500,000, which is expected to come from friends, family, and officers. A breakdown of the estimated cost for our next 12 months
of operation are as follows: 

(000 s)

Revenues
are expected to be minimal as the volume of lender agreements during this stage of operation is expected to increase at a gradual pace
throughout the year. We expect to operate at a loss during our initial growth/operating period. President, Directors, or other executive
officers will be compensated with sweat equity options until such time that the company has positive cash flows. 

Contingent
upon the successful completion of our next 12 months of operation, we plan to aggressively expand our operation and business from existing
revenues. Our expansion would be accompanied by an increase in the number of personnel to obtain lender agreements for ever-expanding
geographic areas.

Channels
of Distribution; Marketing Costs 

BorrowMoney.com
markets and offers services directly to customers through its branded website allowing customers to be pre-qualified in a one stop platform
and have access to all the major lenders and loan programs. The Company has made, and expects to continue to make, substantial investments
in its online technology platform and marketing strategy to build its brand awareness in the marketplace that will drive traffic and
generate leads. The need for online mortgages and personal money loan platform is driven not only by the millennium generation that are
moving away from traditional brick and mortar banks but also from the new lifestyle changes caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. BorrowMoney.com
expects to take advantage of this opportunity to capture a large portion of this new marketplace demand and increase its
revenue exponentially.

As
of August 31, 2021, the Company s cash balance was 9.3k compared to 7.8k as of August 31, 2020, and our total assets as of August
31, 2021, was 9.3k. 

As
of August 31, 2021, the Company had total liabilities of 635.3k compared with total liabilities of 598.0 as of August 31, 2020. The
increase in total liabilities for the year ended August 31, 2021, was primarily the result of an increase in accrued interest and notes,
an increase in legal expense accrual and due to related party, as well as an advance on a line of credit. 

We
had 144.2k of cash used in operating activities for the year ended August 31, 2021, compared to 90.0k of cash used in operating activities
for the year ended August 31, 2020. 

We
had 145.7k of cash provided by financing activities for the year ended August 31, 2021, compared to 90.2k of cash provided by financing
activities for the year ended August 31, 2020. Cash provided by financing activities was primarily proceeds from stock sale and related
party loans. 

Financial
Position, Liquidity and Capital Resource 

As
of August 31, 2021, all cash loaned by the Company to pay its operating and development expenses has been furnished by loans from its
founder and President, Aldo Piscitello, as well as from the sale of equity and advances by related parties and advances from a line of
credit. Additionally, the Company anticipates selling shares of the Company through a private offering of its securities to supplement
its capital requirements in the future, as funding is needed. 

Interest
expense of 42.9k and 37.2k for the years ended August 31, 2021, and 2020, respectively, was the result of accruals related to shareholder
and related party. 

Plan
of Operation and Funding 

During
the next twelve months, we anticipate that our principal sources of funding will comprise of proceeds from sales of our common stock,
revenue generated from our operations, and additional debt, if needed.

Critical
Accounting Policies 

Our
critical accounting policies, including the assumptions and judgments underlying them, are disclosed in the Notes to the Consolidated
Financial Statements. We have consistently applied these policies in all material respects. We do not believe that our operations to
date have involved uncertainty of accounting treatment, subjective judgment, or estimates, to any significant degree. 

Going
Concern 

Because
we have suffered recurring losses from operations and negative operating cash flows, there is substantial doubt about the Company s
ability to continue as a going concern. The ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on Management s plans, which include
potential asset acquisitions, mergers or business combinations with other entities, further implementation of its business plan and continuing
to raise funds through debt or equity raises. The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern
basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. 

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements 

We
have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition,
changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that
is material to stockholders. 

Item
7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 

As
a smaller reporting company, as defined by Rule 229.10(f) (1) of Regulation S-K, we are not required to provide the information required
by this Item. We have chosen to disclose, however, that we have not engaged in any transactions, issued or bought any financial instruments
or entered into any contracts that are required to be disclosed in response to this item.

Item
8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data 

REPORT
OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

To
the Board of Directors and 

 Stockholders
of Borrowmoney.com, Inc. 

Opinion
on the Financial Statements 

We
have audited the accompanying balance sheet of Borrowmoney.com, Inc (the Company) as of August 31,2021 and 2020, and the related statements
of operations, stockholders deficit, and cash flows for the years then ended, and the related notes and schedules (collectively
referred to as the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of the Company as of August 31, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flow for the years ended August
31, 2021 and 2020, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 

Basis
for Opinion 

These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s
financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities
laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud.
The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As
part of our audit, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose
of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we
express no such opinion. 

Our
audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether
due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis,
evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the
consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

Critical
Audit Matters 

The
critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were
communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material
to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of
critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by
communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or
disclosures to which they relate. 

15 

Related
Party Transactions 

We
identified related party transactions as a critical audit matter due to the fact these types of transactions account for the majority
of the balance sheet. The principal considerations for our determination of this critical audit matter relates to the high degree of
risk that related parties go unidentified, unrecorded, and disclosed. These types of transactions can have significant impact on debt,
receivables, equity, expenses, and disclosures of the company. 

The
primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included the following: 

Inquired
 of management as to the identification of related parties and related party transactions. 

Reviewed
 the entire general ledger for potential unrecorded or unidentified related party transactions in consideration of our knowledge of
 related parties. 

Obtained
 agreements between the Company and related parties and reviewed for proper accounting and disclosures. 

Obtained
 confirmations of balances and transactions as of and for the year ended. 

Equity
Transactions 

We
identified equity transactions as a critical audit matter due to the fact the Company had a stock split and change in par value. The
principal considerations for our determination of this critical audit matter relates to the high degree of risk that the equity transactions
will not reflect the changes resulting from the stock split and change in par value. These types of transactions can have significant
impact on classification of equity accounts, expenses, and disclosures of the company. 

The
primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included the following: 

Reviewed
 the entire general ledger for transactions that could potentially have an impact on equity. 

Obtained
 and reviewed equity agreements. 

Inquired
 of management as to the existence and completeness of equity transactions. 

Obtained
 a stock transfer report as of year-end and agreed with activity reported in the books of the 
 Company. 

Obtained
 an equity rollforward; recalculated common stock, additional paid in capital, and retained earnings. 

Substantial
Doubt about the Company s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern 

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note
2, the Company has suffered recurring losses from operations and has a net capital deficiency that raises substantial doubt about its
ability to continue as a going concern. Management s plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 2. Our opinion
is not modified with respect to that matter. 

We
have served as the Company s auditor since 2021.

 Notes
to the Financial Statements 

 For
the Years Ended August 31, 2021, and 2020 

in revenue for the year ended August 31, 2021 and for the year ended August 31, 2020. 

The
Company is commencing operations to generate sufficient revenue; however, the Company s cash position may not be sufficient to
support the Company s daily operations. Management intends to raise additional funds by way of a private or public offering. While
the Company believes in the viability of its strategy to commence operations and generate sufficient revenue and in its ability to raise
additional funds, there can be no assurances to that effect. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon
the Company s ability to further implement its business plan and generate sufficient revenue and its ability to raise additional
funds by way of private offerings. The financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability and classification
of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue
as a going concern. 

cash equivalents on August 31, 2021 and
2020. 

awards were granted. 

When
tax returns are filed, it is highly certain that some positions taken would be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities,
while others are subject to uncertainty about the merits of the position taken or the amount of the position that would be ultimately
sustained. The benefit of a tax position is recognized in the financial statements in the period during which, based on all available
evidence, management believes it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including the resolution
of appeals or litigation processes, if any. Tax positions taken are not offset or aggregated with other positions. Tax positions that
meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold are measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is 
of being realized upon settlement with the applicable taxing authority. The portion of the benefits associated with tax positions taken
that exceeds the amount measured as described above is reflected as a liability for unrecognized tax benefits along with any associated
interest and penalties that would be payable to the taxing authorities upon examination. As of August 31, 2021 the Company had no unrecognized
tax benefits, and the Company had no positions which, in the opinion of management, would be reversed if challenged by a taxing authority. 

The
Company s evaluation of tax positions was performed for those tax years which remain open to audit. The Company may, from time

as of August 31, 2021, in available net operating loss (NOL) carryovers available to reduce future
income taxes. The Company has adopted ASC 740 which provides for the
recognition of a deferred tax asset based upon the value the loss carry-forwards will have to reduce future income taxes and management s
estimate of the probability of the realization of these tax benefits. We have determined it more likely than not that these timing differences
will not materialize and have provided a valuation allowance against our entire net deferred tax asset of approximately . 

Future
utilization of currently generated federal and state NOL and tax credit carry forwards may be subject to a substantial annual limitation
due to the ownership change limitations provided by the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended and similar state provisions. The annual
limitation may result in the expiration of NOL and tax credit carryforwards before full utilization. 

The
Company determines whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination based upon the technical
merits of the position. If the more likely than not threshold is met, the Company measures the tax position to determine the amount to
recognize in the financial statements. The Company performed a review of its material tax positions in accordance with these recognition
and measurement standards. The Company has concluded that there are no significant uncertain tax positions requiring disclosure and there
are not material amounts of unrecognized tax benefits. 

, effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, the transition
of U.S. international taxation from a worldwide tax system to a territorial system, and a one-time transition tax on the mandatory deemed
repatriation of cumulative foreign earnings as of December 31, 2017. We use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes.
Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between
the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. Deferred tax assets and liabilities
are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected
to reverse. As a result of the reduction in the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35 to 21 under the Tax Act, we revalued our ending
net deferred tax assets at August 31, 2018, which were fully offset by a valuation allowance. 

Deferred
tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between financial statement and tax bases using enacted tax rates in
effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The components of the current and deferred provision at August
31, 2021 and 2020 were as follows:

Total Deferred: 

Allowance

 - 
 - 

Less valuation allowance 

Net deferred 
 - 
 - 

For
the fiscal years ended August 31, 2021 and 2020, the valuation allowance increased primarily as a result of the increase in net operating
losses. In assessing the realizability of deferred income tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some
portion or all of the deferred income tax assets will not be realized. 

NOL
Carryforwards and Other Matters 

The
Company files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and the state of Florida. The Company s federal and state tax
years for the 2019 fiscal year and forward are subject to examination by taxing authorities. 

The
Company did not have any unrecognized tax benefits as of August 31, 2021, and 2020. The Company s policy is to account for any
interest expense and penalties for unrecognized tax benefits as part of the income tax provision. The Company does not anticipate that
unrecognized tax benefits will significantly increase or decrease within the next twelve months.

9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure 

On
February 2, 2021, the Company, with the recommendation and approval of the Board of Directors of the Company, engaged ACCELL AUDIT 
COMPLIANCE, P.A. as its independent registered public accounting firm. 

Item
9A. Controls and Procedures 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedure. 

Disclosure
controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) are designed to ensure that information
required to be disclosed in reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within
the time periods specified in Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated
to management, including the Company s Principal Executive Officer/Principal Financial Officer (our principal executive officer
and principal financial officer), to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. As of the end of the period covered by this
report, the Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of Aldo Piscitello, who is the Company s
Principal Executive Officer/Principal Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s disclosure
controls and procedures. The Company s Principal Executive Officer/Principal Financial Officer has concluded that the Company s
disclosure controls and procedures are, in fact, not effective, as the Company still lacks segregation of duties as of the period covered. 

We
do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all errors and all instances of fraud. Disclosure controls and
procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the
disclosure controls and procedures are met. Further, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there
are resource constraints, and the benefits must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all disclosure
controls and procedures, no evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures can provide absolute assurance that we have detected all
our control deficiencies and instances of fraud, if any. The design of disclosure controls and procedures also is based partly on certain
assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated
goals under all potential future conditions. 

Management s
Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over
financial reporting is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as a process designed
by, or under the supervision of, our principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by our Board, management and other
personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements
for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that: 

pertain
 to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; 

provide
 reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with
 U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance
 with authorizations of our management and directors; and 

provide
 reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company s
 assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 

28 

Management
assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of August 31, 2021. In making this assessment, management
used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in the 2013 Internal Control-Integrated
Framework . Based on this assessment, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as
of August 31, 2021, due to the existence of the material weaknesses as of August 31, 2021, discussed below. A material weakness is a
control deficiency, or a combination of control deficiencies, that results in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement
of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected in the following areas: 

Because
 of the Company s limited resources, there are limited controls over information processing. 

There
 is an inadequate segregation of duties consistent with control objectives. Our company s management is composed of only one
 person, resulting in a situation where limitations on segregation of duties exist. In order to remedy this situation, we would need
 to hire additional staff to provide greater segregation of duties. Currently, it is not feasible to hire additional staff to obtain
 optimal segregation of duties. Management will reassess this matter in the following year to determine whether improvement in segregation
 of duties is feasible. 

Our
 Company does not have a formal audit committee with a financial expert, and thus our company lacks the board oversight role within
 the financial reporting process. 

There
 is a lack of formal policies and procedures necessary to adequately review significant accounting transactions. Our company utilizes
 a third-party independent contractor for the preparation of its financial statements. Although the financial statements and footnotes
 are reviewed by our management, we do not have a formal policy to review significant accounting transactions and the accounting treatment
 of such transactions. The third-party independent contractor is not involved in the day-to-day operations of our company and may
 not be provided information from management on a timely basis to allow for adequate reporting/consideration of certain transactions. 

Management
believes that the material weaknesses set forth above were the result of the scale of our operations and are intrinsic to our small size.
Management believes these weaknesses did not have a material effect on our financial results and intends to take remedial actions upon
receiving funding for our company s business operations. 

Our
management will continue to monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of our internal controls and procedures and our internal controls
over financial reporting on an ongoing basis and is committed to taking further action and implementing additional enhancements or improvements,
as necessary and as funds allow. 

This
Annual Report on Form 10-K does not include an attestation report of our company s registered public accounting firm regarding
internal control over financial reporting due to permanent exemptions for smaller reporting companies. 

Changes
in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting 

There
were no changes to the Company s internal controls over financial reporting, during the quarter ended August 31, 2021, that have
been materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially effect, the Company s internal controls over financial reporting.

Review,
Approval and Ratification of Related Party Transactions 

Given
our small size and limited financial resources, we have not adopted formal policies and procedures for the review, approval or ratification
of transactions, such as those described above, with our executive officers, directors and significant stockholders. However, all of
the transactions described above were approved and ratified by our Board of Directors. In connection with the approval of the transactions
described above, our Board of Directors took into account various factors, including their fiduciary duty to the Company; the relationships
of the related parties described above to the Company; the material facts underlying each transaction; the anticipated benefits to the
Company and related costs associated with such benefits; whether comparable products or services were available; and the terms the Company
could receive from an unrelated third party. 

We
intend to establish formal policies and procedures in the future, once we have sufficient resources and have appointed additional directors.
On a moving forward basis, our Board of Directors will continue to approve any related party transaction based on the criteria set forth
above.

Exhibit 14.1 

BORROWMONEY.COM, INC. 

 CODE OF BUSINESS CONDUCT AND ETHICS 

September 2021 

Introduction and Scope 

The Board of Directors of BorrowMoney.com,
Inc. (together with any subsidiaries, the Company established this Code of Business Conduct and Ethics (this Code to aid the Company s directors, officers, employees and consultants in conducting the Company s business affairs in accordance
with standards of ethical conduct that will maintain and foster the Company s reputation for honest and straightforward business
dealings. 

The Company s Board of Directors
or any committee designated by the Board of Directors is responsible for administering this Code. The Board of Directors has delegated
day-to-day responsibility for administering and interpreting this code to a Compliance Officer. The Company s General Counsel has
been appointed as the Compliance Officer under this Code. 

Every director, officer, employee
and consultant of the Company (each a Covered Person, and collectively the Covered Persons is subject to
and must abide by this Code. Covered Persons are expected to exercise reasonable judgment when conducting the Company s business. 

Nothing in this Code alters the
at-will status of any employee or consultant of the Company. 

Honest, Lawful and Ethical Conduct 

The conduct of Covered Persons
in performing their duties on behalf of the Company should in all situations, as to all matters and at all times, be honest, lawful and
in accordance with high ethical and professional standards. In addition, the conduct of Covered Persons should at all times be respectful
of the rights of others and in the best interests of the Company. 

The requirements of honest, lawful
and ethical conduct are broad and stated in general terms. As such, this Code does not cover every issue that may arise, but instead sets
out basic principles. The Company encourages Covered Persons to refer to this Code frequently to ensure that they are acting within both
the letter and the spirit of this Code. The Company understands that this Code will not contain the answer to every situation that a Covered
Person may encounter or every concern you may have about conducting the Company s business ethically and legally. In these situations,
or if a Covered Person has other questions or concerns about this Code, the Company encourages such Covered Person to speak with his or
her immediate supervisor (if applicable) or, if he or she is uncomfortable doing so, with the Compliance Officer under this Code. Covered
Persons may also utilize the procedures established from time to time by the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors (the Audit
Committee for the receipt, retention and treatment of complaints received by the Company regarding accounting, internal accounting
controls or auditing matters. Such procedures are currently set forth below in this Code. 

Contents of this Code 

This Code has two sections which
follow this Introduction. The first section, Standards of Conduct , contains the actual guidelines that Covered
Persons are expected to adhere to in the conduct of the Company s business. The second section, Compliance Procedures , 
contains specific information about how this Code functions, including who administers the Code, who can provide guidance under the Code
and how violations may be reported, investigated and resolved. This section also contains a discussion about waivers of and amendments
to this Code. 

A Note About Other Obligations 

Covered Persons generally have
other legal and contractual obligations to the Company. This Code is not intended to reduce or limit such obligations. Instead, the standards
in this Code should be viewed as the minimum standards that the Company expects from Covered Persons. In the event that a law conflicts
with a policy in this Code, Covered Persons must comply with the law. 

Covered Persons who are in
or aware of a situation which may violate or lead to a violation of this Code should follow the guidelines described in this policy. 

Standards of Conduct 

Conflicts of Interest 

The Company respects the privacy
of Covered Persons and their right to engage in outside activities that do not conflict with the interests of the Company or impair or
interfere with the performance of a Covered Person s duties to the Company. 

A conflict of interest 
exists when a Covered Person s personal interest interferes with the interests of the Company. Conflicts of interest may arise in
many situations. For example, a conflict of interest may arise when a Covered Person takes actions or has interests that may make it difficult
to perform his or her work for the Company objectively and effectively. It is almost always a conflict of interest for a Covered Person
to work simultaneously for a competitor, customer or supplier. Covered Persons should avoid any material business relationship with the
Company s customers, suppliers and competitors, except when acting on the Company s behalf. A conflict of interest may also
arise when any Covered Person, or any member of his or her immediate family, receives improper personal benefits as a result of the Covered
Person s position with the Company. If a Covered Person s spouse or other immediate family member works for a firm that does
business with or competes against the Company, the Compliance Officer should be advised of the situation in writing. 

The Company has the right and
obligation to determine whether conflicts of interest exist and to take appropriate action to address them. Any Covered Person who has
a question about whether or not he or she has a conflict of interest should bring it to the attention of his or her immediate supervisor
or the Compliance Officer. Before engaging in any material transaction or relationship that reasonably could give rise to a conflict of
interest, each Covered Person must provide full and fair disclosure of all relevant facts and circumstances to the Compliance Officer.
If the Covered Person is a director, executive officer or other person subject to the Company s Related Persons Transaction Policy,
the Compliance Officer will review the transaction or relationship in accordance with the Related Persons Transaction Policy and determine
whether to submit the relationship or transaction for review and approval by the Audit Committee or another independent body of the Company s
Board of Directors. In the case of any other Covered Person or in the case where the Compliance Officer determines that the relationship
or transaction does not require the review and approval of the Audit Committee or another independent body, the Compliance Officer will
determine whether or not to approve the relationship or transaction. 

Compliance with Laws, Rules and Regulations 

The Company seeks to conduct its
business in compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations. No Covered Person should engage in any unlawful activity in conducting
the Company s business or in performing his or her day-to-day duties, nor should any Covered Person instruct others to do so. This
Code should be read in conjunction with the Company s Employee Resource Guide and other existing policies, practices and procedures,
including but not limited to the LendingTree Securities Trading Policy, the Policy Regarding Employee Reporting of Financial Audit
Related Concerns, and the Company s policies and agreements concerning proprietary inventions, trade secrets and employee conduct. 

Protection and Proper Use of the Company s
Assets 

Loss, theft and misuse of the
Company s assets has a direct impact on the Company s business and its profitability. Covered Persons are expected to protect
the Company s assets that are entrusted to them and to protect the Company s assets in general. Covered Persons are also expected
to take steps to ensure that the Company s assets are used only for legitimate business purposes. 

Confidentiality 

Confidential information generated
and gathered in the Company s business plays a vital role in the Company s business, prospects and ability to compete. Confidential
information includes all non- public information that might be of use to competitors, or harmful to the Company or its customers
or suppliers, if disclosed. It can also include information entrusted to the Company by its suppliers or customers. Covered Persons must
maintain the confidentiality of such confidential information, except when disclosure is authorized by the Company or required by applicable
law, rule or regulation or pursuant to an applicable legal proceeding. Covered Persons may only use confidential information for legitimate
Company purposes. 

Covered Persons must return all
of the Company s confidential and/or proprietary information in their possession to the Company when they cease to be employed by
or otherwise serve the Company. 

Fair Dealing 

Competing vigorously, yet lawfully,
with competitors and establishing advantageous, but fair, business relationships with consumers, vendors, lenders, other customers, third-party
intermediaries and suppliers is a part of the foundation for long-term success. Unlawful and unethical conduct, even if it leads to short-term
gains, may damage a company s reputation and long-term business prospects. Accordingly, it is the Company s policy that Covered
Persons endeavor to deal ethically and lawfully with the Company s consumers, vendors, lenders, other customers, third-party intermediaries,
suppliers and competitors and their respective employees in all business dealings on the Company s behalf. 

Accuracy of Records 

It is the Company s policy
to maintain its books, records, accounts and financial statements in reasonable detail so that they appropriately reflect the Company s
transactions and conform both to applicable legal requirements and to the Company s system of internal controls. No Covered Person
may cause the Company to enter into a transaction with the intent to document it or record it in a deceptive or unlawful manner. No Covered
Person may create any false or artificial documentation for any transaction entered into by the Company. Unrecorded or off the
books funds or assets should not be maintained unless permitted by applicable law or regulation and brought to the attention of
the Company s Chief Accounting Officer. 

Disclosure and Financial Reporting 

The Company is committed to providing
full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in all reports and documents filed with or submitted to the Securities and
Exchange Commission SEC and in all other public communications made by the Company. It is the Company s policy to
maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by the Company in
the reports it files with or submits to the SEC is recorded, processed, summarized and reported accurately, within the time periods specified
in the SEC s rules and forms. Covered Persons responsible for SEC filings and submissions and other public disclosures should report
financial results in a way that enables the Company to fairly present the consolidated financial position and the consolidated results
of operations and cash flows of the Company in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, applied
on a consistent basis. 

Any Covered Person who learns
of any material information affecting or potentially affecting the accuracy or adequacy of the disclosures made by the Company in its
SEC filings, submissions or other public statements should report the same to the Compliance Officer or through the procedures established
from time to time by the Audit Committee for the receipt, retention, and treatment of complaints received by the Company regarding accounting,
internal accounting controls or auditing matters, as set forth below. 

Improper Influence of Auditors 

No Covered Person may take any
action to fraudulently influence, coerce, manipulate or mislead the Company s auditor of the Company s financial statements
for the purpose of rendering those financial statements materially misleading. 

Accepting or Offering Gifts and Gratuities 

No Covered Person may offer or
give (directly or indirectly) any improper gift, favor, kickback or other improper payment or consideration to any customer, supplier,
government official, including, without limitation, any foreign government official, or any other person for assistance or influence concerning
any transaction affecting the Company. No Covered Person may ask for or accept (directly or indirectly) any improper gift, favor, kickback
or other improper payment or consideration from a customer, government official or any other person in consideration for assistance or
influence concerning any transaction affecting the Company. Any Covered Person aware of a person offering, giving, asking for or accepting
an offer of a gift, gratuity or other personal consideration to influence a business transaction affecting the Company should report the
same to the Compliance Officer or through the procedures established from time to time by the Audit Committee for the receipt, retention,
and treatment of complaints received by the Company regarding accounting, internal accounting controls or auditing matters, as set forth
below. 

These provisions are not intended
to apply to routine, reasonable business entertainment or gifts of minor value customary in local business relationships, provided that
no laws or Company policies, including but not limited to, the Company s Gifts and Gratuities Policy, are violated. 

Compliance Procedures 

Communications of this Code 

All Covered Persons will be provided
with a copy of this Code upon beginning service with the Company. Updates to this Code will be provided from time to time. The standards
in this Code may be further explained or implemented through the Company s Employee Resource Guide and other policy memoranda, including
those relating to specific areas of the Company s business. A Covered Person may obtain a copy of this Code or any such memoranda
upon request to the Compliance Officer. This Code is also available via the Company s intranet or by accessing the Investors 
section of the Company s website at www.borrowmoney.com/investor-relations 

Monitoring Compliance and Disciplinary Action 

The Company s management,
under the supervision of its Board of Directors or a committee thereof or, in the case of accounting, internal accounting controls or
auditing matters, the Audit Committee, will take reasonable steps from time to time to (i) monitor compliance with this Code, including
the establishment of monitoring systems that are reasonably designed to investigate and detect conduct in violation of this Code and (ii)
when appropriate, impose and enforce appropriate disciplinary measures for violations of this Code. 

The Company s management
will periodically report to the Board of Directors or a committee thereof on these compliance efforts including, without limitation, periodic
reporting of alleged violations of this Code and the actions taken with respect to any such violation. 

Reporting Concerns/ Receiving Advice/ No Retaliation 

Be Proactive . Every Covered
Person is expected to act proactively by asking questions, seeking guidance and reporting violations of this Code and other policies and
procedures of the Company, as well as any violation of applicable law, rule or regulation arising in the conduct of the Company s
business or occurring on the Company s property. If any Covered Person believes that actions have taken place, may be taking
place, or may be about to take place that violate or would violate this Code, he or she is expected to bring the matter to the attention
of a supervisor, the Compliance Officer or report the matter through the procedures established from time to time by the Audit Committee
for the receipt, retention, and treatment of complaints received by the Company regarding accounting, internal accounting controls or
auditing matters, as set forth below. 

Seeking Guidance . The best
starting point for a Covered Person seeking advice on ethics-related issues or reporting potential violations of this Code will usually
be his or her immediate supervisor. However, if the conduct in question involves the Covered Person s immediate supervisor, if the
Covered Person does not have an immediate supervisor, if the Covered Person has reported the conduct in question to his or her immediate
supervisor and does not believe that he or she has dealt with it properly, or if the Covered Person does not feel that he or she can discuss
the matter with his or her immediate supervisor, the Covered Person may raise the matter By e-mail to lega@borrowmoney.com (anonymity
cannot be maintained). 

Reporting Accounting and Other
Concerns . Any Covered Person who learns of any violation or potential violation concerning accounting, internal accounting controls
or auditing matters should promptly bring the matter to the Audit Committee. Accounting, internal accounting control and auditing matters
include but are not limited to information concerning (i) significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in the design or operation of
internal controls which could adversely affect the Company s ability to record, process, summarize and report financial data accurately,
(ii) any fraud, whether or not material, involving management or other employees who have a significant role in the Company s financial
reporting, disclosures or internal controls, (iii) improper influence of an auditor of the Company s financial statements or (iv)
the accuracy or adequacy of the disclosures made by the Company in its SEC filings or submissions or other public disclosures. 

Anonymity . When reporting
suspected violations of this Code, the Company prefers that Covered Persons identify themselves in order to facilitate the Company s
ability to take appropriate steps to address the report, including conducting any appropriate investigation. However, the Company also
recognizes that some people may feel more comfortable reporting a suspected violation anonymously. If a Covered Person wishes to remain
anonymous, he or she may do so, and the Company will use reasonable efforts to protect the confidentiality of the reporting person subject
to applicable law, rule or regulation or to any applicable legal proceedings. In the event the report is made anonymously, however, the
Company may not have sufficient information to look into or otherwise investigate or evaluate the allegations. Accordingly, Covered Persons
who make reports anonymously should provide as much detail as is reasonably necessary to permit the Company to evaluate the matter(s)
set forth in the anonymous report and, if appropriate, commence and conduct an appropriate investigation. 

Protection for Reporting
Violations . It is prohibited, and is a violation of this Code, for the Company or any person to retaliate in any way against any Covered
Person who, acting in good faith, reports information concerning suspected misconduct. 

Misuse of Reporting Channels .
Covered Persons may not use these reporting channels in bad faith or in a false or frivolous manner. 

Enforcement 

Investigating Reports of Violations .
The Company is committed to full, prompt and fair enforcement of the provisions of this Code. Upon receipt of any concern, other than
an accounting, internal accounting control or auditing concern, the Compliance Officer will promptly initiate an investigation to gather
the relevant facts. Upon receipt of any accounting, internal accounting control and auditing concern, the Audit Committee will promptly
initiate an investigation to gather the relevant facts. In conducting and monitoring investigations, the Compliance Officer or Audit Committee,
as applicable, may consult and coordinate as appropriate with other Covered Persons, including but not limited to members of the Company s
senior management team, Internal Audit Department, Finance Department or Human Resources Department, and will seek to ensure that the
provisions of this Code are applied and enforced consistently across the Company. All lawful and appropriate investigative means and methods
may be utilized in the conduct of the investigation. All Covered Persons should cooperate in the investigation when called upon to do
so. A failure to cooperate may itself constitute a violation of the Code. 

Sanctions for Violations .
Appropriate disciplinary action will be determined upon completion of the investigation, if the Compliance Officer or Audit Committee,
as applicable, concludes that a violation of the Code has been committed and disciplinary action is warranted. Any violation of this Code
may result in serious sanctions by the Company, which may include but is not limited to, dismissal, suspension without pay, loss of pay
or bonus, loss of benefits or demotion. 

Any disciplinary action to be
taken against an employee will be subject to the approval of senior management and will be carried out by the Human Resources Department. 

Waivers of the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics 

No waiver of any provisions of
this Code for the benefit of a director or officer (which includes without limitation, for purposes of this Code, the Company s
principal executive, financial and accounting officers) will be effective unless (i) approved by the Board of Directors or, if permitted,
a committee thereof, and (ii) if applicable, such waiver is promptly disclosed to the Company s shareholders in accordance with
applicable United States securities laws and/or the rules and regulations of the NASDAQ Stock Market, as the case may be. 

Any waivers of this Code for other
employees or consultants may be made by the Compliance Officer, the Company s Chief Executive Officer, the Board of Directors or,
if permitted, a committee thereof. 

All amendments to this Code must
be approved by the Board of Directors or a committee thereof and, if applicable, must be promptly disclosed to the Company s shareholders
in accordance with applicable United States securities laws and/or the rules and regulations of S.E.C.
