Unless the context is otherwise, the forward-looking statements included or incorporated by reference in this Form 10-K and those reports, statements, information and announcements address activities, events or developments that Hawkeye Systems, Inc. (hereinafter referred to as we, us, our, our Company or Hawkeye expects or anticipates, will or may occur in the future. Any statements in this document about expectations, beliefs, plans, objectives, assumptions or future events or performance are not historical facts and are forward-looking statements. These statements are often, but not always, made through the use of words or phrases such as may, should, could, predict, potential, believe, will likely result, expect, will continue, anticipate, seek, estimate, intend, plan, projection, would and outlook, and similar expressions. Accordingly, these statements involve estimates, assumptions and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in them. Any forward-looking statements are qualified in their entirety by reference to the factors discussed throughout this document. All forward-looking statements concerning economic conditions, rates of growth, rates of income or values as may be included in this document are based on information available to us on the dates noted, and we assume no obligation to update any such forward-looking statements. It is important to note that our actual results may differ materially from those in such forward-looking statements due to fluctuations in interest rates, inflation, government regulations, economic conditions and competitive product and pricing pressures in the geographic and business areas in which we conduct operations, including our plans, objectives, expectations and intentions and other factors discussed elsewhere in this Report.

Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which it is made and we do not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statement or statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which such statement is made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. The risks and uncertainties we currently face are not the only ones we face. New factors emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict which will arise. There may be additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial to our business. In addition, we cannot assess the impact of each factor on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. If any such risks occur, our business, operating results, liquidity and financial condition could be materially affected in an adverse manner. Under such circumstances, you may lose all or part of your investment. The industry and market data contained in this report are based either on our management s own estimates or, where indicated, independent industry publications, reports by governmental agencies or market research firms or other published independent sources and, in each case, are believed by our management to be reasonable estimates.

We have not independently verified market and industry data from third-party sources. In addition, consumption patterns and customer preferences can and do change. As a result, you should be aware that market share, ranking and other similar data set forth herein, and estimates and beliefs based on such data, may not be verifiable or reliable. 3 Table of Contents Item 1. Description of Business General We were incorporated on May 15, 2018 in the State of Nevada. We are a technology holding company previously with a focus on pandemic management products and services and currently seeking other opportunities. The Company looks to license acquire technology that improves life and works with partners to develop cutting edge, smart products for a variety of markets. From inception until the date of this filing our activities have primarily consisted of (i) the incorporation of our company, (ii) the development of our business plan, (iii) development of various products, (iv) recruiting and adding additional consultants and employees, (v) signing contracts for the business, and (vi) advancing the sale of PPE products through numerous sources. Our business office is located at 6605 Abercorn, Suite 204, Savannah, GA 31405. Our telephone number is 912-253-0375 and our website is www.hawkeyesystemsinc.com. Business Description In July 2021, the Company determined to cease operations of its PPE business since continued business in that sector was not a productive use of the Company s resources. Our current business plan is to serve as a vehicle for the acquisition of or merger or consolidation with another company (a target business ). We intend to use capital stock, debt or a combination of these to effect a business combination with a target business which we believe has significant growth potential. The business combination may be with a financially stable, mature company or a company that is in its early stages of development or growth, which could include companies seeking to obtain capital and to improve their financial stability. We will not restrict our search to any particular industry. Rather, we may investigate businesses of essentially any kind or nature and participate in any type of business that may, in our management s opinion, meet our business objectives as described in this report. We emphasize that the description in this report of our business objectives is extremely general and is not meant to restrict the discretion of our management to search for and enter potential business opportunities. We have not chosen the business in which we will engage and have not conducted any market studies with respect to any business or industry for you to evaluate the possible merits or risks of the target business or the industry in which we may ultimately operate. To the extent we enter into a business combination with a financially unstable company or an entity in its early stage of development or growth, including entities without established records of sales or earnings, we will become subject to numerous risks inherent in the business and operations of financially unstable and early stage or potential emerging growth companies. In addition, to the extent that we effect a business combination with an entity in an industry characterized by a high level of risk, we will become subject to the currently unascertainable risks of that industry. An extremely high level of risk frequently characterizes certain industries that experience rapid growth. In addition, although we will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular industry or target business, we cannot assure you that we will properly ascertain or assess all significant risk factors. Sources of target businesses We anticipate that target business candidates will be brought to our attention from various unaffiliated sources, including securities broker-dealers, investment bankers, venture capitalists, bankers, and other members of the financial community, who may present solicited or unsolicited proposals. Our officers and directors and their affiliates may also bring to our attention target business candidates. While we do not presently anticipate engaging the services of professional firms that specialize in business acquisitions on any formal basis, we may engage such firms in the future, in which event, we may pay a finder s fee or other compensation for such introductions if they result in consummated transactions. These fees are customarily between 1 and 5 of the size of the overall transaction, based upon a sliding scale of the amount involved. Selection of a target business and structuring of a business combination Our management will have significant flexibility in identifying and selecting a prospective target business. In evaluating a prospective target business, our management will consider, among other factors, the following: the financial condition and results of operation of the target; the growth potential of the target and that of the industry in which the target operates; 4 Table of Contents the experience and skill of the target s management and availability of additional personnel; the capital requirements of the target; the competitive position of the target; the stage of development that the target s products, processes, or services are at; the degree of current or potential market acceptance of the target s products, processes, or services; proprietary features and the degree of intellectual property or other protection of the target s products, processes, or services; the regulatory environment of the industry in which the target operates; the prospective equity interest in, and opportunity for control of, the target; and the costs associated with effecting the business combination. These criteria are not intended to be exhaustive. Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular business combination will be based, to the extent relevant, on the above factors as well as other considerations deemed relevant by our management in connection with effecting a business combination consistent with our business objective. In connection with our evaluation of a prospective target business, we anticipate that we will conduct an extensive due diligence review that will encompass, among other things, meetings with incumbent management and inspection of facilities, as well as a review of financial or other information that will be made available to us. We will endeavor to structure a business combination to achieve the most favorable tax treatment to us, the target business and both companies stockholders. We cannot assure you, however, that the Internal Revenue Service or appropriate state tax authority will agree with our tax treatment of the business combination. Until we are presented with a specific opportunity for a business combination, we are unable to ascertain with any degree of certainty the time and costs required to select and evaluate a target business and to structure and complete the business combination. We have two full-time employees devoting their time to our affairs. Any costs incurred in connection with the identification and evaluation of a prospective target business with which a business combination is not ultimately completed will result in a loss to us and reduce the amount of capital otherwise available to complete a business combination. Limited ability to evaluate the target business management Although we intend to scrutinize the management of a prospective target business before effecting a business combination, we cannot assure you that our assessment of the target s management will prove to be correct, especially considering the possible inexperience of our officers and directors in evaluating certain types of businesses. In addition, we cannot assure you that the target s future management will have the necessary skills, qualifications, or abilities to manage a public company. Furthermore, the future role of our officers and directors, if any, in the target business cannot presently be stated with any certainty. While it is possible that one or more of our officers and directors will remain associated in some capacity with us following a business combination, it is unlikely that any of them will devote their full efforts to our affairs after a business combination. Moreover, we cannot assure you that our officers and directors will have significant experience or knowledge relating to the operations of the target business. We may seek to recruit additional managers to supplement the incumbent management of the target business. We cannot assure you, however, that we will be able to recruit additional managers who have the requisite skills, knowledge or experience necessary to enhance the incumbent management. 5 Table of Contents Investment Company Act We may participate in a business or opportunity by purchasing, trading, or selling the securities of a business. We do not intend to engage primarily in these activities, and we are not registered as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940. We do not believe that registration under the act is required based upon our proposed activities. We intend to conduct our activities so as to avoid being classified as an investment company and avoid application of the costly and restrictive registration and other provisions of the Investment Company Act and its regulations. The Investment Company Act may, however, also be deemed to be applicable to a company that does not intend to be characterized as an investment company but that, nevertheless, engages in activities that may be deemed to be within the definitional scope of certain provisions of the Investment Company Act. While we do not believe that our anticipated principal activities will subject us to regulation under the Investment Company Act, we cannot assure you that we will not be deemed to be an investment company, especially during the period prior to a business combination. In the event we are deemed to be an investment company, we may become subject to certain restrictions relating to our activities and regulatory burdens, including: restrictions on the nature of our investments; and the issuance of securities, and have imposed upon us certain requirements, including: registration as an investment company; adoption of a specific form of corporate structure; and compliance with certain burdensome reporting, recordkeeping, voting, proxy and disclosure requirements and other rules and regulations. In the event we are characterized as an investment company, we would be required to comply with these additional regulatory burdens, which would require additional expense. Intellectual Property The company currently does not have IP and this is not part of our current strategy. Regulation In our current business we are subject to local, state, federal and foreign governmental laws and regulations. Upon completion of an acquisition, we will have significant additional regulation based on the nature of the business. Prior Investment in Radiant Images, Inc.

During our fiscal year ended June 30, 2020, we raised approximately 512,500 from private offerings of our common stock and an additional 221,000 from exercise of warrants. We raised additional funds of 277,000 from a related party, paid directly for the purchase of PPE, which is included in common stock payable, as of June 30, 2020. We raised an additional 383,500 from convertible notes. Total operating expenses in the year ended June 30, 2020 were 2,217,981 compared to 1,356,340 for the same period in 2019. The increase in operating expenses is primarily a result of increased compensation, professional fees and a result of write down of inventory. The Company s net loss was 2,600,468 for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020 compared to 1,866,998 for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019. The net loss for this period is a result of general and administrative costs, professional fees, management compensation and significant cost of sales. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our cash balance at June 30, 2021 was 282,131 compared to 911,747 at June 30, 2020. We do not believe these cash reserves are sufficient to cover our expenses for our operations for fiscal year ending June 30, 2022. We will require additional funding for our ongoing operations. While we have a loan payable from Radiant Systems of 1,305,800 and interest due from Radiant of 154,042, those amounts are reflected impaired on our balance sheet as a result of the litigation with Radiant. Nevertheless, we intend to vigorously pursue that litigation and expect to recover those amounts. 10 Table of Contents In addition, we intend to raise funds through the sale of equity and the exercise of warrants issued in private placements. Although to date we have had some warrant exercises for cash, there can be no assurance that we will be able to raise money through this offering or through the exercise of warrants. If we cannot raise any additional financing prior to the expiration of the first quarter of 2021, we believe we will be able to obtain loans from management in the future, if necessary, but have no agreement in writing. We are an emerging growth company and have limited revenue to date. Under a limited operations scenario to maintain our corporate existence, we believe we will require additional funds over the next 12 months to complete our regulatory reporting and filings. However, we will require maximum participation through private placements, warrant exercises or alternative financings to implement our complete business plan. There are no assurances that we will be able to obtain further funds required for our continued operations. Even if additional financing is available, it may not be available on terms we find favorable. Failure to secure the needed additional financing will have an adverse effect on our ability to remain in business. Plan of Operation and Funding We expect that working capital requirements will continue to be funded through equity offerings, warrant exercises, and related party advances in the near term. We have no guarantees or firm commitments that the related party advances will continue in the near term. Existing working capital, further advances, together with anticipated capital raises and anticipated cash flow are expected to be adequate to fund our operations over the next twelve months. We have no lines of credit or other bank financing arrangements. Generally, we have financed operations to date through proceeds from the sale of our common stock, warrant exercises and convertible loans. Management anticipates additional increases in operating expenses relating to: (i) developmental expenses; and (ii) marketing expenses. We intend to finance these expenses with issuances of securities and through the exercise of outstanding warrants. Additional issuances of equity or convertible debt securities will result in dilution to our current shareholders. Further, such securities might have rights, preferences or privileges senior to our common stock. Additional financing may not be available upon acceptable terms, or at all. If adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms, we may not be able to take advantage of prospective new business endeavors or opportunities, which could significantly and materially restrict our business operations. Material Commitments As of the date of this Current Report, we do not have any material commitments. Purchase of Significant Equipment We do not intend to purchase any significant equipment during the next twelve months. 11 Table of Contents Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements As of the date of this Current Report, we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors. Going Concern As reflected in the accompanying financial statements, the Company had an accumulated deficit of approximately 9,251,675 at June 30, 2021 and net loss from operations of 2,603,033. The Company does not yet have a history of financial stability. Historically, the principal source of liquidity has been the issuance of equity securities and related party advances. In addition, the Company is in the development stage and has generated limited revenues since inception. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The ability of the Company to continue operations is dependent on the success of Management s plans and raising of capital through the issuance of equity securities, until such time that funds provided by operations are sufficient to fund working capital requirements. The Company will require additional funding to finance the growth of its current and expected future operations as well as to achieve its strategic objectives. The Company believes its current available cash may be insufficient to meet its cash needs for the near future. There can be no assurance that financing will be available in amounts or terms acceptable to the Company, if at all. The accompanying financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. These financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recovery of the recorded assets or the classification of the liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.

Opinion on the Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Hawkeye Systems, Inc. (the Company as of June 30, 2021 and 2020, the related statement of operations, stockholders equity (deficit), and cash flows for the years then ended, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements ). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of June 30, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Substantial Doubt about the Company s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 3 to the financial statements, the Company s significant operating losses raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. /s/ BF Borgers CPA PC BF Borgers CPA PC Served as Auditor since 2018 Lakewood, CO October 13, 2021 F-1 Table of Contents HAWKEYE SYSTEMS, INC.

The Company is committed to leveraging its extensive resources in support of its ongoing mission to help our government and medical infrastructure to keep civilians safe. Starting 2020, the Company began sourcing and distributing PPE (Personal Protective Equipment) and other pandemic management supplies to enterprise level customers and government agencies. The Company also looks to license acquire technology that improves life and works with partners to develop cutting edge, smart products for a variety of markets. Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Basis of presentation The accompanying financial statements were prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America U.S. GAAP ). Use of estimates The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The Company regularly evaluates estimates and assumptions. The Company bases its estimates and assumptions on current facts, historical experience and various other factors that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the accrual of costs and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. To the extent there are material differences between the estimates and the actual results, future results of operations will be affected. The actual results experienced by the Company may differ materially and adversely from the Company s estimates. Significant estimates in the accompanying financial statements include useful lives of property and equipment, fair value assumptions used for stock-based compensation, and the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets. Cash The Company considers cash in banks and other deposits with an original maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash and cash equivalents. There were no cash equivalents as of June 30, 2021 and 2020. Financial instruments For certain of the Company s financial instruments, including cash, note and interest receivable, convertible note payable, and notes payable, related party, the carrying amounts approximate their fair values due to their short maturities. Accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts Trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest. The allowance for doubtful accounts is the Company s best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in its existing accounts receivable. The Company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments for services or goods. Accounts with known financial issues are first reviewed and specific estimates are recorded. The remaining accounts receivable balances are then grouped in categories by the number of days the balance is past due, and the estimated loss is calculated as a percentage of the total category based upon past history. Account balances are charged against the allowance when it is probable that the receivable will not be recovered. The Company had no allowance for doubtful accounts at June 30, 2021 or 2020. Inventory Inventories, consisting of finished goods and goods in transit, are primarily accounted for using the first-in-first-out FIFO method of accounting. Inventories are measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value. The Company estimates the net realizable value of inventories based on an assessment of expected sales prices. F-6 Table of Contents Property and equipment Property and equipment are recorded at cost. Repair and maintenance costs that do not improve service potential or extend economic life are expensed as incurred. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. The useful life of computer equipment is five years Certain events or changes in circumstances may indicate that the recoverability of the carrying amount of property, plant and equipment should be assessed, including, among others, a significant decrease in market value, a significant change in the business climate in a particular market, or a current period operating or cash flow loss combined with historical losses or projected future losses. When such events or changes in circumstances are present and an impairment test is performed, we estimate the future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset or asset group and its eventual disposition. If the sum of the expected future cash flows is less than the carrying amount, we recognize an impairment loss. The impairment loss recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value. Fair value measurements When required to measure assets or liabilities at fair value, the Company uses a fair value hierarchy based on the level of independent, objective evidence surrounding the inputs used. The Company determines the level within the fair value hierarchy in which the fair value measurements in their entirety fall. The categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Level 1 uses quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities, Level 2 uses significant other observable inputs, and Level 3 uses significant unobservable inputs. The amount of the total gains or losses for the period are included in earnings that are attributable to the change in unrealized gains or losses relating to those assets and liabilities still held at the reporting date. The Company has no assets or liabilities that are adjusted to fair value on a recurring basis. Convertible financial instruments The Company bifurcates conversion options from their host instruments and accounts for them as free-standing derivative financial instruments if certain criteria are met. The criteria include circumstances in which (a) the economic characteristics and risks of the embedded derivative instrument are not clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics and risks of the host contract, (b) the hybrid instrument that embodies both the embedded derivative instrument and the host contract is not remeasured at fair value under otherwise applicable generally accepted accounting principles with changes in fair value reported in earnings as they occur, and (c) a separate instrument with the same terms as the embedded derivative instrument would be considered a derivative instrument. An exception to this rule is when the host instrument is deemed to be conventional, as that term is described under applicable U.S. GAAP. When the Company has determined that the embedded conversion options should not be bifurcated from their host instruments, discounts are recorded for the intrinsic value of conversion options embedded in the instruments based upon the differences between the fair value of the underlying common stock at the commitment date of the transaction and the effective conversion price embedded in the instrument. Common stock purchase warrants and derivative financial instruments Common stock purchase warrants and other derivative financial instruments are classified as equity if the contracts (1) require physical settlement or net-share settlement, or (2) give the Company a choice of net-cash settlement or settlement in its own shares (physical settlement or net-share settlement). Contracts which (1) require net-cash settlement (including a requirement to net cash settle the contract if an event occurs and if that event is outside the control of the Company), (2) give the counterparty a choice of net-cash settlement or settlement in shares (physical settlement or net-share settlement), or (3) that contain reset provisions that do not qualify for the scope exception are classified as liabilities. The Company assesses classification of its common stock purchase warrants and other derivatives at each reporting date to determine whether a change in classification between equity and liabilities is required. Beneficial conversion feature The issuance of the convertible debt generated a beneficial conversion feature BCF ), which arises when a debt or equity security is issued with an embedded conversion option that is beneficial to the investor or in the money at inception because the conversion option has an effective strike price that is less than the market price of the underlying stock at the commitment date. The Company recognized the BCF by allocating the intrinsic value of the conversion option, which is the number of shares of common stock available upon conversion multiplied by the difference between the effective conversion price per share and the fair value of common stock per share on the commitment date, resulting in a discount on the convertible debt (recorded as a component of additional paid-in capital). The discount is amortized to interest expense over the term of the convertible debt. F-7 Table of Contents Income taxes The Company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes, whereby deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences, and deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences. Temporary differences are the differences between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, the Company does not foresee generating taxable income in the near future and utilizing its deferred tax asset, therefore, it is more likely than not that some portion, or all of, the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment. A tax position is recognized as a benefit only if it is more likely than not that the tax position would be sustained in a tax examination, with a tax examination being presumed to occur. The amount recognized is the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50 likely of being realized on examination. For tax positions not meeting the more likely than not test, no tax benefit is recorded. The Company has no material uncertain tax positions for any of the reporting periods presented. Revenue recognition Revenue is recorded in accordance with Accounting Standards Update ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers Topic 606 ). Revenue is recognized from product sales when goods are shipped, title and risk of loss have transferred to the purchaser, there are no significant vendor obligations, the fees are fixed or determinable, and collection is reasonably assured. Amounts billed to customers for shipping and handling are included in net sales. Costs associated with shipping and handling are included in cost of goods sold. The Company recognizes sales on a gross basis when it is considered the primary obligor in the transaction and on a net basis when it is considered to be acting as an agent. We record estimates for cash discounts, product returns, and other discounts in the period of the sale. This provision is recorded as a reduction from gross sales and the reserves are shown as a reduction of accounts receivable. Cost of sales Cost of sales includes inventory costs and shipping and freight expenses. Related parties The Company follows ASC 850, Related Party Disclosures, for the identification of related parties and disclosure of related party transactions. Commitments and contingencies The Company follows ASC 450-20 , Loss Contingencies , to report accounting for contingencies. Liabilities for loss contingencies arising from claims, assessments, litigation, fines and penalties and other sources are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the assessment can be reasonably estimated. Basic and diluted earnings per share Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share is calculated based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period plus the effect of potentially dilutive common stock equivalents, including stock options, warrants to purchase the Company s common stock, and convertible note payable. For the years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, potentially dilutive common stock equivalents not included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share because they were anti-dilutive are as follows: June 30, 2021 June 30, 2020 Warrants 3,069,329 7,047,135 Options 7,280,000 5,255,000 Convertible notes 2,000,000 1,000,000 Total possible dilutive shares 12,349,329 13,302,135 F-8 Table of Contents Stock-based compensation Stock-based compensation to employees and non-employees consist of stock options grants, warrants to purchase common stock, and restricted shares that are recognized in the statement of operations based on their fair values at the date of grant. The fair value of share of common stock is based on the trading price of the Company s share. The Company calculates the fair value of option and warrant grants utilizing the Black-Scholes pricing model. Assumptions used by the Company in using the Black-Scholes pricing model include: 1) volatility based on the Company s average volatility rate, 2) risk free interest rate based on the U.S. Treasury yield for a term consistent with the expected life of the awards in effect at the time of the grant, 3) the expected life of the option or warrants, and 4) expected cash dividend rate on shares of common stock. During the year ending June 30, 2021 and 2020, volatility was based on average rates for similar publicly traded companies. The amount of stock-based compensation recognized during a period is based on the value of the portion of the awards that are ultimately expected to vest. The resulting stock-based compensation expense for employee awards is generally recognized on a straight- line basis over the vesting period of the award. Reclassifications Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform with the current year presentation.

The standard reduced the number of accounting models for convertible debt instruments and convertible preferred stock. Convertible instruments that continue to be subject to separation models are (1) those with embedded conversion features that are not clearly and closely related to the host contract, that meet the definition of a derivative, and that do not qualify for a scope exception from derivative accounting; and, (2) convertible debt instruments issued with substantial premiums for which the premiums are recorded as paid-in capital. The amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted, but no earlier than fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is currently assessing the impact of the adoption of this standard on its consolidated financial statements. Note 3 - Going Concern The Company s financial statements are prepared using U.S. GAAP, applicable to a going concern which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. During the year ended June 30, 2021, the Company had a net loss of 4,741,833. As of June 30, 2021, the Company had an accumulated deficit of 9,251,674. The Company has not established sufficient revenue to cover its operating costs and will require additional capital to continue its operating plan. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on the Company obtaining adequate capital to fund operating losses until it becomes profitable. If the Company is unable to obtain adequate capital, it could be forced to cease operations. These factors raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. In order to continue as a going concern, the Company will need, among other things, additional capital resources. Management s plan to obtain such resources for the Company includes: sales of equity instruments; traditional financing, such as loans; and obtaining capital from management and significant stockholders sufficient to meet its minimum operating expenses. However, management cannot provide any assurance that the Company will be successful in accomplishing this plan. F-9 Table of Contents There is no assurance that the Company will be able to obtain sufficient additional funds when needed or that such funds, if available, will be obtainable on terms satisfactory to the Company. In addition, profitability will ultimately depend upon the level of revenues received from business operations. However, there is no assurance that the Company will attain profitability. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.

Because of its inherent limitations, which include a process that involves human diligence and compliance and is subject to lapses in judgment and breakdowns resulting from human failures, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatement, whether unintentional errors or fraud. s. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives. Our management, consisting of Corby Marshall as Chief Executive Officer and Christopher Mulgrew as Chief Financial Officer, reviewed and evaluated the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(3) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act)) and financial reporting as of June 30, 2021. In making this assessment, our management used the criteria described in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), as well as the guidance provided in SEC Release 33-8809. In such evaluation, Mr. Marshall and Mr. Mulgrew assessed daily interaction, self-assessment and other on going monitoring activities as evidence in the evaluation. Furthermore we sought to identify financial reporting risks, identify controls that adequately address financial reporting risks, considered entity level controls, reviewed the role of technology in our controls and reviewed the evidence available to support the assessment. Based on this evaluation, our management concluded that, as of June 30, 2021, our disclosure controls and our internal controls over financial reporting were not effective in recording, processing, summarizing and report on a time basis information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act and were not effective in assuring that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act due to material weaknesses including (i) the Company having only two officers handling all financial transactions, (ii) lack of appropriate operational controls and consistency in providing our accounting personnel with financial information, (iii) incomplete financial statements on a daily basis and resulting errors in our underlying accounting system, (iv) lack of proper documentation of our assessment and evaluation, and (v) our determination that internal controls were ineffective due to the limited segregation of duties because of the limited management structure. In response to that assessment we have made a determination that all accounting and financial reporting services should be outsourced to a qualified consulting firm and we immediately engaged a new financial services provider. We subsequently replaced that provider with an internal accounting contractor. We have also made the determination that we need to dedicate more of the company s current and future financial resources to this function and engaged a permanent Chief Financial Officer. This annual report does not include an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management s report was not subject to attestation by our registered public accounting firm pursuant to rules of the SEC that permits us to provide only management s report in this annual report. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Other than engaging a new financial services firm to provide financial statements, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fourth quarter of the year ended June 30, 2021 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 14 Table of Contents Item 9B.
