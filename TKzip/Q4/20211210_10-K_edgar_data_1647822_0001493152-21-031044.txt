Market
Analysis 

The
global pandemic upended business as usual across all industries. As social distancing and working remotely took hold, companies accelerated
the need for technology to support everything from onsite repairs to training employees. Under COVID-19, the world has gone into isolation.
Social distancing is currently the most effective way to slow the spread of the virus until a vaccine can be found to protect the population.
As a result, anything that relies on human-to-human contact which is to say, most aspects of our lives must be amended to
account for the dangers of the virus. 
 
Digitization has stepped in to bridge the gaps left by mandated shutdowns and social distancing measures. Without digital tools and technologies,
we would have no way to work, shop, go to school, and more. As such, this industry has a large potential to grow. 

Patent
and Trademarks 

We
do not currently own any domestic or foreign patents relating to our business.

Going
Concern 

Our
auditor has indicated in their reports on our financial statements for the fiscal years ended May 31, 2021, that conditions
exist that raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern due to our recurring losses from operations, deficit
in equity, and the need to raise additional capital to fund operations. A going concern opinion could impair our ability
to finance our operations through the sale of debt or equity securities. 

Results
of Operations 

Fiscal
Year Ended May 31, 2021 and Fiscal Year Ended May 31, 2020 

For
the year ended May 31, 2021, we had generated revenue of 10,000. We had cost of revenue of 3,000 .
 We incurred operating expenses of 48,477. Our operating expenses include professional services
expenses and transfer agent fee. We had net loss of 41,477. 

The
company had no operations and expenses for the year ended May 31, 2020. 

Capital
Resources and Liquidity 

Fiscal
Year Ended May 31, 2021 and Fiscal Year Ended May 31, 2020 

Cash
Used in Operating Activities 

For
the years ended May 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company had cash used in operating activities in the amount of 29,477 and 0, respectively,
which were primarily due to net loss for the year, and accounts payable and accrued liabilities. 

Cash
Provided by Financing Activities 

For
the years ended May 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company realized cash provided by financing activities in the amount of 30,292 and 0, respectively,
which was advances from our CEO for working capital purposes. 

As
of May 31, 2021, we have cash of 815. As of May 31, 2020, we had no cash. 

Our
auditors have issued a going concern opinion, meaning that there is substantial doubt if we can continue as an on-going
business for the next twelve months unless we obtain additional capital. No substantial revenues are anticipated until we have implemented
our plan of operations. 

8 

The
Company requires additional funding to meet its ongoing obligations and to fund anticipated operating losses. Our auditor has expressed
substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent
on raising capital to fund its initial business plan and ultimately to attain profitable operations. These financial statements do not
include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts, or amounts and classification of
liabilities that might result from this uncertainty. 

We
expect to incur marketing and professional and administrative expenses as well expenses associated with maintaining our filings with
the Commission. We will require additional funds during this time and will seek to raise the necessary additional capital. If we are
unable to obtain additional financing, we may be required to reduce the scope of our business development activities, which could harm
our business plans, financial condition and operating results. Additional funding may not be available on favorable terms, if at all.
The Company intends to continue to fund its business by way of equity or debt financing and advances from related parties. Any inability
to raise capital as needed would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

If
we cannot raise additional funds, we will have to cease business operations. As a result, investors in the Company s common stock
would lose all of their investment. 

Off
Balance Sheet Arrangements 

There
are no off-balance sheet arrangements currently contemplated by management or in place that are reasonably likely to have a current or
future effect on the business, financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenue or expenses, result of operations, liquidity,
capital expenditures and/or capital resources. 

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements 

The
Company has implemented all new accounting pronouncements that are in effect and that may impact its financial statements and does not
believe that there are any other new accounting pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material impact on its financial
position or results of operations.

ITEM
9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURES 

There
have been no changes in or disagreements with accountants regarding our accounting, financial disclosures or any other matter. 

ITEM
9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

The
management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as required
by Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX) Section 404 A. The Company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed under the
supervision of the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the Company s financial statements for external purposes in accordance
with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 

Management
assessed the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria for effective internal
control over financial reporting established in SEC guidance on conducting such assessments as of the end of the period covered by this
report. Management conducted the assessment based on certain criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by
the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this assessment, management concluded that our internal
controls over financial reporting were not effective as of May 31, 2021. 

The
matters involving internal controls and procedures that the Company s management considered to be material weaknesses under the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board were: (1) lack of a functioning audit committee and lack of a majority of
outside directors on the Company s board of directors, resulting in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of
required internal controls and procedures; (2) inadequate segregation of duties consistent with control objectives; (3) insufficient
written policies and procedures for accounting and financial reporting with respect to the requirements and application of US GAAP and
SEC disclosure requirements; and (4) ineffective controls over period end financial disclosure and reporting processes. The aforementioned
material weaknesses were identified by the Company s Chief Financial Officer in connection with the review of our financial statements
as of May 31, 2021 and communicated the matters to our management. 

10 

Management
believes that the material weaknesses set forth in items (2), (3) and (4) above did not have an effect on the Company s financial
results. However, management believes that the lack of a functioning audit committee and lack of a majority of outside directors on the
Company s board of directors, resulting in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls
and procedures can result in the Company s determination to its financial statements for the future years. 

We
are committed to improving our financial organization. As part of this commitment, we will create a position to segregate duties consistent
with control objectives and will increase our personnel resources and technical accounting expertise within the accounting function when
funds are available to the Company: i) Appointing one or more outside directors to our board of directors who shall be appointed to the
audit committee of the Company resulting in a fully functioning audit committee who will undertake the oversight in the establishment
and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures; and ii) Preparing and implementing sufficient written policies and checklists
which will set forth procedures for accounting and financial reporting with respect to the requirements and application of US GAAP and
SEC disclosure requirements. 

Management
believes that the appointment of one or more outside directors, who shall be appointed to a fully functioning audit committee, will remedy
the lack of a functioning audit committee and a lack of a majority of outside directors on the Company s Board. In addition, management
believes that preparing and implementing sufficient written policies and checklists will remedy the following material weaknesses (i)
insufficient written policies and procedures for accounting and financial reporting with respect to the requirements and application
of US GAAP and SEC disclosure requirements; and (ii) ineffective controls over period end financial close and reporting processes. Further,
management believes that the hiring of additional personnel who have the technical expertise and knowledge will result proper segregation
of duties and provide more checks and balances within the department. Additional personnel will also provide the cross training needed
to support the Company if personnel turn over issues within the department occur. This coupled with the appointment of additional outside
directors will greatly decrease any control and procedure issues the company may encounter in the future. 

11 

We
will continue to monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of our internal controls and procedures and our internal controls over financial
reporting on an ongoing basis and are committed to taking further action and implementing additional enhancements or improvements, as
necessary and as funds allow. 

This
annual report does not include an attestation report of the company s registered public accounting firm regarding internal control
over financial reporting. Management s report was not subject to attestation by the company s registered public accounting
firm pursuant to temporary rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission that permit the Company to provide only management s
report in this annual report. 

There
have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by paragraph
(d) of Rules 13a-15 or 15d-15 under the Exchange Act that occurred during the small business issuer s last fiscal year that has
materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

We
will continue to monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of our internal controls and procedures and our internal controls over financial
reporting on an ongoing basis and are committed to taking further action and implementing additional enhancements or improvements, as
necessary and as funds allow. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There
were no changes that have affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting (as
defined in Rules 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the fiscal year ended May 31, 2021.

Director
Independence 

Our
board of directors is currently composed of one member, Mr. Ma Hongyu, who do not qualify as independent directors in accordance with
the published listing requirements of the NASDAQ Global Market. The NASDAQ independence definition includes a series of objective tests,
such as that the director is not, and has not been for at least three years, one of our employees and that neither the director, nor
any of his family members has engaged in various types of business dealings with us. In addition, our board of directors has not made
a subjective determination as to each director that no relationship exists which, in the opinion of our board of directors, would interfere
with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director, though such subjective determination is
required by the NASDAQ rules. Had our board of directors made these determinations, our board of directors would have reviewed and discussed
information provided by the directors and us with regard to each director s business and personal activities and relationships
as they may relate to us and our management. 

Involvement
in Legal Proceedings 

To
our knowledge, there have been no material legal proceedings during the last ten years that would require disclosure under the federal
securities laws that are material to an evaluation of the ability or integrity of any of our directors or executive officers. 

Potential
Conflicts of Interest 

We
are not aware of any current or potential conflicts of interest with Mr. Ma, other business interests and his involvement with SavMobi
Technology Inc.

Board
Committees 

We
have not formed an Audit Committee, Compensation Committee or Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee as of the filing of this
Annual Report. Our Board of Directors performs the principal functions of an Audit Committee. We currently do not have an audit committee
financial expert on our Board of Directors. We believe that an audit committee financial expert is not required because the cost of hiring
an audit committee financial expert to act as one of our directors and to be a member of an Audit Committee outweighs the benefits of
having an audit committee financial expert at this time. 

ITEM
12. SECURITY OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS AND MANAGEMENT AND RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS 

The
following table sets forth certain information with respect to the beneficial ownership of our voting securities by (i) each director

REPORT
OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

To: 
 The
 Board of Directors and Stockholders of 

SavMobi
 Technology Inc. 

Opinion
on the Financial Statements 

We
have audited the accompanying balance sheets of SavMobi Technology Inc. (the Company) as of May 31, 2021 and 2020, and the related statements
of operations, stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended May 31, 2021, and the related
notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material
respects, the financial position of the Company as of May 31, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for
each of the two years in the period ended May 31, 2021, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America. 

Explanatory
Paragraph Regarding Going Concern 

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note
3 to the financial statements, the Company had incurred substantial losses during the year and have negative working capital, which raises
substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management s plan in regards to these matters are described
in Note 3. These financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

Basis
for Opinion 

These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s
financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities
laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company
is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits,
we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion
on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our
audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error
or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

Critical
Audit Matter 

The
Critical Audit Matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated
or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial
statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. We determined that there are no critical audit
matters.

NOTE
2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 

Basis
of Presentation 

The
accompanying audited financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles for financial
information and with the instructions to Form 10-K. They do not include all information and footnotes required by United States generally
accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements. In the opinion of Management, all adjustments considered necessary
for a fair presentation, consisting solely of normal recurring adjustments, have been made. The
Company has adopted May 31 as its fiscal year end. 

Use
of Estimates 

The
preparation of the financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect certain reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at
the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period. The management makes its best
estimate of the outcome for these items based on information available when the financial statements are prepared, however, actual results
could differ from those estimates. 

Cash
and Cash Equivalents 

Cash
and cash equivalents are carried at cost and represent cash on hand, demand deposits placed with banks or other financial institutions
and all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less as of the purchase date of such investments. Our
cash is deposited with East West Bank. 

Accounts
Receivable 

Financial
instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of accounts receivable. The Company
extends credit to its customers in the normal course of business and generally does not require collateral. The Company s credit
terms are dependent upon the segment, and the customer. The Company assesses the probability of collection from each customer at the
outset of the arrangement based on a number of factors, including the customer s payment history and its current creditworthiness.
If in management s judgment collection is not probable, the Company does not record revenue until the uncertainty is removed. 

Management
performs ongoing credit evaluations, and the Company maintains an allowance for potential credit losses based upon its loss history and
its aging analysis. The allowance for doubtful accounts is the Company s best estimate of the amount of credit losses in existing
accounts receivable. Management reviews the allowance for doubtful accounts each reporting period based on a detailed analysis of trade
receivables. In the analysis, management primarily considers the age of the customer s receivable, and also considers the creditworthiness
of the customer, the economic conditions of the customer s industry, general economic conditions and trends, and the business relationship
and history with its customers, among other factors. If any of these factors change, the Company may also change its original estimates,
which could impact the level of the Company s future allowance for doubtful accounts. If judgments regarding the collectability
of receivables were incorrect, adjustments to the allowance may be required, which would reduce profitability. 

F- 8 

Accounts
receivable are recognized and carried at the original invoice amount less an allowance for any uncollectible amounts. An estimate for
doubtful accounts receivable is made when collection of the full amount is no longer probable. Bad debts are written off as identified.
No allowance for doubtful accounts was made for the year ended May 31, 2021. 

Revenue
Recognition 

Revenue
is generated through provision of commercial mobile technical support services. Revenue is recognized when a customer obtains control
of promised goods or services and is recognized in an amount that reflects the consideration that the Company expects to receive in exchange
for those goods or services. In addition, the standard requires disclosure of the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue
and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. The amount of revenue that is recorded reflects the consideration that the Company
expects to receive in exchange for those goods and services. The Company applies the following five-step model in order to determine
this amount: 

(i)
identification of the promised goods and services in the contract; 

 (ii)
determination of whether the promised goods and services are performance obligations, including whether they are distinct in the context
of the contract; 

 (iii)
measurement of the transaction price, including the constraint on variable consideration; 

 (iv)
allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations; and 

 (v)
recognition of revenue when (or as) the Company satisfies each performance obligation. 

The
Company adopted ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). Under Topic 606, the Company records revenue when persuasive
evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the fee is fixed or determinable and collectability is probable. 

The
Company records revenue from the provision of commercial mobile technical support services on monthly basis. The Company is
operating in provision of commercial mobile technical support services in China. The Company entered into two technical support
service agreements in the beginning of 2021, which is to provide support services to clients dedicated data platform, 7x24
hours per week. The response time should be within 4 hours upon receiving the service request. 

Cost of revenues 

Cost of revenues consist of the outsourced services,
including platform storage, maintenance and development, provided by a service provider on monthly basis. 

Earnings
Per Share 

The
Company reports earnings per share in accordance with ASC 260 Earnings Per Share , which requires presentation of basic
and diluted earnings per share in conjunction with the disclosure of the methodology used in computing such earnings per share. Basic
earnings per share excludes dilution and is computed by dividing income available to common stockholders by the weighted average common
shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share takes into account the potential dilution that could occur if securities
or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised and converted into common stock. Further, if the number of common shares outstanding
increases as a result of a stock dividend or stock split or decreases as a result of a reverse stock split, the computations of a basic
and diluted earnings per share shall be adjusted retroactively for all periods presented to reflect that change in capital structure. 

The
Company s basic earnings per share is computed by dividing the net income available to holders by the weighted average number of
the Company s ordinary shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per share reflects the amount of net income available to each ordinary
share outstanding during the period plus the number of additional shares that would have been outstanding if potentially dilutive securities
had been issued. 

Fair
Value of Financial Instruments 

Fair
value is the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market
participants at the measurement date. When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities required or permitted to
be recorded at fair value, the Company considers the principal or most advantageous market in which it would transact and it considers
assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability. 

F- 9 

Authoritative
literature provides a fair value hierarchy that requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use or unobservable
inputs when measuring fair value. A financial instrument s categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest
level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement as follows: 

Level
- 1: defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; 

Level
- 2: defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable; and 

Level
- 3: defined as unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions. 

The
carrying amounts of accounts payables and accrued liabilities approximate its fair value due to its relatively short-term maturity. 

It
is not, however, practical to determine the fair value of amounts due to related party because the transactions cannot be assumed to
have been consummated at arm s length, the terms are not deemed to be market terms, there are no quoted values available for these
instruments, and an independent valuation would not be practical due to the lack of data regarding similar instruments, if any, and the
associated potential costs. 

Related
Party Transactions 

A
related party is generally defined as (i) any person that holds 10 or more of the Company s securities and their immediate families,
(ii) the Company s management, (iii) someone that directly or indirectly controls, is controlled by or is under common control
with the Company, or (iv) anyone who can significantly influence the financial and operating decisions of the Company. A transaction
is considered to be a related party transaction when there is a transfer of resources or obligations between related parties. The Company
conducts business with its related parties in the ordinary course of business. 

Transactions
involving related parties cannot be presumed to be carried out on an arm s-length basis, as the requisite conditions of competitive,
free market dealings may not exist. Representations about transactions with related parties, if made, shall not imply that the related
party transactions were consummated on terms equivalent to those that prevail in arm s-length transactions unless such representations
can be substantiated. 

Income
Taxes 

The
Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method prescribed by ASC 740 Income Taxes . Under
this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial reporting and tax bases
of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates that will be in effect in the years in which the differences are expected to reverse.
The Company records a valuation allowance to offset deferred tax assets if based on the weight of available evidence, it is more-likely-than-not
that some portion, or all, of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is
recognized as income or loss in the period that includes the enactment date. 

New
U.S. federal tax legislation, commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the U.S. Tax Reform ), was signed into
law on December 22, 2017. The U.S. Tax Reform modified the U.S. Internal Revenue Code by, among other things, reducing the statutory
U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35 to 21 for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017; limiting and/or eliminating
many business deductions; migrating the U.S. to a territorial tax system with a one-time transaction tax on a mandatory deemed repatriation
of previously deferred foreign earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries; subject to certain limitations, generally eliminating U.S. corporate
income tax on dividends from foreign subsidiaries; and providing for new taxes on certain foreign earnings. Taxpayers may elect to pay
the one-time transition tax over eight years, or in a single lump-sum payment. 

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements 

The
Company has implemented all new accounting pronouncements that are in effect and that may impact its financial statements and does not
believe that there are any other new accounting pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material impact on its financial
position or results of operations. 

COVID-19
Uncertainty 

An
outbreak of respiratory illness caused by the novel coronavirus, commonly referred as COVID-19 emerged in late 2019 and
has spread globally. The COVID-19 is considered to be highly contagious and poses a serious public health threat. The World Health Organization
labeled the COVID-19 outbreak as a pandemic on March 11, 2020, given its threat beyond a public health emergency of international concern
the organization had declared on January 30, 2020. 

The
epidemic has resulted in social-distancing restrictions, travel restrictions, and the temporary closure of stores and facilities during
the past few months. The negative impacts of the COVID-19 outbreak on our business may include, but not strictly be limited to: 

- 
 The
 uncertain economic conditions may refrain clients from engaging our services. 

- 
 The
 operations of businesses in most industries have been, and could continue to be, negatively impacted by the epidemic, which may in
 turn adversely impact their business performance. 

We
are unable to accurately predict the upcoming impact that the COVID-19 will have due to various uncertainties, including the ultimate
geographic spread of the virus, the severity of the disease, the duration of the outbreak globally, and effectiveness of the actions
that may be taken by governmental authorities. Additionally, it is possible that we may face similar difficulties from future events,
such as this, should there be at any point another global pandemic. As of the current date, we do not believe that we have been directly
impacted by Covid-19. However, economies throughout the world have been impacted significantly in a vast number of ways, and we cannot
state with any level of certainty to what extent we may have been indirectly impacted by market conditions as a result of the pandemic
and/or if the pandemic has forestalled, in any capacity, our growth to date.

NOTE
3 GOING CONCERN 

The
accompanying audited financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company continues as a going concern. As shown in the
accompanying audited financial statements, the Company has working capital deficit of 41,477, net cash flows used in operating activities
of 29,477 for the year ended May 31, 2021. This factor raises substantial doubt as to the Company s ability to continue as a going
concern. 

The
Company intends to continue to fund its business by way of private placements and advances from related parties as may be required. 

The
financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of asset carrying amounts or the
amount and classification of liabilities that may result should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.

United

The
Tax Act reduces the U.S. statutory corporate tax rate from 35 to 21 for our tax years beginning in 2018, which resulted in the re-measurement
of the federal portion of our deferred tax assets from the 35 to 21 tax rate. The Company is registered in the State of Nevada and
is subject to United States of America tax law. As of May 31, 2021, the operations in the United States of America incurred 217,574
of cumulative net operating losses (NOL s) which can be carried forward to offset future taxable income. The NOL carryforwards
begin to expire in 2041, if unutilized. The Company has provided for a full valuation allowance of approximately 45,691 against the
deferred tax assets on the expected future tax benefits from the net operating loss carryforwards as the management believes it is more
likely than not that these assets will not be realized in the future. 

The
following table sets forth the significant components of the aggregate deferred tax assets of the Company as of May 31, 2021:
