ITEM 1. BUSINESS BACKGROUND We were incorporated on January 16, 2008 under the laws of the state of Nevada as Plethora Resources Inc. to commence operations in the business of consulting to oil gas exploration companies interested in obtaining exploration and production licenses at auction for oil and gas properties in Russia. We were unable to fund our intended business and, on May 28, 2009, but effective February 1, 2009, we acquired a wholly owned subsidiary, Sync2 International Ltd, for the assumption of the debts of Sync2 Agency Ltd, a wholly owned subsidiary of Sync2 International Ltd. Sync2 Agency Ltd is an internet marketing and website development company. On May 14, 2009 we changed our name to Sync2 Networks Corp. On December 15, 2009, we shut down the operations of Sync2 Agency Ltd. after incurring substantial operating losses, and subsequently wrote-off the investment in Sync2 Agency Ltd. At the end of 2009 Sync2 International Ltd, became inactive and Sync2 Agency Ltd. was liquidated. Prior Business Operations We were previously engaged in the business of acquiring and developing internet marketing and web site development entities and/or their individual software programs designed to enable third-party clients to better market their products through the use of the internet. 2013 Change in Control On approximately August 14, 2013, there was a change in our control. In accordance with the terms and provisions of that certain escrow agreement dated March 31, 2012 (the 2012 Escrow Agreement ), Warren Gilbert, who was at the time the current President/Chief Executive Officer, Secretary, Treasurer/Chief Financial Officer and sole member of the Board of Directors, acquired in a private transaction an aggregate of 62,863,800 shares of our restricted common stock representing an equity interest of 61 of the total issued and outstanding shares. The amount of consideration paid was 325,000 and were outside funds from unrelated parties. The shares of common stock were acquired as follows: (i) 51,000,000 shares from Artur Etozov; and (ii) 11,863,800 shares from approximately ten separate shareholders each holding less than 5 of the total issued and outstanding. 3 Table of Contents Domestication of Subsidiary On April 7, 2014, our Board of Directors deemed it in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders to domesticate our subsidiary, Sync2 International Ltd., as a corporation formed under the laws of Malta to a corporation formed under the laws of the State of Nevada (the Domestication ). Under Nevada statutory law, involves the transfer of an existing corporation from one jurisdiction to another whereby Sync2 International Ltd. shall cease all operations in Malta. On May 1, 2014, we filed Articles of Domestication with the Nevada Secretary of State effecting the domestication of Sync2 International Ltd. as a corporate entity formed under the laws of the State of Nevada, which domestication provides that Sync2 International Ltd. as domesticated in the State of Nevada shall be the same entity as Sync2 International Ltd. organized under the laws of Malta. As part of the process of domestication of Sync 2 International Ltd, we recognized 516,245 of income during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2013 from the write off of the remaining assets and liabilities of Sync 2 International Ltd. Sync2 International Ltd. entity status has been revoked by the Nevada Secretary of State as of the date of this filing. FINRA Corporate Action/Information Statement on Form 14C On October 9, 2013, our Board of Directors and majority shareholders approved a reverse stock split of one for one thousand (1:1000) of our total issued and outstanding shares of common stock (the Reverse Stock Split and a change in our name from Sync2 Networks Corp. to TREX Acquisition Corp. (the Name Change ). Pursuant to our Bylaws and the Nevada Revised Statutes, a vote by the holders of at least a majority of the Company s outstanding votes was required to effectuate the Reverse Stock Split and the Name Change. Our articles of incorporation do not authorize cumulative voting. As of the record date of October 9, 2013, we had 103,046,175 voting shares of common stock issued and outstanding. The consenting stockholders of the shares of common stock were entitled to 62,863,800 votes, which represented approximately 61.0 of the voting rights associated with our shares of common stock at that time. The consenting stockholders voted in favor of the Reverse Stock Split and the Name Change described herein in a unanimous written consent dated October 9, 2013. An information statement on Form 14(c) was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on December 11, 2013. On December 11, 2013, we filed an Information Statement on Form 14(c) with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which was furnished to all holders of our common stock as of October 9, 2013, in connection with the action taken by written consent of holders of a majority of the outstanding voting power of the Company to authorize the following: (i) ratification of an amendment to the articles of incorporation (the Name Change Amendment to effectuate the Name Change and (ii) ratification of the Reverse Stock Split. Warren Gilbert was the shareholder of record who held in the aggregate a majority of our total issued and outstanding common stock and who signed the written consent of stockholders. Prior to the Reverse Stock Split, Warren Gilbert was the holder of record of 62,863,800 shares of common stock, which was 61 of the outstanding voting power of the Company at that time. The Board of Directors had previously considered factors regarding their approval of the Reverse Stock Split including, but not limited to: (i) current trading price of our shares of common stock on the OTC QB Market and potential to increase the marketability and liquidity of our common stock; (ii) possible reluctance of brokerage firms and institutional investors to recommend lower-priced stocks to their clients or to hold in their own portfolios; (iii) desire to meet future requirements of per-share price and net tangible assets and shareholders equity relating to admission for trading on other markets; and (iv) posturing us and our structure in favorable position in order to effectively negotiate with potential acquisition candidates regarding assets. Our Board of Directors approved the Name Change and the Reverse Stock Split and recommended our majority shareholders review and approve the Name Change and the Reverse Stock Split. The Reverse Stock Split was effectuated based upon the filing of appropriate documentation with FINRA. The Reverse Stock Split decreased our total issued and outstanding shares of common stock from approximately 103,046,175 shares to 103,046 shares of common stock. The common stock will continue to be 0.001 par value. Our trading symbol changed to TRXA . After the Reverse Stock Split and the Name Change, the CUSIP number for the Company became 89532J 108. All subsequent common stock references in this filing are post-Reverse Stock Split figures, unless otherwise identified. The Name Change was effectuated to better reflect our future business goal to acquire an operating business via merger or acquisition. 4 Table of Contents 2014 Change of Control During fiscal year ended June 30, 2014 and to date, we did not issue any shares of common stock other than shares issued for debt conversion as discussed below.

SECURITIES AUTHORIZED FOR ISSUANCE UNDER EQUITY COMPENSATION PLANS. As of June 30, 2021, we had no equity compensation plans which authorized an issuance of our equity securities. PENNY STOCK REGULATION Shares of our common stock will probably be subject to rules adopted the SEC that regulate broker-dealer practices in connection with transactions in penny stocks. Penny stocks are generally equity securities with a price of less than 5.00 (other than securities registered on certain national securities exchanges or quoted on the NASDAQ system, provided that current price and volume information with respect to transactions in those securities is provided by the exchange or system). The penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from those rules, deliver a standardized risk disclosure document prepared by the SEC, which contains the following: a description of the nature and level of risk in the market for penny stocks in both public offerings and secondary trading; a description of the broker s or dealer s duties to the customer and of the rights and remedies available to the customer with respect to violation to such duties or other requirements of securities laws; a brief, clear, narrative description of a dealer market, including bid and ask prices for penny stocks and the significance of the spread between the bid and ask price; a toll-free telephone number for inquiries on disciplinary actions; definitions of significant terms in the disclosure document or in the conduct of trading in penny stocks; and such other information and is in such form (including language, type, size and format), as the SEC shall require by rule or regulation. Prior to effecting any transaction in penny stock, the broker-dealer also must provide the customer the following: the bid and offer quotations for the penny stock; the compensation of the broker-dealer and its salesperson in the transaction; the number of shares to which such bid and ask prices apply, or other comparable information relating to the depth and liquidity of the market for such stock; and monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer s account. In addition, the penny stock rules require that prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from those rules, the broker-dealer must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser s written acknowledgment of the receipt of a risk disclosure statement, a written agreement to transactions involving penny stocks, and a signed and dated copy of a written suitability statement. These disclosure requirements may have the effect of reducing the trading activity in the secondary market for a stock that becomes subject to the penny stock rules. Holders of shares of our common stock may have difficulty selling those shares because our common stock will probably be subject to the penny stock rules. 10 Table of Contents TRANSFER AGENT The stock transfer agent for our securities is Equiniti, 3200 Cherry Creek South Drive, Denver, Colorado 80209.

GOING CONCERN The independent auditors report accompanying our June 30, 2021 and June 30, 2020 financial statements contains an explanatory paragraph expressing substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern, which contemplates that we will realize our assets and satisfy our liabilities and commitments in the ordinary course of business. We have suffered recurring losses from operations and have a working capital deficit. These factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS Our financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles applied on a consistent basis. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. We regularly evaluate the accounting policies and estimates that we use to prepare our financial statements. A complete summary of these policies is included in the notes to our financial statements. In general, management s estimates are based on historical experience, on information from third party professionals, and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the facts and circumstances. Actual results could differ from those estimates made by management. Management does not believe that any other recently issued, but not yet effective accounting pronouncements, if adopted, would have a material effect on the accompanying consolidated financial statements. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Not applicable. 17 Table of Contents ITEM 8.

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of June 30, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended June 30, 2021, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Going Concern The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 3 to the financial statements, the Company has not commenced operations or generated revenue to date. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. Management s plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 3. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.

F-6 Table of Contents TREX ACQUISITION CORP. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS June 30, 2021 NOTE 1 ORGANIZATION AND DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS TREX Acquisition Corp. (The Company was formed on January 16, 2008 in the state of Nevada under the name Plethora Resources, Inc. as a development stage enterprise. The Company was originally organized to engage in the business of consulting to oil and gas exploration companies interested in obtaining exploration and production licenses at auction for oil and gas properties in Russia. The Company later changed its name to Sync2 Networks Corp when the Company began to engage in software-related services. On March 20, 2014 to TREX Acquisition Corp. after the Company business operations had ceased. As of June 30, 2021, the Company consists of itself and its 100 owned subsidiary Sync2 Networks International Ltd. On April 7, 2014, our Board of Directors deemed it in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders to domesticate our subsidiary, Sync2 International Ltd., as a corporation formed under the laws of Malta to a corporation formed under the laws of the State of Nevada (the Domestication ), which under Nevada statutory law involves the transfer of an existing corporation from one jurisdiction to another whereby Sync2 Networks International Ltd. shall cease all operations in Malta. On May 1, 2014, we filed Articles of Domestication with the Nevada Secretary of State effecting the domestication of Sync2 International Ltd. as a corporate entity formed under the laws of the State of Nevada, which domestication provides that Sync2 International Ltd. as domesticated in the State of Nevada shall be the same entity as Sync2 International Ltd. organized under the laws of Malta. The Company s business plan is to find a merger candidate and become an operating company or to be a corporate governance and management company. 2020 TRXA Merger Sub Inc. On March 13, 2020, the Company incorporated a wholly owned subsidiary, TRXA Merger Sub Inc., a Delaware corporation Merger Sub in order to facilitate the acquisition of a pre-revenue Software-as-a-Service internet platform business. The Company s sole Officer and Director currently serves as the sole officer and director of the Merger Sub. As of the date of this filing, neither the Company nor the Merger Sub have entered into a definitive agreement or non-binding letter of intent to acquire a company. The Company s Acquisition Consultants continue to provide vetted candidates for merger with the Company. NOTE 2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Basis of Presentation The Company s financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America U.S. GAAP ). The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Management further acknowledges that it is solely responsible for adopting sound accounting practices, establishing and maintaining a system of internal accounting control and preventing and detecting fraud. The Company s system of internal accounting control is designed to assure, among other items, that 1) recorded transactions are valid; 2) valid transactions are recorded; and 3) transactions are recorded in the proper period in a timely manner to produce financial statements which present fairly the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the Company for the respective periods being presented F-7 Table of Contents Determination of Bad Debts The Company s policy is to analyze the collectability of Accounts and Notes Receivable on a monthly basis to determine whether any allowance for doubtful accounts is necessary. Once the allowance has been determined the offset is booked to bad debt expense and subsequently if the account is deemed to be a bad debt, it is written off the e allowance for doubtful accounts. Principles of Consolidation The accounts include those of the Company and its 100 owned subsidiary. All intercompany transactions have been eliminated. At this time, SYNC2 International LTD has no operations, assets or liabilities. On March 13, 2020, the Company incorporated a wholly owned subsidiary, TRXA Merger Sub Inc., a Delaware corporation Merger Sub in order to facilitate the acquisition of a pre-revenue Software-as-a-Service internet platform business. The Company s sole Officer and Director currently serves as the sole officer and director of the Merger Sub. As of the date of this filing, neither the Company nor the Merger Sub have entered into a definitive agreement or non-binding letter of intent to acquire a company. The Company s Acquisition Consultants continue to provide vetted candidates for merger with the Company. Use of estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Significant estimates include the estimated useful lives of property and equipment. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Cash equivalents The Company considers all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. Fair value of financial instruments The Company follows paragraph 825-10-50-10 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for disclosures about fair value of its financial instruments and paragraph 820-10-35-37 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification Paragraph 820-10-35-37 to measure the fair value of its financial instruments. Paragraph 820-10-35-37 establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S.) GAAP, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. To increase consistency and comparability in fair value measurements and related disclosures, Paragraph 820-10-35-37 establishes a fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three (3) broad levels. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. The three (3) levels of fair value hierarchy defined by Paragraph 820-10-35-37 are described below: Level 1 Quoted market prices available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date. Level 2 Pricing inputs other than quoted prices in active markets included in Level 1, which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting date. Level 3 Pricing inputs that are generally unobservable inputs and not corroborated by market data. The carrying amount of the Company s financial assets and liabilities, such as cash, and accrued expenses approximate their fair value because of the short maturity of those instruments. The Company s notes payable approximate the fair value of such instruments based upon management s best estimate of interest rates that would be available to the Company for similar financial arrangements at June 30, 2021. F-8 Table of Contents The assets and liabilities recorded on the balance sheet approximate their fair value. Equipment Equipment is recorded at cost. Expenditures for major additions and betterments are capitalized. Maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred. Depreciation of equipment is computed by the straight-line method (after taking into account their respective estimated residual values) over the assets estimated useful life of three (3) or seven (7) years. Upon sale or retirement of equipment, the related cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any gain or loss is reflected in statements of operations. Stock based compensation The Company accounts for stock-based compensation in accordance with ASC Section 718 Compensation Stock Compensation. Under the fair value recognition provisions of ASC 718 stock based compensation is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expensed ratably over the requisite service period/vesting period. The company accounts for its non-employee stock-based compensation in accordance with Update 2018-07 Compensation Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Nonemployee Share-Based Payment Accounting. Commitments and contingencies The Company follows subtopic 450-20 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification to report accounting for contingencies. Liabilities for loss contingencies arising from claims, assessments, litigation, fines and penalties and other sources are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the assessment can be reasonably estimated. Since June 30, 2021 and through the date of filing, there have been no intervening lawsuits, claims or judgments filed. Revenue recognition The Company recognizes revenue under ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), ASC 606 ). The core principle of the revenue standard is that a company should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The Company only applies the five-step model to contracts when it is probable that the Company will collect the consideration it is entitled to in exchange for the goods and services transferred to the customer. The following five steps are applied to achieve that core principle: Identify the contract with the customer Identify the performance obligations in the contract Determine the transaction price Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract Recognize revenue when the company satisfies a performance obligation Income taxes Federal Income taxes are not currently due since we have had losses since inception. Income taxes are provided based upon the liability method of accounting pursuant to ASC 740-10-25 Income Taxes Recognition. Under this approach, deferred income taxes are recorded to reflect the tax consequences in future years of differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts at each year-end. A valuation allowance is recorded against deferred tax assets if management does not believe the Company has met the more likely than not standard required by ASC 740-10-25-5. F-9 Table of Contents Deferred income tax amounts reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax reporting purposes. As of June 30, 2021, we had a net operating loss carry-forward of approximately (2,866,559) and a deferred tax asset of 601,977 using the statutory rate of 21 . The deferred tax asset may be recognized in future periods, not to exceed 20 years. However, due to the uncertainty of future events we have booked valuation allowance of (601,977). FASB ASC 740 prescribes recognition threshold and measurement attributes for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. FASB ASC 740 also provides guidance on de-recognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. At June 30, 2021, the Company had not taken any tax positions that would require disclosure under FASB ASC 740. June 30, 2021 June 30, 2020 Deferred Tax Asset 601,977 503,709 Valuation Allowance (601,977 (503,709 Deferred Tax Asset (Net) - - Due to the changes the Tax Reform Act of 1986 and the Tax Cut and Jobs Act of 2017, net operating loss carryforwards for Federal Income tax reporting purposes are subject to additional limitations. Should certain changes in ownership occur, our net operating loss carryforwards may be limited to use in future years. In addition, tax rates on corporations were reduced and certain other deductions limited. These changes may affect the income tax benefit calculation and related allowance during subsequent fiscal years Net income (loss) per common share Net income (loss) per common share is computed pursuant to section 260-10-45 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification. Basic net income (loss) per common share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted net income (loss) per common share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of shares of common stock and potentially outstanding shares of common stock during the period. The weighted average number of common shares outstanding and potentially outstanding common shares assumes that the Company incorporated as of the beginning of the first period presented. There were outstanding warrants that could convert into 187,500 shares of common stock as of June 30, 2021. At the end of both periods the potentially dilutive shares were excluded because the effect would have been anti-dilutive. Cash flows reporting The Company adopted paragraph 230-10-45-24 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for cash flows reporting, classifies cash receipts and payments according to whether they stem from operating, investing, or financing activities and provides definitions of each category, and uses the indirect or reconciliation method Indirect method as defined by paragraph 230-10-45-25 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification to report net cash flow from operating activities by adjusting net income to reconcile it to net cash flow from operating activities by removing the effects of (a) all deferrals of past operating cash receipts and payments and all accruals of expected future operating cash receipts and payments and (b) all items that are included in net income that do not affect operating cash receipts and payments. The Company reports the reporting currency equivalent of foreign currency cash flows, using the current exchange rate at the time of the cash flows and the effect of exchange rate changes on cash held in foreign currencies is reported as a separate item in the reconciliation of beginning and ending balances of cash and cash equivalents and separately provides information about investing and financing activities not resulting in cash receipts or payments in the period pursuant to paragraph 830-230-45-1 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification. F-10 Table of Contents Advertising Costs The Company expenses the cost of advertising and promotional materials when incurred. Total Advertising costs were zero for all periods. Subsequent events The Company follows the guidance in Section 855-10-50 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for the disclosure of subsequent events. The Company will evaluate subsequent events through the date when the financial statements were issued. Pursuant to ASU 2010-09 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification, the Company as an SEC filer, considers its financial statements issued when they are widely distributed to users, such as through filing them on EDGAR. NOTE 3 GOING CONCERN As reflected in the accompanying financial statements, the Company had an accumulated deficit of 2,866,559 and a working capital deficit of 46,124 as of June 30, 2021. While the Company is attempting to commence operations and generate revenues, the Company s cash position may not be significant enough to support the Company s daily operations. Management intends to raise additional funds by way of a public or private offering. Management believes that the actions presently being taken to further implement its business plan and generate revenues provide the opportunity for the Company to continue as a going concern. While the Company believes in the viability of its strategy to generate revenues and in its ability to raise additional funds, there can be no assurances to that effect and there is substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the Company s ability to further implement its business plan and generate revenues. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.

F-19 Table of Contents TREX ACQUISITION CORP. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited) September 30, 2020 NOTE 1 ORGANIZATION AND DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS TREX Acquisition Corp. (The Company was formed on January 16, 2008 in the state of Nevada under the name Plethora Resources, Inc. as a development stage enterprise. The Company later changed its name to Sync2 Networks Corp. then on March 20, 2014 to T-REX Acquisition Corp. The Company was originally organized to engage in the business of consulting to oil and gas exploration companies interested in obtaining exploration and production licenses at auction for oil and gas properties in Russia. The Company consists of itself and its 100 owned subsidiary Sync2 Networks International Ltd. On April 7, 2014, our Board of Directors deemed it in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders to domesticate our subsidiary, Sync2 International Ltd., as a corporation formed under the laws of Malta to a corporation formed under the laws of the State of Nevada (the Domestication ), which under Nevada statutory law involves the transfer of an existing corporation from one jurisdiction to another whereby Sync2 Networks International Ltd. shall cease all operations in Malta. On May 1, 2014, we filed Articles of Domestication with the Nevada Secretary of State effecting the domestication of Sync2 International Ltd. as a corporate entity formed under the laws of the State of Nevada, which domestication provides that Sync2 International Ltd. as domesticated in the State of Nevada shall be the same entity as Sync2 International Ltd. organized under the laws of Malta. The Company s business plan is to find a merger candidate and become an operating company or to be a corporate governance and management company. NOTE 2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Basis of Presentation Certain information and note disclosures normally included in our annual financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted account principles have been condensed or omitted. These consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with a reading of the financial statements and notes there included in our annual report on form 10k for the fiscal year end June 30, 2020, as filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission. The Company s financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America U.S. GAAP ). The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Management further acknowledges that it is solely responsible for adopting sound accounting practices, establishing and maintaining a system of internal accounting control and preventing and detecting fraud. The Company s system of internal accounting control is designed to assure, among other items, that 1) recorded transactions are valid; 2) valid transactions are recorded; and 3) transactions are recorded in the proper period in a timely manner to produce financial statements which present fairly the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the Company for the respective periods being presented Determination of Bad Debts The Company s policy is to analyze the collectability of Accounts and Notes Receivable on a monthly basis to determine whether any allowance for doubtful accounts is necessary. Once the allowance has been determined the offset is booked to bad debt expense and subsequently if the account is deemed to be a bad debt, it is written off the allowance for doubtful accounts. F-20 Table of Contents Principles of Consolidation The accounts include those of the Company and its 100 owned subsidiary. All intercompany transactions have been eliminated. At this time, SYNC2 International LTD has no operations, assets or liabilities. Use of estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Significant estimates include the estimated useful lives of property and equipment. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Cash equivalents The Company considers all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. Fair value of financial instruments The Company follows paragraph 825-10-50-10 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for disclosures about fair value of its financial instruments and paragraph 820-10-35-37 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification Paragraph 820-10-35-37 to measure the fair value of its financial instruments. Paragraph 820-10-35-37 establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S.) GAAP, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. To increase consistency and comparability in fair value measurements and related disclosures, Paragraph 820-10-35-37 establishes a fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three (3) broad levels. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. The three (3) levels of fair value hierarchy defined by Paragraph 820-10-35-37 are described below: Level 1 Quoted market prices available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date. Level 2 Pricing inputs other than quoted prices in active markets included in Level 1, which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting date. Level 3 Pricing inputs that are generally unobservable inputs and not corroborated by market data. The carrying amount of the Company s financial assets and liabilities, such as cash, and accrued expenses approximate their fair value because of the short maturity of those instruments. The Company s notes payable approximates the fair value of such instruments based upon management s best estimate of interest rates that would be available to the Company for similar financial arrangements at September 30, 2020. The assets and liabilities recorded on the balance sheet approximate their fair value. Equipment Equipment is recorded at cost. Expenditures for major additions and betterments are capitalized. Maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred. Depreciation of equipment is computed by the straight-line method (after taking into account their respective estimated residual values) over the assets estimated useful life of three (3) or seven (7) years. Upon sale or retirement of equipment, the related cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any gain or loss is reflected in statements of operations. F-21 Table of Contents Impairment of long-lived assets The Company follows paragraph 360-10-05-4 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for its long-lived assets. The Company s long-lived assets, which includes computer equipment is reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. The Company assesses the recoverability of its long-lived assets by comparing the projected undiscounted net cash flows associated with the related long-lived asset or group of long-lived assets over their remaining estimated useful lives against their respective carrying amounts. Impairment, if any, is based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of those assets. Fair value is generally determined using the asset s expected future discounted cash flows or market value, if readily determinable. If long-lived assets are determined to be recoverable, but the newly determined remaining estimated useful lives are shorter than originally estimated, the net book values of the long-lived assets are depreciated over the newly determined remaining estimated useful lives. The Company determined that there were no impairments of long-lived assets as of September 30, 2020 or June 30, 2020 Stock based compensations The Company accounts for stock-based compensation in accordance with ASC Section 718 Compensation Stock Compensation. Under the fair value recognition provisions of ASC 718 stock-based compensation is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expensed ratably over the requisite service period/vesting period. The company accounts for its non-employee stock-based compensation in accordance with Update 2018-07 Compensation Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Nonemployee Share-Based Payment Accounting. Commitments and contingencies The Company follows subtopic 450-20 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification to report accounting for contingencies. Liabilities for loss contingencies arising from claims, assessments, litigation, fines and penalties and other sources are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the assessment can be reasonably estimated. Since September 30, 2020 and through the date of filing, there have been no intervening lawsuits, claims or judgments filed. Revenue recognition The Company recognizes revenue under ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), ASC 606 ). The core principle of the revenue standard is that a company should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The Company only applies the five-step model to contracts when it is probable that the Company will collect the consideration it is entitled to in exchange for the goods and services transferred to the customer. The following five steps are applied to achieve that core principle: Identify the contract with the customer Identify the performance obligations in the contract Determine the transaction price Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract Recognize revenue when the company satisfies a performance obligation F-22 Table of Contents Net income (loss) per common share Net income (loss) per common share is computed pursuant to section 260-10-45 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification. Basic net income (loss) per common share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted net income (loss) per common share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of shares of common stock and potentially outstanding shares of common stock during the period. The weighted average number of common shares outstanding and potentially outstanding common shares assumes that the Company incorporated as of the beginning of the first period presented. There were outstanding warrants that could convert into 187,500 shares of common stock as of September 30, 2020. At the end of both periods the potentially dilutive shares were excluded because the effect would have been anti-dilutive. Cash flows reporting The Company adopted paragraph 230-10-45-24 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for cash flows reporting, classifies cash receipts and payments according to whether they stem from operating, investing, or financing activities and provides definitions of each category, and uses the indirect or reconciliation method Indirect method as defined by paragraph 230-10-45-25 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification to report net cash flow from operating activities by adjusting net income to reconcile it to net cash flow from operating activities by removing the effects of (a) all deferrals of past operating cash receipts and payments and all accruals of expected future operating cash receipts and payments and (b) all items that are included in net income that do not affect operating cash receipts and payments. The Company reports the reporting currency equivalent of foreign currency cash flows, using the current exchange rate at the time of the cash flows and the effect of exchange rate changes on cash held in foreign currencies is reported as a separate item in the reconciliation of beginning and ending balances of cash and cash equivalents and separately provides information about investing and financing activities not resulting in cash receipts or payments in the period pursuant to paragraph 830-230-45-1 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification. Advertising Costs The Company expenses the cost of advertising and promotional materials when incurred. Total Advertising costs were zero for all periods. Subsequent events The Company follows the guidance in Section 855-10-50 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for the disclosure of subsequent events. The Company will evaluate subsequent events through the date when the financial statements were issued. Pursuant to ASU 2010-09 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification, the Company as an SEC filer, considers its financial statements issued when they are widely distributed to users, such as through filing them on EDGAR. NOTE 3 GOING CONCERN As reflected in the accompanying financial statements, the Company had an accumulated deficit of 2,735,155 and a working capital deficit of 39,766 as of September 30, 2020. While the Company is attempting to commence operations and generate revenues, the Company s cash position may not be significant enough to support the Company s daily operations. Management intends to raise additional funds by way of a public or private offering. Management believes that the actions presently being taken to further implement its business plan and generate revenues provide the opportunity for the Company to continue as a going concern. While the Company believes in the viability of its strategy to generate revenues and in its ability to raise additional funds, there can be no assurances to that effect and there is substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the Company s ability to further implement its business plan and generate revenues. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.

F-31 Table of Contents TREX ACQUISITION CORP. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited) December 31, 2020 NOTE 1 ORGANIZATION AND DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS TREX Acquisition Corp. (The Company was formed on January 16, 2008 in the state of Nevada under the name Plethora Resources, Inc. as a development stage enterprise. The Company later changed its name to Sync2 Networks Corp. then on March 20, 2014 to T-REX Acquisition Corp. The Company was originally organized to engage in the business of consulting to oil and gas exploration companies interested in obtaining exploration and production licenses at auction for oil and gas properties in Russia. The Company consists of itself and its 100 owned subsidiary Sync2 Networks International Ltd. On April 7, 2014, our Board of Directors deemed it in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders to domesticate our subsidiary, Sync2 International Ltd., as a corporation formed under the laws of Malta to a corporation formed under the laws of the State of Nevada (the Domestication ), which under Nevada statutory law involves the transfer of an existing corporation from one jurisdiction to another whereby Sync2 Networks International Ltd. shall cease all operations in Malta. On May 1, 2014, we filed Articles of Domestication with the Nevada Secretary of State effecting the domestication of Sync2 International Ltd. as a corporate entity formed under the laws of the State of Nevada, which domestication provides that Sync2 International Ltd. as domesticated in the State of Nevada shall be the same entity as Sync2 International Ltd. organized under the laws of Malta. The Company s business plan is to find a merger candidate and become an operating company or to be a corporate governance and management company. NOTE 2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Basis of Presentation Certain information and note disclosures normally included in our annual financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted account principles have been condensed or omitted. These consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with a reading of the financial statements and notes there included in our annual report on form 10k for the fiscal year end June 30, 2020, as filed with this form 10K. The Company s financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America U.S. GAAP ). The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Management further acknowledges that it is solely responsible for adopting sound accounting practices, establishing and maintaining a system of internal accounting control and preventing and detecting fraud. The Company s system of internal accounting control is designed to assure, among other items, that 1) recorded transactions are valid; 2) valid transactions are recorded; and 3) transactions are recorded in the proper period in a timely manner to produce financial statements which present fairly the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the Company for the respective periods being presented Determination of Bad Debts The Company s policy is to analyze the collectability of Accounts and Notes Receivable on a monthly basis to determine whether any allowance for doubtful accounts is necessary. Once the allowance has been determined the offset is booked to bad debt expense and subsequently if the account is deemed to be a bad debt, it is written off the allowance for doubtful accounts. F-32 Table of Contents Principles of Consolidation The accounts include those of the Company and its 100 owned subsidiary. All intercompany transactions have been eliminated. At this time, SYNC2 International LTD has no operations, assets or liabilities. Use of estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Significant estimates include the estimated useful lives of property and equipment. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Cash equivalents The Company considers all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. Fair value of financial instruments The Company follows paragraph 825-10-50-10 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for disclosures about fair value of its financial instruments and paragraph 820-10-35-37 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification Paragraph 820-10-35-37 to measure the fair value of its financial instruments. Paragraph 820-10-35-37 establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S.) GAAP and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. To increase consistency and comparability in fair value measurements and related disclosures, Paragraph 820-10-35-37 establishes a fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three (3) broad levels. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. The three (3) levels of fair value hierarchy defined by Paragraph 820-10-35-37 are described below: Level 1 Quoted market prices available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date. Level 2 Pricing inputs other than quoted prices in active markets included in Level 1, which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting date. Level 3 Pricing inputs that are generally unobservable inputs and not corroborated by market data. The carrying amount of the Company s financial assets and liabilities, such as cash, and accrued expenses approximate their fair value because of the short maturity of those instruments. The Company s notes payable approximate the fair value of such instruments based upon management s best estimate of interest rates that would be available to the Company for similar financial arrangements at December 31, 2020. The Company does not have any assets or liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring or a non-recurring basis. Equipment Equipment is recorded at cost. Expenditures for major additions and betterments are capitalized. Maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred. Depreciation of equipment is computed by the straight-line method (after taking into account their respective estimated residual values) over the assets estimated useful life of three (3) or seven (7) years. Upon sale or retirement of equipment, the related cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any gain or loss is reflected in statements of operations. F-33 Table of Contents Stock based compensation The Company accounts for stock-based compensation in accordance with ASC Section 718 Compensation Stock Compensation. Under the fair value recognition provisions of ASC 718 stock-based compensation is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expensed ratably over the requisite service period/vesting period. The company accounts for its non-employee stock-based compensation in accordance with Update 2018-07 Compensation Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Nonemployee Share-Based Payment Accounting. Commitments and contingencies The Company follows subtopic 450-20 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification to report accounting for contingencies. Liabilities for loss contingencies arising from claims, assessments, litigation, fines and penalties and other sources are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the assessment can be reasonably estimated. Since December 31, 2020, and through the date of filing, there have been no intervening lawsuits, claims or judgments filed. Revenue recognition The Company recognizes revenue under ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), ASC 606 ). The core principle of the revenue standard is that a company should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The Company only applies the five-step model to contracts when it is probable that the Company will collect the consideration it is entitled to in exchange for the goods and services transferred to the customer. The following five steps are applied to achieve that core principle: Identify the contract with the customer Identify the performance obligations in the contract Determine the transaction price Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract Recognize revenue when the company satisfies a performance obligation Net income (loss) per common share Net income (loss) per common share is computed pursuant to section 260-10-45 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification. Basic net income (loss) per common share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted net income (loss) per common share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of shares of common stock and potentially outstanding shares of common stock during the period. The weighted average number of common shares outstanding and potentially outstanding common shares assumes that the Company incorporated as of the beginning of the first period presented. There were outstanding warrants that could convert into 187,500 shares of common stock as of December 31, 2020. At the end of both periods the potentially dilutive shares were excluded because the effect would have been anti-dilutive. F-34 Table of Contents Cash flows reporting The Company adopted paragraph 230-10-45-24 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for cash flows reporting, classifies cash receipts and payments according to whether they stem from operating, investing, or financing activities and provides definitions of each category, and uses the indirect or reconciliation method Indirect method as defined by paragraph 230-10-45-25 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification to report net cash flow from operating activities by adjusting net income to reconcile it to net cash flow from operating activities by removing the effects of (a) all deferrals of past operating cash receipts and payments and all accruals of expected future operating cash receipts and payments and (b) all items that are included in net income that do not affect operating cash receipts and payments. The Company reports the reporting currency equivalent of foreign currency cash flows, using the current exchange rate at the time of the cash flows and the effect of exchange rate changes on cash held in foreign currencies is reported as a separate item in the reconciliation of beginning and ending balances of cash and cash equivalents and separately provides information about investing and financing activities not resulting in cash receipts or payments in the period pursuant to paragraph 830-230-45-1 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification. Advertising Costs The Company expenses the cost of advertising and promotional materials when incurred. Total Advertising costs were zero for all periods. Subsequent events The Company follows the guidance in Section 855-10-50 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for the disclosure of subsequent events. The Company will evaluate subsequent events through the date when the financial statements were issued. Pursuant to ASU 2010-09 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification, the Company as an SEC filer, considers its financial statements issued when they are widely distributed to users, such as through filing them on EDGAR. NOTE 3 GOING CONCERN As reflected in the accompanying financial statements, the Company had an accumulated deficit of 2,776,634 and a working capital deficit of 1,072 at December 31, 2020. While the Company is attempting to commence operations and generate revenues, the Company s cash position may not be significant enough to support the Company s daily operations. Management intends to raise additional funds by way of a public or private offering. Management believes that the actions presently being taken to further implement its business plan and generate revenues provide the opportunity for the Company to continue as a going concern. While the Company believes in the viability of its strategy to generate revenues and in its ability to raise additional funds, there can be no assurances to that effect and there is substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the Company s ability to further implement its business plan and generate revenues. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.

F-43 Table of Contents TREX ACQUISITION CORP. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited) March 31, 2021 NOTE 1 ORGANIZATION AND DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS TREX Acquisition Corp. (The Company was formed on January 16, 2008 in the state of Nevada under the name Plethora Resources, Inc. as a development stage enterprise. The Company later changed its name to Sync2 Networks Corp. then on March 20, 2014 to T-REX Acquisition Corp. The Company was originally organized to engage in the business of consulting to oil and gas exploration companies interested in obtaining exploration and production licenses at auction for oil and gas properties in Russia. The Company consists of itself and its 100 owned subsidiary Sync2 Networks International Ltd. On April 7, 2014, our Board of Directors deemed it in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders to domesticate our subsidiary, Sync2 International Ltd., as a corporation formed under the laws of Malta to a corporation formed under the laws of the State of Nevada (the Domestication ), which under Nevada statutory law involves the transfer of an existing corporation from one jurisdiction to another whereby Sync2 Networks International Ltd. shall cease all operations in Malta. On May 1, 2014, we filed Articles of Domestication with the Nevada Secretary of State effecting the domestication of Sync2 International Ltd. as a corporate entity formed under the laws of the State of Nevada, which domestication provides that Sync2 International Ltd. as domesticated in the State of Nevada shall be the same entity as Sync2 International Ltd. organized under the laws of Malta. The Company s business plan is to find a merger candidate and become an operating company or to be a corporate governance and management company. 2020 TRXA Merger Sub Inc. On March 13, 2020, the Company incorporated a wholly owned subsidiary, TRXA Merger Sub Inc., a Delaware corporation Merger Sub in order to facilitate the acquisition of a pre-revenue Software-as-a-Service internet platform business. The Company s sole Officer and Director currently serves as the sole officer and director of the Merger Sub. As of the date of this filing, neither the Company nor the Merger Sub have entered into a definitive agreement or non-binding letter of intent to acquire a company. The Company s Acquisition Consultants continue to provide vetted candidates for merger with the Company. NOTE 2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Basis of Presentation Certain information and note disclosures normally included in our annual financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted account principles have been condensed or omitted. These consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with a reading of the financial statements and notes there included in our annual report on form 10k for the fiscal year end June 30, 2020, as filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission. The Company s financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America U.S. GAAP ). The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Management further acknowledges that it is solely responsible for adopting sound accounting practices, establishing and maintaining a system of internal accounting control and preventing and detecting fraud. The Company s system of internal accounting control is designed to assure, among other items, that 1) recorded transactions are valid; 2) valid transactions are recorded; and 3) transactions are recorded in the proper period in a timely manner to produce financial statements which present fairly the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the Company for the respective periods being presented F-44 Table of Contents Determination of Bad Debts The Company s policy is to analyze the collectability of Accounts and Notes Receivable on a monthly basis to determine whether any allowance for doubtful accounts is necessary. Once the allowance has been determined the offset is booked to bad debt expense and subsequently if the account is deemed to be a bad debt, it is written off the allowance for doubtful accounts. Principles of Consolidation The accounts include those of the Company and its 100 owned subsidiary. All intercompany transactions have been eliminated. At this time, SYNC2 International LTD has no operations, assets or liabilities. 2020 TRXA Merger Sub Inc. On March 13, 2020, the Company incorporated a wholly owned subsidiary, TRXA Merger Sub Inc., a Delaware corporation Merger Sub in order to facilitate the acquisition of a pre-revenue Software-as-a-Service internet platform business. The Company s sole Officer and Director currently serves as the sole officer and director of the Merger Sub. As of the date of this filing, neither the Company nor the Merger Sub have entered into a definitive agreement or non-binding letter of intent to acquire a company. The Company s Acquisition Consultants continue to provide vetted candidates for merger with the Company. Use of estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Significant estimates include the estimated useful lives of property and equipment. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Cash equivalents The Company considers all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. Fair value of financial instruments The Company follows paragraph 825-10-50-10 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for disclosures about fair value of its financial instruments and paragraph 820-10-35-37 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification Paragraph 820-10-35-37 to measure the fair value of its financial instruments. Paragraph 820-10-35-37 establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S.) GAAP, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. To increase consistency and comparability in fair value measurements and related disclosures, Paragraph 820-10-35-37 establishes a fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three (3) broad levels. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. The three (3) levels of fair value hierarchy defined by Paragraph 820-10-35-37 are described below: Level 1 Quoted market prices available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date. Level 2 Pricing inputs other than quoted prices in active markets included in Level 1, which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting date. Level 3 Pricing inputs that are generally unobservable inputs and not corroborated by market data. F-45 Table of Contents The carrying amount of the Company s financial assets and liabilities, such as cash, and accrued expenses approximate their fair value because of the short maturity of those instruments. The Company s notes payable approximate the fair value of such instruments based upon management s best estimate of interest rates that would be available to the Company for similar financial arrangements at March 31, 2021. The Company does not have any assets or liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring or a non-recurring basis. Equipment Equipment is recorded at cost. Expenditures for major additions and betterments are capitalized. Maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred. Depreciation of equipment is computed by the straight-line method (after taking into account their respective estimated residual values) over the assets estimated useful life of three (3) or seven (7) years. Upon sale or retirement of equipment, the related cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any gain or loss is reflected in statements of operations. Stock based compensation The Company accounts for stock-based compensation in accordance with ASC Section 718 Compensation Stock Compensation. Under the fair value recognition provisions of ASC 718 stock-based compensation is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expensed ratably over the requisite service period/vesting period. The company accounts for its non-employee stock-based compensation in accordance with Update 2018-07 Compensation Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Nonemployee Share-Based Payment Accounting. Commitments and contingencies The Company follows subtopic 450-20 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification to report accounting for contingencies. Liabilities for loss contingencies arising from claims, assessments, litigation, fines and penalties and other sources are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the assessment can be reasonably estimated. Since March 31, 2021 and through the date of filing, there have been no intervening lawsuits, claims or judgments filed. Revenue recognition The Company recognizes revenue under ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), ASC 606 ). The core principle of the revenue standard is that a company should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The Company only applies the five-step model to contracts when it is probable that the Company will collect the consideration it is entitled to in exchange for the goods and services transferred to the customer. The following five steps are applied to achieve that core principle: Identify the contract with the customer Identify the performance obligations in the contract Determine the transaction price Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract Recognize revenue when the company satisfies a performance obligation F-46 Table of Contents Net income (loss) per common share Net income (loss) per common share is computed pursuant to section 260-10-45 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification. Basic net income (loss) per common share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted net income (loss) per common share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of shares of common stock and potentially outstanding shares of common stock during the period. The weighted average number of common shares outstanding and potentially outstanding common shares assumes that the Company incorporated as of the beginning of the first period presented. Cash flows reporting The Company adopted paragraph 230-10-45-24 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for cash flows reporting, classifies cash receipts and payments according to whether they stem from operating, investing, or financing activities and provides definitions of each category, and uses the indirect or reconciliation method Indirect method as defined by paragraph 230-10-45-25 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification to report net cash flow from operating activities by adjusting net income to reconcile it to net cash flow from operating activities by removing the effects of (a) all deferrals of past operating cash receipts and payments and all accruals of expected future operating cash receipts and payments and (b) all items that are included in net income that do not affect operating cash receipts and payments. The Company reports the reporting currency equivalent of foreign currency cash flows, using the current exchange rate at the time of the cash flows and the effect of exchange rate changes on cash held in foreign currencies is reported as a separate item in the reconciliation of beginning and ending balances of cash and cash equivalents and separately provides information about investing and financing activities not resulting in cash receipts or payments in the period pursuant to paragraph 830-230-45-1 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification. Advertising Costs The Company expenses the cost of advertising and promotional materials when incurred. Total Advertising costs were zero for all periods. Subsequent events The Company follows the guidance in Section 855-10-50 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for the disclosure of subsequent events. The Company will evaluate subsequent events through the date when the financial statements were issued. Pursuant to ASU 2010-09 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification, the Company as an SEC filer, considers its financial statements issued when they are widely distributed to users, such as through filing them on EDGAR. NOTE 3 GOING CONCERN As reflected in the accompanying financial statements, the Company had an accumulated deficit of 2,820,535 and a working capital deficit of 100 as of March 31, 2021. While the Company is attempting to commence operations and generate revenues, the Company s cash position may not be significant enough to support the Company s daily operations. Management intends to raise additional funds by way of a public or private offering. Management believes that the actions presently being taken to further implement its business plan and generate revenues provide the opportunity for the Company to continue as a going concern. While the Company believes in the viability of its strategy to generate revenues and in its ability to raise additional funds, there can be no assurances to that effect and there is substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the Company s ability to further implement its business plan and generate revenues. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.

CHANGES AND DISAGREEMENT WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE As of the date of this filing, there are no disagreements between us and our accountants on any matter of accounting principles, practices or financial statement disclosure. ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES EVALUATION OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES We maintain controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management including our principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. Based upon their evaluation of those controls and procedures performed as of the end of the periods covered by this report, our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective. MANAGEMENT S ANNUAL REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING Our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer are responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, our principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by our Board of Directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that: Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and our directors; and Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, our internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2021. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the 1992 Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission 2013 COSO in Internal Control Integrated Framework. Based on our assessment, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer believe that, as of June 30, 2021, our internal control over financial reporting is not effective based on those criteria, due to the following: Deficiencies in Segregation of Duties. Lack of proper segregation of functions, duties and responsibilities with respect to our cash and control over the disbursements related thereto due to our very limited staff, including our accounting personnel. Deficiencies in the staffing of our financial accounting department. The number of qualified accounting personnel with experience in public company SEC reporting and GAAP is limited. This weakness does not enable us to maintain adequate controls over our financial accounting and reporting processes regarding the accounting for non-routine and non-systematic transactions. There is a risk that a material misstatement of the financial statements could be caused, or at least not be detected in a timely manner, by this shortage of qualified resources. In light of this conclusion and as part of the preparation of this report, we have applied compensating procedures and processes as necessary to ensure the reliability of our financial reporting. Accordingly, management believes, based on its knowledge, that (1) this report does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material face necessary to make the statements made not misleading with respect to the periods covered by this report, and (2) the financial statements, and other financial information included in this report, fairly present in all material respects our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows for the years and periods then ended. This report does not include an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management s report was not subject to attestation by our registered public accounting firm pursuant to the rules of the SEC that permit us to provide only management s report in this report. CHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING There were no significant changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the fourth quarter of the year ended June 30, 2021, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

During the past forty years, Mr. Horkey has been engaged as an auditor and a certified public accountant. Mr. Horkey currently is the founder and manager of Horkey Associates, which is a public accounting firm located in West Broward, Florida. In 1978, Mr. Horkey commenced his career with Touche Ross (which is now called Deloitte Touche), an international public accounting firm, in Miami, Florida. After three years, he started his own public accounting firm and through subsequent mergers was a partner through 1991 in one of the largest accounting firms in western Broward County. Mr. Horkey has taught courses on accounting, auditing and taxation issues, and has written a variety of articles on diverse tax topics, such as home office deductions, and accounting and auditing topics such as audits of small businesses. Mr. Horkey s clients have included large corporations, small businesses, professionals, not-for-profit organizations, municipalities and other governmental entities. Mr. Horkey was the audit partner on one of the pilot single audits performed on a large governmental unit in 1981, and was involved in the development and application of the single audit process with the Office of Management and Budget and the General Accounting Office. Mr. Horkey earned a Bachelor of Science in Accounting from Florida Atlantic University and has been certified by the State of Florida as a Certified Public Accountant since April 1979. He is a member of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants as well as the Florida Institute of Certified Public Accountants. He also holds the designation as Certified in Florida Sales Tax, a specialty designation awarded jointly by the Florida Board of Accountancy and the Florida Institute of Certified Public Accountants. Mr. Horkey is also a 1993 graduate of Leadership Broward and 1987 President of the Sunrise Chamber of Commerce. He has been a member of the Broward Workforce Development Board since 1993 and Chair of its Audit Committee and was Board Chair for 2015-2016. Mr. Horkey is the 1995 recipient of the Small Business Person of the Year award from the Sunrise Chamber of Commerce, and a two-time finalist for the South Florida Up and Comers Award in accounting. He was also Chair of the Sole Practitioners Committee of the Florida Institute of Certified Public Accountants for two years. Mr. Horkey s community involvement also extends into the education environment. He was a member of the School Board of Broward County Audit Committee for ten years, Chair of the Sunrise Chamber of Commerce Education Committee for three years, and co-founder of the Sunrise Chamber One for the Kids Program (which matches business people who have specific skills with schools and/or students with matching needs). He also worked on the Broward Education Planning Initiative, which was the first countywide effort to address school overcrowding. Mr. Horkey was Treasurer of Broward Education Foundation for four years including the period during which the Foundation administered the Marjory Stoneman Douglas Victims fund of over 10,700,000. He is currently Board Chair of Broward Education Foundation. All directors hold office until the completion of their term of office, which is not longer than one year, or until their successors have been elected. All officers are appointed annually by the board of directors and, subject to employment agreements (which do not currently exist), serve at the discretion of the board. Currently, our directors receive no compensation. There is no family relationship between any of our officers or directors. For the past ten years, there have been no orders, judgments, or decrees of any governmental agency or administrator, or of any court of competent jurisdiction, revoking or suspending for cause any license, permit or other authority to engage in the securities business or in the sale of a particular security or temporarily or permanently restraining any of our officers or directors from engaging in or continuing any conduct, practice or employment in connection with the purchase or sale of securities, or convicting such person of any felony or misdemeanor involving a security, or any aspect of the securities business or of theft or of any felony. 19 Table of Contents CORPORATE GOVERNANCE Committees Our Board of Directors does not currently have a compensation committee or nominating and corporate governance committee because, due to the Board of Director s composition and our relatively limited operations, the Board of Directors believes it is able to effectively manage the issues normally considered by such committees. Our Board of Directors may undertake a review of the need for these committees in the future. Audit Committee and Financial Expert Our Board of Directors has not established an audit committee. The respective role of an audit committee has been conducted by our Board of Directors. We intend to establish an audit committee as soon as it is practical to do so.. When established, the audit committee s primary function will be to provide advice with respect to our financial matters and to assist our Board of Directors in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities regarding finance, accounting, and legal compliance. The audit committee s primary duties and responsibilities will be to: (i) serve as an independent and objective party to monitor our financial reporting process and internal control system; (ii) review and appraise the audit efforts of our independent accountants; (iii) evaluate our quarterly financial performance as well as its compliance with laws and regulations; (iv) oversee management s establishment and enforcement of financial policies and business practices; and (v) provide an open avenue of communication among the independent accountants, management and our Board of Directors. Code of Ethics We do not currently have a Code of Ethics that applies to all employees, including our principal executive officer, principal financial officer, principal accounting officer or controller, or persons performing similar functions. We plan to adopt a Code of Ethics. Director Independence Our director is not deemed independent. Our director also holds positions as an officer. ITEM 11.
