due to various factors, including, but not limited to our:

 to complete our initial business combination; 

success
 in retaining or recruiting, or changes required in, our officers, key employees or directors
 following an initial business combination;

 and directors allocating their time to other businesses and potentially having conflicts
 of interest with our business or in approving our initial business combination, as a result
 of which they would then receive expense reimbursements; 

potential
 ability to obtain additional financing to complete an initial business combination; 

pool
 of prospective target businesses; 

failure
 to maintain the listing on, or the delisting of our securities from, Nasdaq or an inability
 to have our securities listed on Nasdaq or another national securities exchange following

potential
 change in control if we acquire one or more target businesses for stock;

whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as may be required under applicable securities laws. These
risks and others described under Risk Factors may not be exhaustive.

Cautionary
Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements 

All
statements other than statements of historical fact included in this Report including, without limitation, statements under this Management s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations regarding our financial position, business strategy and
the plans and objectives of management for future operations, are forward- looking statements. When used in this Report, words such as
 anticipate, believe, estimate, expect, intend and similar expressions,
as they relate to us or our management, identify forward-looking statements. Such forward-looking statements are based on the beliefs
of management, as well as assumptions made by, and information currently available to, the Company s management. Actual results
could differ materially from those contemplated by the forward- looking statements as a result of certain factors detailed in our filings
with the SEC. All subsequent written or oral forward-looking statements attributable to us or persons acting on our behalf are qualified
in their entirety by this paragraph. 

The
following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the financial
statements and the notes thereto contained elsewhere in this Report. Certain information contained in the discussion and analysis set
forth below includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. 

Overview 

We
are a blank check company incorporated on February 23, 2021, as a Cayman Islands exempted company and for the purpose of effecting a
merger, amalgamation, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more
businesses or entities. We intend to effectuate our initial business combination using cash from the proceeds of our initial public offering
and our private placement of private placement warrants. 

Our
sponsor is Gesher I Sponsor LLC, a Delaware limited liability company. The registration statement for our initial public offering was
declared effective on October 12, 2021. On October 14, 2021, we consummated our initial public offering of 10,000,000 units at 10.00
per unit, with each unit consisting of one ordinary share and one-half of one warrant, with each whole warrant entitling the holder thereof
to purchase one ordinary share at a price of 11.50 per share. 

Simultaneously
with the consummation of the initial public offering, we consummated the private placement of 4,550,000 warrants at a price of 1.00
per warrant in a private placement, generating gross proceeds of 4,550,000. 

Following
the closing of the initial public offering on October 14, 2021, 101,000,000 10.10 per unit) from the net proceeds of the sale of the
units in the initial public offering and the private placement was deposited into a trust account, invested in United States government
securities within the meaning of Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act with a maturity of 180 days or less or in money
market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company Act which invest only in direct U.S.
government treasury obligations. Except with respect to interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account that may be released to
us to pay our income or other tax obligations as described in the initial public offering, the proceeds will not be released from the
trust account until the earlier of the completion of a business combination or the redemption of 100 of the outstanding public shares
if we have not completed a business combination within the time required time period. 

4 

We
have until April 14, 2023 (18 months from the closing of the initial public offering) to complete the initial business combination. If
we do not consummate an initial business combination by such date, we will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding
up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem 100 of the outstanding public shares,
at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including any interest not
previously released to us but net of taxes payable (and less up to 50,000 of interest to pay liquidation expenses), divided by the number
of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public shareholders rights as shareholders (including
the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible
following such redemption, subject to the approval of the remaining shareholders and the board of directors, dissolve and liquidate,
subject (in the case of (ii) and (iii) above) to our obligations under Cayman Islands law to provide for claims of creditors and the
requirements of other applicable law. 

We
expect to continue to incur significant costs in the pursuit of our acquisition plans. We cannot assure you that our plans to raise capital
or to complete our initial business combination will be successful. 

Results
of Operations 

As
of September 30, 2021, we have neither engaged in any operations nor generated any revenues. All activity for the period from February
23, 2021 (inception) through September 30, 2021 relates to our formation and the initial public offering. We will not generate any operating
revenues until after the completion of our initial business combination, at the earliest. We will generate non-operating income in the
form of interest income on cash and cash equivalents from the proceeds derived from the initial public offering. 

For
the period from February 23, 2021 (inception) through September 30, 2021, we had a net loss of 14,946, which was resulted entirely from
formation and operating costs. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

As
of September 30, 2021, we had no cash and working deficit of 198,145 (excluding deferred offering costs). 

Our
liquidity needs up to September 30, 2021 had been satisfied through a payment from the sponsor of 25,000 for the founder shares to cover
certain offering costs, and the loan under an unsecured promissory note from the sponsor of 175,827. The promissory note was paid in
full on October 18, 2021. 

Subsequent
to the period covered by this Annual Report, we consummated the initial public offering and private placement. Of the net proceeds from
the initial public offering and associated private placements, 101,000,000 of cash was placed in the trust account and 1,151,222 of
cash was held outside of the trust account and is available for our working capital purposes. 

In
addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with a business combination, the sponsor, initial shareholders, officers,
directors or their affiliates may, but are not obligated to, provide us working capital loans. As of September 30, 2021, there were no
amounts outstanding under any working capital loans. 

Based
on the foregoing, management believes that we will have sufficient working capital and borrowing capacity to meet our needs through the
earlier of the consummation of a business combination or one year from this filing. Over this time period, we will be using these funds
for paying existing accounts payable, identifying and evaluating prospective initial business combination candidates, performing due
diligence on prospective target businesses, paying for travel expenditures, selecting the target business to merge with or acquire, and
structuring, negotiating and consummating the business combination. 

Critical
Accounting Policies 

Deferred
Offering Costs 

Deferred
offering costs consist of legal and other expenses incurred through the balance sheet date that are directly related to the initial public
offering and that were charged to shareholders equity upon the completion of the initial public offering. 

5 

Net
Loss Per Share 

Net
loss per share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period, excluding
ordinary shares subject to forfeiture by the Sponsor. Weighted average shares were reduced for the effect of an aggregate of 375,000
ordinary shares that were subject to forfeiture if the over-allotment option is not exercised by the underwriters (see Note 5).
At September 30, 2021, we did not have any dilutive securities and other contracts that could, potentially, be exercised or converted
into ordinary shares and then share in the earnings. As a result, diluted loss per share is the same as basic loss per share for the
period presented. 

Derivative
Financial Instruments 

We
evaluate our financial instruments to determine if such instruments are derivatives or contain features that qualify as embedded derivatives
in accordance with ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging . For derivative financial instruments that are accounted for
as liabilities, the derivative instrument is initially recorded at its fair value on the grant date and is then re-valued at each
reporting date, with changes in the fair value reported in the statements of operations. The classification of derivative instruments,
including whether such instruments should be recorded as liabilities or as equity, is evaluated at the end of each reporting period.
Derivative liabilities are classified in the balance sheet as current or non-current based on whether or not net-cash settlement
or conversion of the instrument could be required within 12 months of the balance sheet date. We have determined the warrants to
be issued in the initial public offering meet the requirements for equity classification. 

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements 

As
of September 30, 2021, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K. 

Contractual
Obligations 

We
do not have any long-term debt, capital lease obligations, operating lease obligations or long-term liabilities, other than an agreement
to pay an affiliate of the Sponsor a monthly fee of 10,000 for office space, utilities and administrative support. We began incurring
these fees on October 14, 2021 and will continue to incur these fees monthly until the earlier of the completion of the business combination
and our liquidation. 

The
underwriters are entitled to a deferred fee of 3,500,000. The deferred fee will become payable to the underwriters from the amounts
held in the trust account solely in the event that we complete a business combination, subject to the terms of the underwriting agreement. 

The
holders of the founder shares as well as the holders of the representative shares, private placement warrants and any warrants the sponsor,
officers, directors or their affiliates may be issued in payment of working capital loans made to us (and all underlying securities),
will be entitled to registration rights pursuant to an agreement signed on October 12, 2021. The holders of a majority of these securities
are entitled to make up to two demands that we register such securities. The holders of the majority of the founder shares can elect
to exercise these registration rights at any time commencing three months prior to the date on which these ordinary shares are to be
released from escrow. The holders of a majority of the representative shares, private placement warrants and warrants issued to the sponsor,
officers, directors or their affiliates in payment of working capital loans made to us (or underlying securities) can elect to exercise
these registration rights at any time after we consummate a business combination. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, EarlyBirdCapital,
Inc. may only make a demand on one occasion and only during the five-year period beginning on the effective date of the registration
statement. In addition, the holders have certain piggy-back registration rights with respect to registration statements
filed subsequent to the consummation of a business combination; provided, however, that EarlyBirdCapital, Inc. may participate in a piggy-back 
registration only during the seven-year period beginning on the effective date of the registration statement. We will bear the expenses
incurred in connection with the filing of any such registration statements.

ITEM
7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 

Through
September 30, 2021, our efforts have been limited to organizational activities, activities relating to our initial public offering. We
have engaged in limited operations and have not generated any revenues. We have not engaged in any hedging activities since our inception
on February 23, 2021. We do not expect to engage in any hedging activities with respect to the market risk to which we are exposed. 

The
net proceeds of the initial public offering and the sale of the private placement warrants held in the trust account, N.A., maintained
by Continental, acting as trustee, have been invested in United States government securities within the meaning of Section
2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act with a maturity of 185 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under
Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company Act which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations. Due to the short-term
nature of these investments, we believe there will be no associated material exposure to interest rate risk.

ITEM
9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Disclosure
controls are procedures that are designed with the objective of ensuring that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed
under the Exchange Act, such as this Report, is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time period specified in the
SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls are also designed with the objective of ensuring that such information is accumulated
and communicated to our management, including the chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure. Our management evaluated, with the participation of our principal executive officer and our
principal financial and accounting officer (our Certifying Officers ), the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and
procedures as of September 30, 2021, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act. Based upon that evaluation,
our Certifying Officers concluded that, as of September 30, 2021, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective. 

We
do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all errors and all instances of fraud. Disclosure controls and
procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the
disclosure controls and procedures are met. Further, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there
are resource constraints, and the benefits must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all disclosure
controls and procedures, no evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures can provide absolute assurance that we have detected all
our control deficiencies and instances of fraud, if any. The design of disclosure controls and procedures also is based partly on certain
assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated
goals under all potential future conditions. 

Management s
Report on Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting 

This
Annual Report on Form 10-K does not include a report of management s assessment regarding internal control over financial reporting
or an attestation report of our independent registered public accounting firm due to a transition period established by rules of the
SEC for newly public companies. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange
Act) during the most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal
control over financial reporting.

Leader in LiDAR Sensors and Perception Software for Autonomous Driving, in April 2021. Mr. Dozortzsev received a B.S. in Finance from
NYU Stern School of Business. We believe Mr. Dozortsev is well-qualified to serve on our board of directors due to his experience, including
with Collective Growth, and contacts and relationships. 

Noah
G. Levy has served as a member of our board of directors since our inception. Mr. Levy has been a managing member and portfolio manager
at Newtyn Management, LLC since he co-founded it in July 2011. Prior to that, Mr. Levy served as a senior member at Tyndall Management
from 2002 to 2011 and as an analyst at Goldman Sachs, an investment bank and financial services company, from 2000 to 2002. Mr. Levy
received a B.A. from Dartmouth College. Mr. Levy currently serves on the board of Merrimack Pharmaceuticals, Inc. a Nasdaq-listed biotechnology
firm. Mr. Levy is also a member of the ACLU investment committee. We believe Mr. Levy is qualified to serve on our board of directors
due to his investment management experience and strong financial and business acumen. 

Our
board of directors is divided into three classes with only one class of directors being elected in each year and each class serving a
three-year term. The term of office of the first class of directors, consisting of Noah G. Levy, will expire at our first annual meeting
of shareholders. The term of office of the second class of directors, consisting of Philip Broenniman and Eugene Dozortsev, will expire
at the second annual meeting. The term of office of the third class of directors, consisting of Ezra Gardner and Omri Cherni, will expire
at the third annual meeting. In accordance with Nasdaq corporate governance requirements, we are not required to hold an annual meeting
until one year after our first fiscal year end following our listing on Nasdaq. It is unlikely that there will be an annual meeting of
stockholders to elect new directors prior to the consummation of a business combination, in which case all of the current directors will
continue in office until at least the consummation of the business combination. 

Director
Independence 

Nasdaq
rules require that a majority of the board of directors of a company listed on Nasdaq must be composed of independent directors. 
An independent director is defined generally as a person other than an officer or employee of the company or its subsidiaries
or any other individual having a relationship, which, in the opinion of the company s board of directors, would interfere with
the director s exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director. We have determined that Philip
Broenniman, Eugene Dozortsev and Noah G. Levy are independent directors under the Nasdaq listing rules. Our independent directors hold
regularly scheduled meetings at which only independent directors are present. 

Any
affiliated transactions will be on terms no less favorable to us than could be obtained from independent parties. Our board of directors
will review and approve all affiliated transactions with any interested director abstaining from such review and approval. 

9 

Committees
of the Board of Directors 

We
have three standing committees: an audit committee, a nominating committee, and a compensation committee. Each such committee is composed
of solely independent directors. 

Audit
Committee 

Effective
on October 12, 2021, we established an audit committee of the board of directors, which consisst of Philip Broenniman, Eugene Dozortsev
and Noah G. Levy, each of whom is an independent director under Nasdaq s listing standards. The audit committee s duties,
which are specified in our Audit Committee Charter, include, but are not limited to: 

reviewing
 and discussing with management and the independent auditor the annual audited financial statements, and recommending to the board
 whether the audited financial statements should be included in our Form 10-K; 

discussing
 with management and the independent auditor significant financial reporting issues and judgments made in connection with the preparation
 of our financial statements; 

discussing
 with management major risk assessment and risk management policies; 

monitoring
 the independence of the independent auditor; 

verifying
 the rotation of the lead (or coordinating) audit partner having primary responsibility for the audit and the audit partner responsible
 for reviewing the audit as required by law; 

reviewing
 and approving all related-party transactions; 

inquiring
 and discussing with management our compliance with applicable laws and regulations; 

pre-approving
 all audit services and permitted non-audit services to be performed by our independent auditor, including the fees and terms of the
 services to be performed; 

appointing
 or replacing the independent auditor; 

determining
 the compensation and oversight of the work of the independent auditor (including resolution of disagreements between management and
 the independent auditor regarding financial reporting) for the purpose of preparing or issuing an audit report or related work; 

establishing
 procedures for the receipt, retention and treatment of complaints received by us regarding accounting, internal accounting controls
 or reports which raise material issues regarding our financial statements or accounting policies; and 

approving
 reimbursement of expenses incurred by our management team in identifying potential target businesses. 

Financial
Experts on Audit Committee 

The
audit committee will at all times be composed exclusively of independent directors who are financially literate 
as defined under Nasdaq s listing standards. Nasdaq s standards define financially literate as being able to
read and understand fundamental financial statements, including a company s balance sheet, income statement and cash flow statement. 

In
addition, we must certify to Nasdaq that the committee has, and will continue to have, at least one member who has past employment experience
in finance or accounting, requisite professional certification in accounting, or other comparable experience or background, including
actively supervising a principal financial officer, principal accounting officer, controller, public accountant, auditor or person performing
similar functions, that results in the individual s financial sophistication. The board of directors has determined that Mr. Broenniman
qualifies as an audit committee financial expert, as defined under rules and regulations of the SEC. 

10 

Nominating
Committee 

Effective
on October 12, 2021, we established a nominating committee of the board of directors, which consists of Philip Broenniman, Eugene Dozortsev
and Noah G. Levy, each of whom is an independent director under Nasdaq s listing standards. The nominating committee is responsible
for overseeing the selection of persons to be nominated to serve on our board of directors. The nominating committee considers persons
identified by its members, management, shareholders, investment bankers and others. 

Guidelines
for Selecting Director Nominees 

The
guidelines for selecting nominees, which are specified in the Nominating Committee Charter, generally provide that persons to be nominated: 

should
 have demonstrated notable or significant achievements in business, education or public service; 

should
 possess the requisite intelligence, education and experience to make a significant contribution to the board of directors and
 bring a range of skills, diverse perspectives and backgrounds to its deliberations; and 

should
 have the highest ethical standards, a strong sense of professionalism and intense dedication to serving the interests of the
 shareholders. 

The
Nominating Committee will consider a number of qualifications relating to management and leadership experience, background and integrity
and professionalism in evaluating a person s candidacy for membership on the board of directors. The nominating committee may require
certain skills or attributes, such as financial or accounting experience, to meet specific board needs that arise from time to time and
will also consider the overall experience and makeup of its members to obtain a broad and diverse mix of board members. The nominating
committee does not distinguish among nominees recommended by stockholders and other persons. 

There
have been no material changes to the procedures by which security holders may recommend nominees to our board of directors. 

Compensation
Committee 

Effective
on October 12, 2021, we established a compensation committee of the board of directors, which consists of Philip Broenniman, Eugene Dozortsev
and Noah G. Levy, each of whom is an independent director under Nasdaq s listing standards. The compensation committee s
duties, which are specified in our Compensation Committee Charter, include, but are not limited to: 

reviewing
 and approving on an annual basis the corporate goals and objectives relevant to our Chief Executive Officer s compensation,
 evaluating our Chief Executive Officer s performance in light of such goals and objectives and determining and approving the
 remuneration (if any) of our Chief Executive Officer based on such evaluation; 

reviewing
 and approving the compensation of all of our other executive officers; 

reviewing
 our executive compensation policies and plans; 

implementing
 and administering our incentive compensation equity-based remuneration plans; 

assisting
 management in complying with our proxy statement and annual report disclosure requirements; 

approving
 all special perquisites, special cash payments and other special compensation and benefit arrangements for our executive officers
 and employees; 

if
 required, producing a report on executive compensation to be included in our annual proxy statement; and 

reviewing,
 evaluating, and recommending changes, if appropriate, to the remuneration for directors. 

11 

Notwithstanding
the foregoing, as indicated below, other than the 10,000 per month administrative fee, no compensation of any kind, including finders,
consulting or other similar fees, will be paid to any of our existing stockholders, including our directors, or any of their respective
affiliates, prior to, or for any services they render in order to effectuate, the consummation of a business combination. Accordingly,
it is likely that prior to the consummation of an initial business combination, the compensation committee will only be responsible for
the review and recommendation of any compensation arrangements to be entered into in connection with such initial business combination. 

Code
of Ethics 

Effective
on October 12, 2021, we adopted a code of ethics that applies to all of our executive officers, directors, and employees. The code of
ethics codifies the business and ethical principles that govern all aspects of our business. We will provide, without charge, upon request,
copies of our code of ethics. Requests for copies of our code of ethics should be sent in writing to Hagag Towers North Tower, Floor
24 Haarba 28 Tel Aviv, Israel. 

ITEM
11. EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 

Executive
Compensation 

No
executive officer has received any cash compensation for services rendered to us. Commencing on October 12, 2021 through the acquisition
of a target business or our liquidation of the trust account, we will pay High House, an affiliate of Mr. Cherni, our Chief Operating
Officer and a Director, 10,000 per month for providing us with office space and certain office and secretarial services. However, this
arrangement is solely for our benefit and is not intended to provide our officers or directors compensation in lieu of a salary. 

We
may also pay consulting, success or finder fees to our Sponsor, officers, directors, initial shareholders or their affiliates in connection
with the consummation of our initial business combination. 

Other
than the 10,000 per month administrative fee, the payment of consulting, success or finder fees to our Sponsor, officers, directors,
initial shareholders or their affiliates in connection with the consummation of our initial business combination and the repayment of
the aggregate 150,000 of loans made by Varana Capital to us, no compensation or fees of any kind will be paid to our sponsor, initial
shareholders, members of our management team or their respective affiliates, for services rendered prior to or in connection with the
consummation of our initial business combination (regardless of the type of transaction that it is). However, they will receive reimbursement
for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in connection with activities on our behalf, such as identifying potential target businesses,
performing business due diligence on suitable target businesses and business combinations as well as traveling to and from the offices,
plants or similar locations of prospective target businesses to examine their operations. There is no limit on the amount of consulting,
success or finder fees payable by us upon consummation of an initial business combination. Additionally, there is no limit on the amount
of out-of-pocket expenses reimbursable by us; provided, however, that to the extent such expenses exceed the available proceeds not deposited
in the trust account, such expenses would not be reimbursed by us unless we consummate an initial business combination. 

After
our initial business combination, members of our management team who remain with us may be paid consulting, management or other fees
from the combined company with any and all amounts being fully disclosed to shareholders, to the extent then known, in the proxy solicitation
materials furnished to our shareholders. However, the amount of such compensation may not be known at the time of the shareholder meeting
held to consider an initial business combination, as it will be up to the directors of the post-combination business to determine executive
and director compensation. In this event, such compensation will be publicly disclosed at the time of its determination in a Current
Report on Form 8-K or a periodic report, as required by the SEC. 

Since
our formation, we have not granted any stock options or stock appreciation rights or any other awards under long-term incentive plans
to any of our executive officers or directors.

All
of the founders shares outstanding prior to the IPO have been placed in escrow with Continental Stock Transfer Trust Company,
as escrow agent, until 180 days after the date of the consummation of our initial business combination or earlier if, subsequent to our
initial business combination, we consummate a liquidation, merger, stock exchange or other similar transaction which results in all of
our shareholders having the right to exchange their ordinary shares for cash, securities or other property. 

During
the escrow period, the holders of these shares will not be able to sell or transfer their securities except for transfers, assignments
or sales (i) among our initial stockholders or to our initial stockholders members, officers, directors, consultants or their
affiliates, (ii) to a holder s stockholders or members upon its liquidation, (iii) by bona fide gift to a member of the holder s
immediate family or to a trust, the beneficiary of which is the holder or a member of the holder s immediate family, for estate
planning purposes, (iv) by virtue of the laws of descent and distribution upon death, (v) pursuant to a qualified domestic relations
order, (vi) to us for no value for cancellation in connection with the consummation of our initial business combination, or (vii) in
connection with the consummation of a business combination at prices no greater than the price at which the shares were originally purchased,
in each case (except for clause (vi) or with our prior consent) where the transferee agrees to the terms of the escrow agreement and
to be bound by these transfer restrictions, but will retain all other rights as our stockholders, including, without limitation, the
right to vote their ordinary shares and the right to receive cash dividends, if declared. If dividends are declared and payable in ordinary
shares, such dividends will also be placed in escrow. If we are unable to effect a business combination and liquidate, there will be
no liquidation distribution with respect to the founders shares. 

Our
executive officers and our Sponsor are our promoters, as that term is defined under the federal securities laws. 

Equity
Compensation Plans

ITEM
14. PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING FEES AND SERVICES. 

The
following is a summary of fees paid or to be paid to Marcum LLP, or Marcum, for services rendered. 

Audit
Fees . Audit fees consist of fees billed for professional services rendered for the audit of our year-end financial statements and
services that are normally provided by Marcum in connection with regulatory filings. The aggregate fees billed by Marcum for professional
services rendered were 30,000. 

Audit-Related

REPORT
OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of 

Gesher I Acquisition Corp. 

Opinion on the Financial Statements 

We have audited the accompanying balance sheet
of Gesher I Acquisition Corp. (the Company as of September 30, 2021, the related statements of operations, shareholders 
equity and cash flows for the period from February 23, 2021 (inception) through September 30, 2021, and the related notes (collectively
referred to as the financial statements ). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects,
the financial position of the Company as of September 30, 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the period from
February 23, 2021 (inception) through September 30, 2021, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America. 

Basis for Opinion 

These financial statements are the responsibility
of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audit. We
are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) ("PCAOB") and are
required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and
regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We conducted our audit in accordance with the
standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged
to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audit we are required to obtain an understanding
of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal
control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our audit included performing procedures to assess
the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond
to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating
the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

discussed in Note 3 (the IPO ), generating gross proceeds to the Company of . Each Unit consists of one ordinary

of the value of
the assets held in the Trust Account (as defined below) (excluding the deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on the interest
earned on the Trust Account) at the time of the agreement to enter into the initial Business Combination. However, the Company will only
complete a Business Combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires or more of the outstanding voting securities of
the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment
company under the Investment Company Act 1940, as amended (the Investment Company Act ). There is no assurance that the
Company will be able to complete a Business Combination successfully.

States government securities within the meaning of Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act with a maturity of 180
days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company Act which invest
only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations. Except with respect to interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account that
may be released to the Company to pay its income or other tax obligations as described in the IPO, the proceeds will not be released
from the Trust Account until the earlier of the completion of a Business Combination or the redemption of 100 of the outstanding public
shares if the Company has not completed a Business Combination within the time required time period.

the claims of target businesses or claims of vendors or other entities that are owed money by the Company for services rendered or contracted
for or products sold to the Company. The agreement entered into by the Sponsor specifically provides for two exceptions to the indemnity
it has given: it will have no liability (1) as to any claimed amounts owed to a target business or vendor or other entity who has executed
an agreement with the Company waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind they may have in or to any monies held in the Trust
Account, or (2) as to any claims for indemnification by the underwriters of the IPO against certain liabilities, including liabilities
under the Securities Act. Marcum LLP, the Company s independent registered public accounting firm, and the underwriters of the
IPO, will not execute agreements with the Company waiving such claims to the monies held in the Trust Account. The Company has not asked
the Sponsor to reserve for such indemnification obligations, nor has the Company independently verified whether the Sponsor has sufficient
funds to satisfy its indemnity obligations and believes that the Sponsor s only assets are securities of the Company. Therefore,
the Company believes it is unlikely that the Sponsor will be able to satisfy its indemnification obligations if it is required to do
so.

Company s liquidation, if there is a shareholder vote or tender offer in connection with the Business Combination and in connection
with certain amendments to the Company s amended and restated memorandum and articles of association. In accordance with ASC 480-10-S99,
redemption provisions not solely within the control of the Company require ordinary shares subject to redemption to be classified outside
of permanent equity. Therefore, all Public Shares were classified outside of permanent equity upon the IPO.

 DESCRIPTION OF REGISTRAN'S SECURITIES

Exhibit 4.4 

DESCRIPTION
OF REGISTRANT S SECURITIES 

 REGISTERED
PURSUANT TO SECTION 12 OF THE 

 SECURITIES
EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934 

The
following description of the securities of Gesher I Acquisition Corp. (the Company , we , our 
or similar terms) is based upon the Company s amended and restated memorandum and articles of association M A ),
the Companies Act (As Revised) of the Cayman Islands Companies Act and other applicable provisions of Cayman Islands
law. We have summarized certain portions of the M A below. The summary is not complete and is subject to, and is qualified in its
entirety by express reference to, the provisions of our M A, which is filed as an exhibit to the Annual Report on Form 10-K of which
this Exhibit 4.4 is a part. 

Authorized
Capital 

Pursuant
to M A, our authorized capital consists of 100,000,000 ordinary shares, par value 0.0001, and 1,000,000 preference shares, par value
 0.0001. 

Units 

Composition. Each
unit consists of one ordinary share and one-half of one redeemable warrant. Each whole warrant entitles the holder to purchase one ordinary
share for an initial exercise price of 11.50 per share, for a period of five years beginning upon consummation of an initial business
combination. 

Listing. The
Company s units, ordinary shares and warrants are listed on the Nasdaq Global Market under the ticker symbols GIACU, 
 GIAC and GIACW, respectively. 

Ordinary
Shares 

Authorization. The
outstanding ordinary shares are duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable. 

Voting
Rights. Ordinary shareholders of record are entitled to one vote for each share held on all matters to be voted on by shareholders. 

Conversion
Rights . Holders of ordinary shares issued in the Company s initial public offering (which we refer to as public shares have the right to demand that the Company convert such shares into a pro rata portion of the Company s trust account upon the consummation
of our initial business combination, either in connection with a shareholder meeting called to approve the business combination or by
means of a tender offer. 

The
decision as to whether we will seek shareholder approval of a proposed business combination or conduct a tender offer will be made by
us, solely in our discretion, and will be based on a variety of factors such as the timing of the transaction and whether the terms of
the transaction would require us to seek shareholder approval under the law or stock exchange listing requirement. 

If
a shareholder vote is not required and we do not decide to hold a shareholder vote for business or other legal reasons, we will, pursuant
to our M A, conduct the redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC ),
and file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to consummating our initial business combination. Our M A requires these tender
offer documents to contain substantially the same financial and other information about the initial business combination and the redemption
rights as is required under the SEC s proxy rules. If, however, shareholder approval of the transaction is required by law or Nasdaq
rules, or we decide to obtain shareholder approval for business or other reasons, we will offer to redeem shares in conjunction with
a proxy solicitation pursuant to the proxy rules and not pursuant to the tender offer rules. If we seek shareholder approval, we will
consummate our initial business combination only if a majority of the outstanding ordinary voted are voted in favor of the business combination.
Further, if we seek shareholder approval, we will require public shareholders, whether they are a record holder or hold their shares
in street name, to either tender their certificates to our transfer agent or to deliver their shares to the transfer agent
electronically using Depository Trust Company s DWAC (Deposit/Withdrawal At Custodian) System, at the holder s option, in
each case prior to a date set forth in the proxy materials sent in connection with the proposal to approve the business combination. There
is a nominal cost associated with the above-referenced delivery process and the act of certificating the shares or delivering them
through the DWAC System. The transfer agent will typically charge the tendering broker a nominal amount and it would be up to the broker
whether or not to pass this cost on to the holder. However, this fee would be incurred regardless of whether or not we require holders
seeking to exercise redemption rights to deliver their shares prior to a specified date. The need to deliver shares is a requirement
of exercising conversion rights regardless of the timing of when such delivery must be effectuated. However, in the event we require
shareholders seeking to exercise conversion rights to deliver their shares prior to the consummation of the proposed business combination
and the proposed business combination is not consummated this may result in an increased cost to shareholders. 

Outside
Date. Pursuant to our M A, if we are unable to consummate a business combination on or before April 14, 2023 (unless such
time period is extended by our shareholders, as provided in the M A), we will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of
winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than five business days thereafter, redeem 100 of the outstanding public
shares which redemption will completely extinguish public shareholders rights as shareholders (including the right to receive
further liquidation distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption,
subject to the approval of our remaining holders of ordinary shares and our board of directors, proceed to commence a voluntary liquidation
and thereby a formal dissolution of the company, subject (in the case of (ii) and (iii) above) to our obligations to provide for claims
of creditors and the requirements of applicable law. 

Our
initial shareholders, which include our sponsor, officers, and directors, have entered into agreements with us, pursuant to which they
have waived their rights to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to their initial shares if we fail to complete
our initial business combination by April 14, 2023 (subject to extension). However, if our initial shareholders or management team acquire
public shares, they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to such public shares if we fail
to complete our initial business combination by such date. 

Transfer
Restrictions. Subject to certain limited exceptions, our initial shareholders have agreed not to transfer, assign or sell their
founder shares until 180 days after the date of the consummation of our initial business combination or earlier if, subsequent to our
initial business combination, we consummate a subsequent liquidation, merger, stock exchange or other similar transaction which results
in all of our shareholders having the right to exchange their ordinary shares for cash, securities or other property. 

Additionally,
the holders of ordinary shares purchased prior to our initial public offering have agreed (A) to vote any shares owned by them in favor
of any proposed business combination, (B) not to convert any shares in connection with a shareholder vote to approve a proposed
initial business combination or any amendment to our M A prior to the consummation of our initial business combination and (C) not
to sell any shares to us in a tender offer in connection with any proposed business combination. 

Preemptive
Rights, Etc. Our shareholders have no conversion, preemptive or other subscription rights and there are no sinking fund or redemption
provisions applicable to the ordinary shares, except that public shareholders have the right to sell their shares to us in a tender offer
or have their ordinary shares redeemed for cash equal to their pro rata share of the trust account if they vote on the proposed business
combination in connection with such business combination and the business combination is completed. Public shareholders who sell or convert
their shares for their share of the trust account still have the right to exercise the warrants that they received as part of the units. 

Preference
Shares 

Our
M A provides that preference shares may be issued from time to time in one or more series. Our board of directors is authorized to
fix the voting rights, if any, designations, powers, preferences, the relative, participating, optional or other special rights and any
qualifications, limitations and restrictions, applicable to the shares of each series. Our board of directors will be able, without shareholder
approval, to issue preference shares with voting and other rights that could adversely affect the voting power and other rights of the
holders of ordinary shares and could have anti-takeover effects. However, the underwriting agreement that we entered into in connection
with the initial public offering prohibits us, prior to a business combination, from issuing preference shares which participate in any
manner in the proceeds of the trust account, or which vote as a class with the ordinary shares on a business combination. 

2 

Warrants 

Exercisability . Each
whole warrant is exercisable to purchase one ordinary share. 

Exercise
Price. 11.50 per share, subject to adjustment. 

The
exercise price and number of ordinary shares issuable on exercise of the warrants may be adjusted in certain circumstances including
in the event of a share dividend, extraordinary dividend or our recapitalization, reorganization, merger or consolidation. However, the
warrants will not be adjusted for issuances of ordinary shares at a price below their respective exercise prices. 

Exercise
Period . The warrants will become exercisable on the later of January 6, 2022 or the consummation of our initial business combination.
The warrants will expire five years after the consummation of our initial business combination, at 5:00 p.m., New York time, or earlier
upon our failure to consummate a business combination on or before April 14, 2023 (subject to extension) or redemption of our ordinary
shares or our liquidation. 

No
warrants will be exercisable for cash unless we have an effective and current registration statement covering the issuance of the
ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants and a current prospectus relating to such ordinary shares. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if a registration statement covering the issuance of the ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the public warrants is
not effective within 90 days from the closing of our initial business combination, warrant holders may, until such time as there is an
effective registration statement and during any period when we shall have failed to maintain an effective registration statement, exercise
warrants on a cashless basis pursuant to an available exemption from registration under the Securities Act. If an exemption from registration
is not available, holders will not be able to exercise their warrants on a cashless basis. The warrants will expire five years from the
closing of our initial business combination at 5:00 p.m., New York City time or earlier redemption. 

We
have agreed to use our best efforts to file and have an effective registration statement covering the ordinary shares issuable upon exercise
of the warrants, to maintain a current prospectus relating to those ordinary shares until the earlier of the date the warrants expire
or are redeemed and the date on which all of the warrants have been exercised, and to qualify the resale of such shares under state blue
sky laws, to the extent an exemption is not available. 

Redemption
of Warrants . Once the warrants become exercisable, we may call the warrants for redemption (excluding the private warrants and any
warrants issued to our initial shareholders, officers or directors in payment of working capital loans made to us), in whole and not
in part, at a price of 0.01 per warrant, upon not less than 30 days prior written notice of redemption (the 30-day redemption
period to each warrant holder, and if, and only if, the reported last sale price of our ordinary shares equals or exceeds 18.00
per share (as adjusted for share splits, share dividends, reorganizations and recapitalizations), for any 20 trading days within a 30
trading day period commencing after the warrants become exercisable and ending on the third business day prior to the notice of redemption
to warrant holders. We will not redeem the warrants unless an effective registration statement covering the ordinary shares issuable
upon exercise of the warrants is current and available throughout the 30-day redemption period. 

If
we call the warrants for redemption as described above, our management will have the option to require all holders that wish to exercise
warrants to do so on a cashless basis. In such event, each holder would pay the exercise price by surrendering the warrants
for that number of ordinary shares equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (x) the product of the number of ordinary shares underlying
the warrants, multiplied by the difference between the exercise price of the warrants and the fair market value by (y) the fair market
value. The fair market value for this purpose shall mean the average reported last sale price of the ordinary shares for
the five trading days ending on the third trading day prior to the date on which the notice of redemption is sent to the holders of warrants.
Whether we will exercise our option to require all holders to exercise their warrants on a cashless basis will depend on
a variety of factors including the price of our ordinary shares at the time the warrants are called for redemption, our cash needs at
such time and concerns regarding dilutive share issuances. 

Fractional
Shares. No fractional shares will be issued upon exercise of the warrants. If, upon exercise of the warrants, a holder would
be entitled to receive a fractional interest in a share, we will, upon exercise, round up to the nearest whole number the number of ordinary
shares to be issued to the warrant holder.

Certain
Provisions of our M A 

Our
amended and restated memorandum and articles of association filed under the laws of the Cayman Islands contain provisions designed to
provide certain rights and protections to our shareholders prior to the consummation of a business combination. The following are the
material rights and protections contained in our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association: 

we
shall either (1) seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination at a meeting called for such purpose at which shareholders
may seek to convert their shares, regardless of whether they vote for or against the proposed business combination or don t vote
at all, into their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account (net of taxes payable), or (2) provide
our shareholders with the opportunity to sell their shares to us by means of a tender offer (and thereby avoid the need for a shareholder
vote) for an amount equal to their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account (net of taxes payable),
in each case subject to the limitations described herein; 

we
will consummate our initial business combination only if we have net tangible assets of at least 5,000,001 either immediately prior
to or upon consummation of such business combination and, if we seek shareholder approval, an ordinary resolution under Cayman Islands
law is passed, which requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shareholders who attend and vote at a general meeting of the
company; 

if
our initial business combination is not consummated by April 14, 2023, then we will redeem all of the outstanding public shares and thereafter
liquidate and dissolve our company; 

upon
the consummation of the initial public offering, 115 million (including deferred underwriting commissions) was placed into the
trust account; 

we
may not consummate any other business combination, merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization
or similar transaction prior to our initial business combination; and 

prior
to our initial business combination, we may not issue additional shares that participates in any manner in the proceeds of the trust
account, or that votes as a class with the ordinary shares sold in this offering on an initial business combination. 

The
Companies Law permits a company incorporated in the Cayman Islands to amend its memorandum and articles of association with the approval
of the holders of at least 66-2/3 of such company s issued and outstanding ordinary shares. A company s articles of
association may specify that the approval of a higher majority is required but, provided the approval of the required majority is obtained,
any Cayman Islands company may amend its memorandum and articles of association regardless of whether its memorandum and articles of
association provides otherwise. Accordingly, although we could amend any of the provisions relating to our proposed offering, structure
and business plan which are contained in our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, we view all of these provisions
as binding obligations to our shareholders and neither we, nor our officers or directors, will take any action to amend or waive any
of these provisions unless we provide public shareholders with the opportunity to convert their public shares in connection with any
such vote. The foregoing is set forth in our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association and cannot be amended.
