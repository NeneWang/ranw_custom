ITEM
1. BUSINESS. 

Our
Business 

China
XD Plastics Company Limited China XD , we , and the Company , and us or our 
shall be interpreted accordingly) is one of the leading specialty chemical companies engaged in the research, development, manufacture
and sale of modified plastics primarily for automotive applications in China and to a lesser extent, in Dubai, United Arab Emirates UAE ).
Through our wholly-owned subsidiaries Heilongjiang Xinda Enterprise Group Company Limited HLJ Xinda Group ), Sichuan Xinda
Enterprise Group Company Limited Sichuan Xinda ), and AL Composites Materials FZE Dubai Xinda ), we manufacture
and sell polymer composite materials (a broader category including modified plastics), primarily for automotive applications. We develop
our products using our proprietary technology through our wholly-owned research laboratory owned by HLJ Xinda Group. We had 688 certifications
from manufacturers in the automobile industry as of December 31, 2020. We are the only company certified as a National Enterprise Technology
Center in modified plastics industry in Heilongjiang Province. Our research and development (the R D team consisted
of 127 professionals and 7 consultants as of December 31, 2020. As a result of the
combination of our academic and technological expertise, we had a portfolio of 647 patents, among which we have obtained 63 patent registrations
in China, and the applications for the remaining 584 were pending in China as of December 31, 2020. 

Modified
plastics are produced by changing the physical and/or chemical characteristics of ordinary resin materials. In order for plastics to
be used to produce automobile parts and components, they must satisfy certain physical criteria in terms of mechanical functionality,
stability under light and heat, durability, flame resistance, and environmental friendliness. Our unique proprietary formulas and processing
techniques enable us to produce low-cost high-quality modified plastic materials, which have been certified by many of the major domestic
and international automobile manufacturers in China. In addition, we also provide specially engineered plastics and environment-friendly
plastics for use in oil-field equipment, mining equipment, vessel-propulsion systems and power station equipment. 

China
XD s primary end-market is the Chinese automotive industry that has been rapidly growing for the past few years where our modified
plastics are used by our customers to fabricate the following auto components: exteriors (automobile bumpers, rearview and sideview mirrors,
license plate parts), interiors (door panels, dashboard, steering wheel, glove compartment and safety belt components), and functional
components (air conditioner casing, heating and ventilation casing, engine covers, and air ducts). Our specialized plastics are utilized
in more than 31 automobile brands manufactured in China, including leading brands such as Audi, Mercedes Benz, BMW, Toyota, Buick, Chevrolet,
Mazda, Volvo, Ford, Citroen, Jinbei, VW Passat, Golf, Jetta, etc. As of December 31, 2020, 688 of HLJ Xinda Group s automotive-specific
modified plastic products were certified by one or more of the automobile manufacturers in China and are in commercial production. As
of December 31, 2020, 347 of our products were in the process of product certification by automobile manufacturers . Due
to the global COVID-19 pandemic and outbreaks in Dubai, our Dubai s operation has been suspended since early February in 2020,
creating uncertainty of our oversea business in the foreseeable future. 

We
operate three manufacturing bases in Harbin, Heilongjiang and one manufacturing base in Nanchong, Sichuan Province, in the People s
Republic of China (the PRC ), as well as a manufacturing base in Dubai, UAE. As of December 31, 2020, in domestic market,
we had approximately 331,245 metric tons of production capacity across 91 automatic production lines utilizing German twin-screw extruding
systems, automatic weighing systems and Taiwanese conveyer systems. Prior to December 2012, we had approximately 255,000 metric tons
of annual production capacity across 58 automatic production lines utilizing German twin-screw extruding systems, automatic weighing
systems and Taiwan conveyer systems. In December 2012, we further expanded our third production base in Harbin with additional 135,000
metric tons of annual production capacity, bringing total installed production capacity in our three production bases to 390,000 metric
tons with additional 30 new production lines. 

3 

In
July 2017, our Harbin campus launched a new industrial project for upgrading existing equipment for 100,000 metric tons of engineering
plastics. As a result, the production capacity in Harbin, Heilongjiang was downgraded to 290,000 MT. In 2019, our Harbin campus started
another two equipment projects totaling 155,000 MT in Qinling Road Factory Qinling Road Project and Jiangnan Road Factory Jiangnan Road Project for equipment upgrade and overhaul progress, which further downgraded our production capacity to
135,000 MT. The industrial project for upgrading existing equipment for 100,000 metric tons of engineering plastics is expected to be
completed by the end of second quarter of 2020, and Qinling Road Project and Jiangnan Road Project was completed by the end of the third
quarter of 2020, bringing the production capacity back to 390,000 MT. In addition, in July 2017, HLJ Xinda Group also started an industrial
project for 300,000 metric tons of biological composite materials, an industrial project for a 3D printing intelligent manufacture demonstration
factory and a 3D printing display and experience cloud factory, which was broken ground in December 2019 with four workshops. The Company
expects the gradual trial out by the end of 2022 and put into production by the end of 2023, thus expanding the total production capacity
to 590,000 MT. 

In
December 2013, we broke ground on the construction of our fourth production plant in Nanchong City, Sichuan Province, with additional
300,000 metric tons of annual production capacity, which we expect will bring total domestic installed production capacity to 590,000
metric tons with the addition of 70 new production lines upon the completion of the construction of our fourth production plant. Sichuan
Xinda has been supplying to its customers since 2013. We installed 50 production lines in the second half of 2016 in our Sichuan plant
with production capacity of 216,000 metric tons during the year of 2017 and an additional 10 production lines in July 2018, bringing
the total capacity to 259,200 metric tons. As of December 31, 2020, there is still construction ongoing on the site of our Sichuan plant
which is expected to be completed by the end of the third quarter of 2022 . 

In
order to develop potential overseas markets, Dubai Xinda obtained one leased property and two purchased properties, approximately 52,530
square meters in total, including one leased 10,000 square meters, and two purchased 20,206 and 22,324 square meters on January 25, 2015,
June 28, 2016 and September 21, 2016, respectively, from Jebel Ali Free Zone Authority JAFZA in Dubai, UAE, with constructed
building comprising warehouses, offices and service blocks. In addition to the earlier 10 trial production lines in Dubai Xinda, the
Company completed installing 45 production lines with 11,250 metric tons of annual production capacity by the end of November 2018, and
an additional 30 production lines with 7,500 metric tons of annual production capacity. The Company previously estimated 22 production
lines to be put into production in the fourth quarter of 2021, and 8 production lines in the second quarter of 2022. Due to the negative
impact of COVID-19, this project was suspended and the Company hopes to resume the installation process by the second half of 2021 . 

4 

The
Company estimates 22 production lines will be put into production in the fourth quarter of 2021 and 8 production lines will be put into
production in the third quarter of 2022, thus increasing the total production capacity in Dubai Xinda to 21,250 metric tons, targeting
high-end products for the overseas market . 

Due
to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company s manufacturing facilities in Harbin and Sichuan were temporarily shut down from early February
2020 to early March 2020 while our Dubai facilities suspended operation since early February 2020 in accordance with the requirement
of the local governments. The Company s business both in China and overseas was negatively impacted and generated lower revenue
and net income during the period from February to April 2020. The extent of the impact of COVID-19 on the Company s results of
operations and financial condition will depend on the virus future developments, including the duration and spread of the outbreak
and the impact on the Company s customers, which are still uncertain and cannot be reasonably estimated at this point of time.

Our
Industry 

According
to a research report prepared exclusively for the Company and issued by Frost Sullivan in 2021, China is estimated to have consumed
approximately 25.6 million Metric Tons MT of modified plastic products in 2020, representing an increase of 2.8 
compared to 2019. With China being the world s leading manufacturing center and with rising domestic individual consumption, we
believe that demand for modified plastics from China will continue to increase in the foreseeable future. As shown in Figure 1, the market
demand for modified plastics will reach 33.2 million MT in 2023, representing compound annual growth rates CAGR of 7.0 
and 6.0 by sales volume and revenues from 2019 to 2023. Currently, demand for our products is primarily driven by the Chinese automotive
industry. In order for plastics to be used in automobile parts and components, they must satisfy specific physical criteria in terms
of mechanical functionality, stability under light and heat, durability, flame resistance, and environmental friendliness. Modified plastics
are usually found in interior materials, door panels, dashboards, mud flaps, chassis, bumpers, oil tanks, gas valves, grilles, unit heater
shells, air conditioner shells, heat dissipating grids, wheel covers, and other components.

According
to Frost Sullivan s report, stimulated by the development of China s automotive industry, the Chinese automotive modified
plastics market has gained solid development from 2014 to 2019, with a CAGR of 5.9 in sales volume and 8.1 in sales revenue during
this period. In 2020, given the slow-down of China s automotive production, sales volume of modified plastics will be negatively
affected. Going onwards, considering the lightweight trend of automotive development and demand on using modified plastics to replace
steel, the market is expected to maintain a moderate increase in terms of both sales volume and sales revenue, with CAGRs of 7.8 and
8.5 from 2021 to 2024, respectively.

The
production capacity is expected to reach 7.7 million MT in 2024, with a growth of 32.4 from 5.9 million MT in 2019. In terms of different
manufacturer types, domestic manufacturers expanded their production more rapidly than non-local manufacturers, which accounted for 75.4 
of the total production capacity in 2019 and is expected to take up to 77.7 by the end of 2024. 

Since
the growth of China s automotive industry is slowing, automotive modified plastics manufacturers have also decreased the expansion
rate of their production capacities. Overall, the total production capacity of Chinese automotive modified plastics industry increased
significantly in the past and is believed to continue its growth in the future. 

Source: Frost Sullivan 

As
illustrated in Figure 2, the Chinese automotive modified plastics market is expected to maintain an increase, with CAGR of 8.0 and 9.0 
in terms of both sales volume and sales revenue from 2020 to 2024, respectively. In terms of different manufacturer types, domestic manufacturers
expanded their production more rapidly than non-local manufacturers, which accounted for 75.4 of the total production capacity in 2019
and is expected to take up to 77.7 by the end of 2024. We believe that the demand for automotive modified plastic in China will grow
continuously due to the fast growing Chinese automotive market, the increasing use per unit of plastic content in automobiles and favorable
government incentives and regulations. Moreover, domestic producers will likely gain larger market share from imports as they are able
to manufacture products with comparable quality at highly competitive prices and close proximity to their customers. We believe that
the following are the key drivers for the automotive modified plastic industry in China.

According
to statistics by the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers CAAM in 2018, the production volume of automobiles
in China increased from 22,116.8 thousand units in 2013 to 27,809.2 thousand units in 2018. Decline in automotive production is noted
in 2018 and 2019 due to the weakened market demand as well as the reducing incentives granted by the Chinese government to automotive
manufacturers especially for EV manufacturers. The outbreak of COVID-19 in early 2020 created future disturbance to the market, and affects
normal business operation of automotive manufacturers. Production volume is anticipated to recover from the second quarter of 2020 as
the disease gradually becomes under control. The growth of the Chinese automotive industry is expected to slow down after several years 
rapid development and the CAGR of automotive production will be around 2.2 during the period from 2019 to 2023. Passenger cars accounted
for 85 of the total production volume in 2018. The production volume of passenger cars and commercial cars will grow at a CAGR of 2.1 
and 2.2 respectively during the period from 2019 to 2023. China has exceeded the United States
to become the world s largest auto market as measured by the number of automobiles sold. We believe the growth momentum in China s
auto sales will remain strong over the next four years. The automotive industry in China is still in its infancy with passenger car ownership
of 166 vehicles per 1,000 inhabitants in 2018, which is significantly below Europe s average of 526 and United States average
of 781 according to National Bureau of Statistics, US Department of Energy, Eurosta, Frost Sullivan. 

From
2014 to 2019, vehicles per 1,000 people in China has experienced a significant growth from 106 in 2014 to 178 in 2019, with the highest
CAGR of 10.9 among three regions. The significant gap of automobile ownership per 1,000 people among China, United States and Europe
indicates that the Chinese auto industry is still of huge growth potential. The gap is expected to be further narrowed with China s
vehicle per 1,000 people growing to 233 in 2024. vehicles per 1,000 people in U.S. and Europe exhibit a n anticipated moderate growth
in the future, considering the increasing demand on new energy vehicles.

According
to the National Bureau of Statistics, the total number of Chinese automobile parts has experienced a rapid growth because of economic
development and the incentive policies issued by the government. With the continuous development of the Chinese auto manufacturing industry
and expansion of auto consumption market, parts of automobiles increased from 144,750.0 thousand units in 2014 to 248,934.3 thousand
units in 2019 at a CAGR of 11.5 . It is expected that the number will keep growing and hit a record of 330,422.9 thousand units in 2024,
with a CAGR of 5.7 during the period from 2020 to 2024.

China
has achieved long-term economic growth and the nominal GDP per capita increased from RMB 47,314.8 in 2014 to RMB 68,469.2 in 2019. It
is predicated that China s nominal GDP per capita is expected to undergo a slower growth in 2020, due to the impact of COVID-19.
With the effective control of pandemic spread and optimistic vaccine development progress so far, the economy is expected to recover
in 2021 and grow steadily from 2021 to 2024. 

14 

The
Chinese government is attempting to stimulate domestic consumption and has introduced a series of related incentive policies. The per
capita consumption expenditure of urban household in China increased from RMB 19,968.0 in 2014 to RMB 28,063.0 in 2019, and is expected
to decline slightly to RMB27,605.2 in 2020 due to the outbreak of the pandemic. Further growth can be expected in the coming years considering
the economy s recovery.

Moreover,
cars have become more affordable in China as local or joint venture automobile manufacturers continuously expand their production to
achieve economies of scale to lower production cost and source cheaper auto parts locally. Growing income and decreasing vehicle prices
will continue to make car ownership more affordable for China s rising middle class. 

As
illustrated in Figure 6, the production volume of automobiles in China increased from 23,722.9 thousand units in 2014 to 25,720.0 thousand
units in 2019. Decline in automotive production is noted in years 2018 and 2019 due to the weakened market demand as well as the reducing
incentives granted by the Chinese government to automotive manufacturers especially for EV manufacturers. 

The
outbreak of COVID-19 in early 2020 created future disturbance to the market, and affected normal business operations of automotive manufacturers.
Production volume is anticipated to recover in 2021 as the disease is slowly under control. The growth of the Chinese automotive industry
is expected to slow down after several years rapid development and the CAGR of automotive production will be around 3.5 during
the period from 2020 to 2024. 

Passenger
cars accounted for 83 of the total production volume in 2019, and its production volume is anticipated to decline in 2020, as influenced
by COVID-19, and will grow at a CAGR of 4.6 from 2020 to 2024. The production volume of commercial cars is to increase rapidly due to
increasing demand from logistics and replacement due to the national standard upgrade in 2020, and return back to normal in 2021 and
onwards. 

Benefit
and Increasing Use of Plastics in Automobiles 

(1)
Cost Reduction: The primary demand driver for modified automotive plastics arises out of the cost-reduction characteristics evidenced
by the plastics material inclusion in the automobile manufacturing process. Modified plastics can deliver the same performance as metallic
materials at approximately a tenth of the cost. In addition, modified plastics can substitute some kinds of more expensive engineering
plastics. This benefit of modified plastics will become more significant with the increasing competition in automobile manufacturing
industry to improve efficiency and reduce costs. 

(2)
Vehicle Emissions Reduction: Plastic components impact fuel efficiency by saving approximately 2.5 liters of fuel per kilograms kg used (equivalent to 6 kg of CO2 emissions) over the lifetime of the vehicle. Automobile manufacturers have been reducing vehicle weights
in an attempt to reduce emissions and increase efficiencies. Modified plastics reduce the weight of components by 40 compared with traditional
metallic materials. 

(3)
Performance and Safety Improvement: The development of advanced plastics applications lead to the improvement in performance through
reducing the number and weight of the vehicle parts, causing the fuel consumption per vehicle to drop significantly. In addition, the
lower net weight of the vehicles improves handling performance and thereby eliminates the likelihood of losing control in case of emergency
stops. The involvement of modified plastics in automotive applications results in significant improvement of the safety features of the
vehicle parts, like seat belts, air bags, and air bag containers in the recent years. 

16 

(4)
New Applications: Plastics reduce the number of the required parts used in automobile manufacturing and introduce new design possibilities.
Conventional materials struggle to compete against this open innovation platform associated with the plastics industry. In addition,
the performance benefits associated with plastic materials continue to create a competitive advantage for the plastics industry. 

(5)
Increasing Use of Plastics per Vehicle: Weight of modified plastics per vehicle in China continually increased from 2008 to 2012 ,
and is forecasted to reach 169.8 kg by the end of 2017, with a growth rate of 40.2 according to Frost Sullivan s Report.
Although the weight of modified plastics per vehicle in China will still be less than that in North America and Europe, the highest growth
rate indicates the huge potential for market growth. In 2012, plastic use in China is estimated to be about 128.6 kg per vehicle, whereas
models imported from Europe contain on average as much as 219 kg per vehicle. In addition, the Chinese government s goals regarding
electric and hybrid vehicles may also push the market further as weight concerns are more important for these vehicles than for traditional
passenger cars. 

Production
 volume of electric vehicles (EV) in China grew from 78.5 thousand units in 2014 to 1,277.4 thousand units in 2010 dramatically, with
 a CAGR of 74.7 . China is leading the development of the EV industry and the largest market of EV in the world in 2019. Guided by
 the supportive policies, the EV industry will continue to be a development focus of the auto industry in China . 

The
 development of EV is a strong driver of auto modified plastics market since the production of battery packs for EV brings the demand
 for automotive modified plastics and the level of light-weight designs for EV is high. 

Increasing
Substitution of Imports 

Though
China s automotive plastic market has been dominated by foreign or joint venture JV companies, Chinese suppliers
are continually gaining market share. It is estimated that automotive plastics imported and manufactured by multinational and JV companies
accounted for 24.6 of the total China automotive plastic supply in 2019, decreasing from 31.5 in 2014 according to a report by Frost
 Sullivan. Compared to foreign competitors including JV companies, local manufacturers can largely benefit from the lower cost and
geographical convenience in China and their product sales can be customized with time-efficient after sales services and technical supports.
As the local production capacity of both domestic and foreign companies has been expanding, share of imports and multiple national companies
is expected to decrease to 22.3 by the end of 2024 , while the share of domestic manufacturers is forecast to rise to 77.7 in
2024 as they expand at a greater rate than MNC and JV in China. 

Favorable
National Government Policies 

In
the past decade, the Chinese government has adopted a number of policies and initiatives intended to encourage the development of the
Chinese modified plastics industry and stimulate the growth of the Chinese automobile industry. 

17 

Since
2000, modified plastics, including engineering plastics, have been categorized as a prioritized industrialization area by a series of
government guidelines or development plans. Some of these policies include: 

Guiding
 Catalogue for Major New Materials Applications (2019) was announced by Ministry of Industry and Information Technology in November
 2019, which clarified major new materials application into 23 categories of engineering plastics, special rubbers into the products
 eligible for insurance and subsidy. 

Guiding
 Catalogue of Industrial Structure Adjustment (2019) was announced by announced by the National Development and Reform Commission
 of the People s Republic in November 2019, which encouraged the development, production and application of engineering plastics
 modification. 

Guiding
 Catalogue for Key Products and Services in Strategic Emerging Industries (2016) was announced by the National Development and Reform
 Commission of the People s Republic in January 2017, which categorized new engineering plastics, plastic alloy, fire-retardant
 modified plastics, ABS, HIPS, high performance carbon fiber, etc.. as prior development fields in new material industry. 

The 13th Five Year Plan for Development of Strategic Emerging Industries in China launched in 2016 included favorable policies toward
advanced technologies in developing new aviation and space materials, encouraging the application of biodegradable plastics and the development
of high-performance plastics used for additive manufacturing, as well as encouraging the development of new material industries 

The Made in China 2025 initiative launched on May 8, 2015 by State Council, encouraged development of new materials, energy-saving
and new energy vehicles, power equipment, aerospace and aeronautical equipment, marine engineering and high-tech ships, modern railway
equipment and agricultural machinery. 

The Development Plan of Additive Manufacturing (2015-2016) initiative promulgated by the National Development and Reform
Commission, Ministry of Industry and Information Technology and Ministry of Finance of People s Republic of China on February 28,
2015, advocated domestic production of several types of plastics with high heat resistance and high strength for additive manufacturing
industry . 

It was stated in the Outline of China s Thirteenth Five-year Plan (2016) that new functional materials, advanced
structural materials, common base materials, fiber of high performance and its compounded material are key development directions of
new material industry. 

It was stated in the Catalogue for Guidance on Adjustment of Industrial Structure (2011) promulgated by the National Development
and Reform Commission on March 27, 2011, that the country is currently promoting (i) the development of production equipment of polycarbonate
by the use of non-phosgene method, with annual output of 60000t/year and above, (ii) the production of engineering plastic including
liquid crystalline polymer (LCP) and development and application of bleeding modification and alloying; (iii) the development and production
of water absorbed resin, conductible resin and biodegradable polymers; (iv) the development and production of new polyamide including
nylon 11, nylon 1414 and nylon 46, nylon with long carbon chain and heat resistant nylon. 

18 

It was stated in the Guidance on Key Areas of Industrialization of High Technology with Current Priority in Development (2011) 
jointly promulgated by the National Development and Reform Commission, the Ministry of Science and Technology, the Ministry of Commerce
and the State Intellectual Property Office on June 23, 2011 that modified technologies applied to general plastics, including new engineering
plastics and plastic alloy, new special engineering plastics, fire resistant modified plastics, and modified technology of general plastics,
are currently prioritized areas to develop and industrialize in China s macromolecule materials sector. 

It
was stated in the Investment Guide for Industrial Transforming and Upgrading (2011) promulgated by the Ministry of Industry
and Information Technology of the People s Republic of China that the country promoted the modification of waste plastics via the
comprehensive utilization of related technologies and suggested the future trend of the application of new materials in the industrial
area, including biodegradable plastics, engineering plastics, etc. 

A series of modified plastics technologies have been listed in the National Support for Key High-tech Fields as stated
in the Circular on the Issuance of the Administrative Measure for the Recognition of High-tech Enterprise jointly promulgated by the
Ministry of Science and Technology, Ministry of Finance, the State Administration of Taxation in April 2008. These technologies include
special engineering plastics, macromolecular compound or new synthetic modified, etc. 

Determining the detailed standards for average fuel consumption for passenger car manufacturers: 1) In 2015 average fuel consumption
for passenger car reach 0.069L per kilometer; 2) In 2020 average fuel consumption for passenger car reach 0.05L per kilometer. Such standards
will accelerate progress in the automobile weight reduction. 

In
addition, with the Chinese government strongly encouraging the production of more fuel-efficient and environmentally friendly vehicles,
as one means to help resolve the nation s worsening air pollution problem, especially in big cities, opportunities abound for suppliers
of plastics materials and auto components. 

We
believe that the above government measures and programs will continue to accelerate the demand for automotive modified plastics in China. 

Tightening
Trend and Local Government Policies 

Despite
the favorable national government policies as set forth above, in the past couple of years, the Chinese government has implemented certain
measures to control the pace of economic growth and discontinued certain stimulus measures implemented to deal with the recent global
financial crisis, including incentives for consumers to purchase automobiles. 

Since
2011, in order to resolve the extreme traffic congestion, Beijing government has been implementing a vehicle purchase quota policy, which
limits the maximum vehicles sold in Beijing per month to 20,000. Other cities which have begun to show signs of traffic congestion have
also begun to implement similar measures to control traffic congestion, including the limited automobile licenses policy implemented
in Shanghai and Tianjin and the imposition of congestion charges in Shenzhen. The termination of nation-wide preferential policies can
negatively affect consumer demand for new vehicles, and local restrictive measures over automobile purchases in major cities may result
in the reduction in the sale of vehicles nationwide.

Polypropylene is a chemical compound manufactured from petroleum. ABS is a common thermoplastic used to make light, rigid, molded products
such as automotive body parts and wheel covers. Nylon is a thermoplastic silky material. Approximately 1.6 of our total raw materials
purchased by volume are sourced from overseas petrochemical enterprises and 98.4 from domestic petrochemical enterprises during the
year ended December 31, 2020. 

The
Company has one-year renewable contracts with its major suppliers, which are distributors of petrochemical enterprises. Because the raw
materials used in our products are primarily petroleum products, the rise or fall in oil prices directly affects the cost of the raw
materials. We attempt to mitigate the increase or decrease in our raw materials prices by appropriately raising or lowering the price
for our products to pass the cost or savings to our customers as part of our pricing policy. 

Because
raw materials constitute a substantial part of the cost of our products, we seek to reduce costs by dealing with major suppliers. During
the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company purchased approximately 14.7 of the Company s raw materials from one major supplier.
By dealing in large quantities with these major suppliers, we obtain reduced prices for raw materials, therefore reducing the cost of
our products. If we were unable to purchase from these suppliers, we believe we would still have adequate sources of raw materials from
other petrochemical distributors without material impact on the cost of our products.

Certification
Process 

To
meet the requirements of an automobile manufacturer, products used as component parts must pass a rigorous certification process by the
manufacturer s technological quality assurance department before they can be approved for and used in production. The certification
process consists of three stages. 

First,
the automobile manufacturer reviews the manufacturer of modified plastics. The examination involves assessment of the operation history
of the modified plastics manufacturer, their experience in providing component services, the specialization of their factory equipment,
their research and development capacity and quality assurance systems. The manufacturer s operations need to meet the requirements
of the automobile manufacturer. Once the initial review is passed, the modified plastics manufacturer will obtain a qualification as
an automobile component manufacturer. This initial stage takes approximately sixteen to twenty-two months to complete. 

Second,
the automobile manufacturer and the manufacturer of modified plastics reach an understanding about a product specification. The modified
plastics manufacturer provides product research and development materials to the automobile manufacturer for inspection. The automobile
manufacturer tests the product specification according to its standards and, if results are satisfactory, the modified plastics manufacturer
obtains a product specification certification and enters the product certification stage. The second stage takes approximately eight
months to complete. 

Third,
the parties complete technology R D tests and perform automobile component finished parts tests. The product undergoes additional
testing by the automobile manufacturer and is used in road tests. This stage takes approximately five to fifteen months depending on
whether the car model is an existing model or a new model. At the conclusion of the third stage, the modified plastics manufacturer receives
a product certification from the automobile manufacturer. 

We
believe that the necessity, rigorousness, complexity and duration of the certification process make it difficult for outside competitors
to enter the field in a short period of time. We had 688 certifications from automobile manufacturers as of December 31, 2020, which
we believe is currently one of the largest portfolios of product certifications in the Chinese automobile modified plastics industry. 

Sales
and Marketing 

Currently,
our sales network focuses on the northeastern, northern, eastern and southwestern regions of China. We primarily sell to end customers
through our approved distributors. To a less extent, we also sell directly to end customers. A typical customer development cycle starts
when our R D staff develops customized products for new end customers and obtains product certifications. These end customers are
usually major automobile parts manufacturers who can only source from suppliers like China XD with product certifications granted by
major automobile manufacturers. After we established relationships with these end customers and began to have large volume of transactions
with them, we assign end customers to our approved distributors according to our internal policies. We also acquired end customers with
our existing certifications from time to time. In 2020, approximately 82.9 of our sales were generated from approved distributors. 

We
enter into distribution agreements with local distributors in areas where large automobile manufacturers are located. The distribution
agreements usually have a term of one year, during which period we can enter into distribution agreements with other distributors for
our products. The distributors are responsible for marketing and distributing our products. Through the established sales channels, we
can quickly respond to local market demand, address customer needs, enhance our ability to provide technical support and after-sales
services, and lower our marketing expenses. Our general credit term with our distributors is three months and our collection of payment
from distributors is not contingent upon their cash collection from end customers. We manufacture products according to orders received
from our distributors and maintain a certain quantity of raw materials based on our experience and the distributors order patterns. By
doing this we hope to ensure the smooth implementation of the production plan of major automobile manufacturers and avoid risks of inventory
shortage. We do not provide the distributors nor end customers with the right of return, price protection or any other concessions. We
allow for an exchange of products or return only if the products are defective. 

60 

We
have been actively engaging our distribution network with 11 distributors in 2020 and we believe we have good relationships with
our distributors. We believe that we have been able to secure and maintain strong relationships with end customers due to our existing
certifications, advanced technologies and high product quality, which establish a higher barrier to entry for others. Most of the end
customer relationships will be developed through our own R D and sales force and maintained by our R D and sales professionals
and our distributors. According to our distribution contracts, our distributors are prohibited from selling our competitors products
and required to use the product certificate, brand name and package standards set by us during the distribution period. After the expiration
of the distribution contracts in absence of renewal, we retain the customer relationships with end customers. 

While
the pricing volatility of our raw materials is a primary cause of cost variations in our products, we are generally able to pass the
cost of price changes in our raw materials to our customers, although there are timing delays of varying lengths depending upon volatility
of raw material prices, the type of products, competitive conditions and individual customer arrangements. 

We
sell our products substantially through approved distributors in the PRC. Our sales to our distributors are highly concentrated but have
been gradually diversified in recent years. Sales to major distributors, which individually exceeded 10 of our revenues, accounted for
approximately 9.3 and 10 of our revenues for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. We expect to reduce
our distributor concentration over time, although revenues from these distributors are expected to continue to represent a substantial
portion of our revenue in the future. Further information about our major distributors and the director customer, which individually
exceeded 10 of our revenues, for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, is set forth in Note 22 of the notes to the consolidated
financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

We
have initiated our marketing efforts to develop new customers outside of China, in particular those in the UAE market. We have started
offering certain high-end products, such as PA66 and long-chain Plastic Alloy, most manufactured in Heilongjiang plants and a small portion
manufactured in Dubai plant since the second quarter of 2014. In January 2015, we completed and run the trial production in the plant
in Dubai, UAE with additional 2,500 metric tons targeting high-end products for the overseas markets. We plan to serve customers in oversea
markets from our Dubai Xinda plant. In order to develop potential overseas markets, Dubai Xinda obtained one leased property and two
purchased properties, approximately 52,530 square meters in total, including one leased 10,000 square meters, and two purchased 20,206
and 22,324 square meters on January 25, 2015, June 28, 2016 and September 21, 2016, respectively, from Jebel Ali Free Zone Authority JAFZA in Dubai, UAE, with constructed building comprising warehouses, offices and service blocks. In addition to the
earlier 10 trial production lines in Dubai Xinda, we completed installing 45 production lines with 11,250 metric tons of annual production
capacity by the end of November 2018. As of December 31, 2020 , an additional 30 production lines with 7,500 metric tons of annual
production capacity mainly targeted for ABS products, were still in the progress of redesigning upgrading and further equipment testing.
The Company estimates 22 production lines will be put into production in the fourth quarter of 2021, 8 production lines will be put into
production in the second quarter of 2022, and will then increase the total production capacity in Dubai Xinda to 21,250 metric tons,
targeting high-end products for the overseas market. 

61 

After
a successful trial production at our production base in Dubai in November 2018, we have established business relationships with new customers
in UAE and India, and shipped products to the end users in Europe and Southeast Asia. We are optimistic about the prospect of our business
expansion overseas. 

Information
about geographic revenue is set forth in Note 24 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual
Report on Form 10-K. 

Competition

The
PRC automotive modified plastics industry is growing rapidly and highly fragmented with the top four domestic producers occupying less
than approximately 28.8 of the market shares in 2018 according to Frost Sullivan s report. According to Frost Sullivan s
report, in terms of sales volume and production capacity, we are one of the leading domestic specialized manufacturers of modified plastic
for automobile parts in China, with a market share of approximately 7.7 in 2020 and 5.4 in 2019. In 2020, our sales volume of
automotive plastics was approximately 325,210 MT. As of December 31, 2020, our annual production capacity of automotive plastics was
405,450 MT. 

Due
to our high quality standard and competitive pricing, we are able to compete in and penetrate markets outside of China. 

After
a successful trial production at our production base in Dubai in November 2018, the Company has established business relationships with
new customers in UAE and India, and shipped products to the end users in Europe and Southeast Asia. We are optimistic about the prospect
of our business expansion overseas. 

Currently,
the Company s primary Chinese competitor in the automobile industry is Guangzhou Kingfa Science Technology Co., Ltd. Guangzhou
Kingfa ). Guangzhou Kingfa entered the automotive modified plastics market in 2006 and had a sales volume of 514,000 MT in 2018
with a market share of 11.7 in 2019, according to Frost Sullivan s report. Guangzhou Kingfa has the largest capacity expansion
with 2.44 million MT annual production capacity, including 2.43 million MT annual modified plastics at the end of 2020 based on
Guangzhou Kingfa s public disclosure, but its utilization rate of production capacity is expected to be lower than that of China
XD based on Frost Sullivan s report. Guangzhou Kingfa has much larger financial resources than HLJ Xinda Group and Sichuan
Xinda. However, we believe that it is less focused in automotive sector and currently holds fewer number of product certifications for
automotive modified plastic to the automobile industry compared to HLJ Xinda Group and Sichuan Xinda. Another top domestic manufacturer
of modified plastic is Shanghai Pret Composites Co., Ltd. Shanghai Pret ), which focuses on the production of automotive
plastics. It had a sales volume of 203,000 MT with a market share of 4.6 in 2019, according to Frost Sullivan s report. 

Historically,
the Chinese auto market predominantly used modified plastics manufactured overseas or in factories controlled by foreign companies, such
as manufacturers from Germany, the US, the Netherlands and Japan. Although China s automotive plastic market has been dominated
by foreign or JV players, Chinese suppliers are continuing to gain market share. It is estimated that automotive plastics imported or
manufactured by multinational and JV companies accounted for approximately 21.6 of the total China automotive plastic supply in
2019 , decreased from 31.5 in 2014. JV manufacturers based in China in automotive plastics sector have been slow to invest
and expand in China. Compared to non-domestic competitors including JV manufacturers, domestic manufacturers can benefit from the lower
costs and geographical proximity in China. As local players continue to invest in research and development, enhance product quality and
improve management skills, we believe that domestic production of automotive plastics will compete very favorably with the foreign competitors
in terms of price, quality, services and delivery times and continue to replace imported plastics. 

62 

Our
Competitive Strengths 

We
believe that the following competitive strengths continue to enable us to compete effectively in the automotive modified plastics market
in the PRC: 

Leading
 Market Position in an Industry with High Barrier to Entry . We believe that we are one of the China s leading specialized
 manufacturers of modified plastic for automobile parts in terms of sales volume and production capacity, with a market share of approximately
 the second TOP 10 largest in 2019. The PRC automotive modified plastics industry is growing rapidly and is highly fragmented
 with the top three domestic producers occupying less than approximately 21.7 of the market share in 2019 . 
 
 We
 installed 50 new product lines in 2012 and 2013, which are utilized primarily for the manufacture of higher value-added modified
 plastics products. The lines increased the Company s total production capacity by 135,000 MT to 390,000 MT per annum. In July
 2017, the Company launched a new industrial project for upgrading existing equipment for 100,000 metric tons of engineering plastics,
 which was originally expected to be completed by the end of the second quarter of 2020. The reason for such delay is due to additional
 time for equipment installation and testing. As a result, our production capacity in Harbin, Heilongjiang was downgraded to 290,000
 MT as of December 31, 2018. Due to the need for equipment upgrade and overhaul, our Harbin campus further downgraded its production
 capacity to 135,000 MT as of December 31, 2019, in Qinling Road Factory Qinling Road Project and Jiangnan Road Factory
 Jiangnan Road Project ), which was originally scheduled to be completed by end of the third quarter of 2020, to bring
 the production capacity in Harbin campus back to 390,000 MT. Simultaneously, our Harbin campus also included an industrial project
 for 300,000 metric tons of biological composite materials, an industrial project for a 3D printing intelligent manufacture demonstration
 factory and a 3D printing display and experience cloud factory, which was broken ground in December 2019 with four workshops. However,
 both production upgrade and new projects have been delayed due to the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic since early 2020. 

In
December 2013, we broke ground on the construction of our fourth production plant in Nanchong City, Sichuan Province, with additional
300,000 metric tons of annual production capacity, which is expected to bring total domestic installed production annual capacity to
690,000 metric tons with the addition of 70 new production lines upon the completion of the construction of our fourth production plant.
Sichuan Xinda has been supplying to its customers since 2013, mainly backed by production capacity in our Harbin production plant until
we installed 50 production lines in the second half of 2016 at our Sichuan plant with production capacity of 216,000 metric tons during
2017. We installed an additional 10 production lines in July 2018, bringing the total capacity to 259,200 metric tons. As of December
31, 2020 , there is still construction ongoing on the site of our Sichuan plant for equipment installation, and we expect to put
into production by the end of the first half of 2021. 

In
addition, we completed and run the trial production in the plant in Dubai, UAE with additional 2,500 metric tons targeting high-end products
for the overseas markets. In order to develop potential overseas markets, Dubai Xinda obtained one leased property and two purchased
properties, approximately 52,530 square meters in total, including one leased 10,000 square meters, and two purchased 20,206 and 22,324
square meters on January 25, 2015, June 28, 2016, and September 21, 2016, respectively, from Jebel Ali Free Zone Authority JAFZA in Dubai, UAE, with constructed building comprising warehouses, offices and service blocks.

As
of December 31, 2020 our annual production capacity of automotive plastics totaled 405,450 MT, including 394,200 MT in domestic production
bases and 11,250 in Dubai campus. In 2019, our sales volume of automotive plastics was approximately 360,072 MT, representing a decrease
of 18.8 compared to that in 2019 , primarily because of the supply chain interruption caused by both the global COVID-19 pandeic
and chip shortage since early 2020, Our overseas sales were nil in the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to US 61.2 million
in prior year also due to the above reference factors. 

We
believe our leading market position allows us to successfully compete with other foreign and domestic modified plastic manufacturers
in the market. Being one of the leading specialized manufacturers of automotive modified plastics in China, we believe we are well-positioned
to not only grow with the increasing market demand but increase market share by replacing smaller and less efficient modified plastic
manufacturer. 

In
addition, as a result of our consistent research and development efforts, we had 688 product certifications from major automotive
manufacturers in the PRC as of December 31, 2020, which we believe is among the largest numbers of product certifications by any
domestic player in China s automotive plastics industry. Strict certification requirements and long certification periods result
in high barriers to entry. Our current or potential competitors are required to obtain relevant product certifications from automotive
manufacturers in order to compete with us. Each certification normally takes over two years to complete, and as a result, automotive
manufacturers are reluctant to replace suppliers like us who have already received necessary certifications and proven consistent product
quality. We believe that having one of the largest portfolios of product certifications in China allows us to strengthen our competitive
position. 

Long-Term
 Relationships with Reputable End Users . Our senior management has been involved in the business of modified plastics since 1985.
 We benefit from the industry connections and experience of our senior management, which have enabled us to establish long-term customer
 relationships and strong industry recognition. We are a qualified provider of high-quality automotive plastics, and have sold our
 products through plastic auto part manufacturers to many leading automotive manufacturers in China. Currently, our modified plastics
 are utilized in more than 29 automobile brands and 111 automobile models manufactured in China, including Audi, Mercedes Benz, BMW,
 Toyota, Buick, Chevrolet, Mazda, Volvo, Ford, Citroen, Jinbei, VW Passat, Golf, Jetta, etc. We believe that our brand and our products
 are well recognized and respected in China s automotive modified plastics market. 

Manufacturing
 facilities critical to the quality of products . We have in the past invested substantial time and resources in building state-of-the-art
 production lines to enhance our product quality. Our facilities have maintained ISO/TS16949, a certification of quality management
 systems specific to the automotive industry. 

Strong
 Customer-Oriented R D Capabilities . The modified plastics industry is characterized by rapid development and increasing demand
 for high quality products. We have strong R D capabilities that allow us to successfully pass OEM automakers certification
 processes in the past and continually introduce new and high quality products to the market. Compared to international plastic supply
 models, which target larger scale applications of common plastics and involve less customization and specialization, we provide customer-oriented
 product development through our certification process. By working closely with our customers, we are able to adjust our product features
 to better satisfy the specific needs of each customer. To achieve this, we have staffed our R D team with professionals, 24 of
 whom have Ph.D. and/or Master s degrees. On average, our R D employees have worked with us for more than three years, and
 some key experts have more than 10 years of experience in our industry. We have also cooperated with a number of the leading technology
 centers in China. Besides providing specialized research and development skills, these relationships help us formulate cutting edge
 research programs aimed at developing new technologies and applications in plastics engineering. We currently have 32 approved patents
 and 477 pending patent applications with the State Intellectual Property Office of the PRC, or SIPO. 

Established
 Distribution Model . Through twelve distributors across China, we have established distribution networks that cover Northeast,
 North, Southwest and East China, with a current focus on Northeast China. We enter into distribution agreements with local distributors
 in areas where large automobile manufacturers are located. By leveraging the proximity of our distributors to the automobile manufacturers,
 we can enhance our relationships with our customers. Through the established sales channels, we can quickly respond to local market
 demand, address customer needs, enhance our ability to provide superior technological support and after-sales services, and lower
 our marketing expenses. At the same time, our distributors are responsible for the payments to us which is not contingent upon their
 cash collection from end customers. By actively managing our distribution network, we are also able to accelerate local market penetration
 and increase sales opportunities. For example, we entered the north China market in 2009 through a local distributor, one year earlier
 than we planned, and in 2013, we entered into the Southwest China market, and in 2014, we entered into South China and Central China
 market. For the year ended December 31, 2019, Northeast, East, North, Southwest, Central and South accounted for approximately 32.2 ,
 26.4 , 15.7 , 9.2 , 6.3 and 6.0 of our revenues, respectively. 

Stable
 Presence to Overseas Market. The Company has tried to develop new overseas customers and has established a business relationship
 with an overseas customer in Ras Al Khaimah, UAE in fourth quarter of 2018. After a successful trial production at our production
 base in Dubai in November 2018, the Company has established business relationships with new customers in UAE and India, and shipped
 products to the end users in Europe and Southeast Asia. US 61.2 million products have been sold to overseas market, accounting for
 4.2 of the total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2019. 

Seasoned
 Management Team . Our senior management team and key personnel have extensive operating and industry experience. Mr. Han, our
 chief executive officer and president, founded our former affiliate Harbin Xinda Nylon Factory in 1985. With 30 years of industry
 experience, Mr. Han has in-depth knowledge and expertise in China s modified plastics industry. Our chief executive officer,
 chief technology officer and chief operating officer have over 50 years combined experience in the modified plastics industry and
 we believe their extensive expertise and knowledge can well serve our customers.

Our
Strategies 

Our
goal is to capitalize on China s modified plastics growth trend, with a specific focus on applications in the auto sector, and
to eventually be the leading modified plastics manufacturer in China. We are committed to enhancing our sales and profitability and achieving
our goals through the following strategies: 

Continue
to Expand/Upgrade Production Capacity . Over the past five years, we have consistently increased production capacity to meet the
rising demands of the automotive industry in the PRC. As of December 31, 2019, we have an installed annual production capacity of
394,200 metric tons in domestic production bases, and we have been operating at near full capacity since 2007. With the expected
strong growth in the automotive modified plastics market of China, we expect that we will continue to experience strong demand from
our customers. Therefore, we intend to continue to strategically increase our production capacity to meet customer demands from both
expanded geographical locations and future downstream sector growth. In 2013, we commenced to construct our fourth production base
with 300,000 MT new material production capacity and the affiliated research and development center and training center in Nanchong
City of Sichuan Province (the Project ). We installed 50 production lines with production capacity of 216,000 metric
tons in the second half of 2016 in our Sichuan plant and additional 10 production lines in July 2018, bringing the total capacity to
259,200 metric tons. As of December 31, 2019, there was still construction ongoing on the site of our Sichuan plant which is
expected to be completed by the end of the fourth quarter of 2020. 

The
Company completed and started the trial production in the plant in Dubai, UAE with additional 2,500 metric tons targeting high-end products
for the overseas markets. The Company completed installing 45 production lines with 11,250 metric tons of annual production capacity
by the end of November 2018. As of December 31, 2019, an additional 30 production lines with 7,500 metric tons of annual production capacity
mainly targeted for ABS products, were still in the progress of redesigning upgrading and further equipment testing. The Company estimates
22 production lines will be put into production in the fourth quarter of 2021, 8 production lines will be put into production in the
second quarter of 2022, then, bringing total installed production capacity in Dubai Xinda to 21,250 metric tons, targeting high-end products
for the overseas market. 

Since
2013, the HLJ Xinda Group had approximately 390,000 metric tons of annual production capacity across 88 automatic production lines utilizing
German twin-screw extruding systems, automatic weighing systems and Taiwan conveyer systems. In July 2017, the HLJ Xinda Group launched
a new industrial project for upgrading existing equipment for 100,000 metric tons of engineering plastics, which we expect to be completed
by the end of the second quarter of 2020. The reason for such delay is due to additional time for equipment s installation and
test. In 2019, HLJ Xinda Group started another two equipment projects totaling 155,000 MT in Qinling Road Factory Qinling Road
Project and Jiangnan Road Factory Jiangnan Road Project for equipment upgrade and overhaul progress, which is
expected be completed by the end of the third quarter of 2020. Also included is an industrial project for 300,000 metric tons of biological
composite materials, an industrial project for a 3D printing intelligent manufacture demonstration factory and a 3D printing display
and experience cloud factory, all of which we expect to be completed by the end of 2023. 

Focus
on R D and Develop New Product Offerings . We are currently utilizing our R D capabilities to obtain further product
certifications, develop new products, applications and technologies. Approximately 90 of our automotive plastics product
certification applications are currently undergoing trial manufacturing periods to obtain the necessary certifications. In addition,
we are developing new products for automotive applications to expand our product portfolio, including initiating R D on modified
plastic for use in electric vehicles. We also have increased efforts directed towards
applications in new electrical equipment and electronics, alternative energy applications, power devices, aviation equipment and
ocean engineering, in addition to other new products primarily for advanced industrialized applications in the automobile sector and
in new verticals such as ships, airplanes, high-speed rail, 3D printing materials, biodegradable plastics, and medical
devices. We are the first non-State-Owned-Enterprise awarded National Level Enterprise Technology Center, in Heilongjiang
Province. In addition, we have Postdoctoral and Academy Member Workstation in Heilongjiang Province enhancing our research and
development capabilities. 

65 

Expand
Customer Base Domestically and Internationally . The automotive plastics market in the PRC is highly fragmented with significant
barriers to entry. In 2016, we had 8.0 of the market share with our customer coverage was originally concentrated in the northeast
regions of the PRC. We seek to steadily enhance our market share in Northeast China, and also expand our reach to East China,
Central China, Southwest China and South China. In addition, we have conducted sales in overseas markets and exported our products
including non-auto sectors since 2014. In 2018, we had 8.0 of the market share, ranking the second in terms of sales volume of
automotive modified plastics in China. We plan to implement such strategies through further expanding our distribution network by
working with local distributors who have contacts and networks overseas and directly establishing strategic alliances with certain
of our non-PRC customers. Although the entry barrier of some non-auto sectors might not generally be as high as that of the auto
sector, our focus is to target high-value-added products by leveraging our technology, expertise and know-how accumulated in the
auto sector over the course of our operational history. 

Pursue Selective Strategic Acquisitions . While we have experienced substantial organic growth, we plan to pursue a
disciplined and targeted acquisition strategy to accelerate our growth. Our strategy will focus on strengthening presence in certain
geographies, improving our penetration in attractive markets, enhancing research and development capabilities and acquiring new
markets or customers. 

Increase
Efficiency by Corporate Restructuring . We completed our corporate restructuring plan at the end of 2014 and further optimized
our management structure and enhancing efficiency in 2018, with the aim of establishing a more efficient company group structure, as
a result of which our subsidiaries are more easily accessible to our end customers and our operations are able to respond to the
market changes in a more efficient manner. 

Environmental
Laws 

The
cost of compliance with Chinese environmental regulations currently is minimal. Most of the waste produced from our production process
is water, which we circulate in our enclosed water treatment system. 

66 

Employees 

China
XD s operations are organized into several operational departments including manufacturing, R D, management, finance, sales,
purchasing and marketing and others. As of December 31, 2020, there were 967 employees, including 450 in manufacturing, 118 in R D,
155 in management, 19 in finance, 112 in sales, purchasing and marketing and 113 in other departments .

ITEM
1A. RISK FACTORS 

In
addition to the other information in this Form 10-K, readers should carefully consider the following important factors. These factors,
among others, in some cases have affected, and in the future could affect, our financial condition and results of operations and could
cause our future results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements that appear in this on
Form 10-K or that we have made or will make elsewhere. 

The
global economic uncertainty could further impair the automotive industry thereby limiting demand for our products. 

The
continuation or intensification of the recent global economic uncertainty arising from the Brexit crisis, the worldwide disruption and
negative impact on the macro-economic environment caused by the outbreak of COVID-19 and the economic slowdown in Asia may adversely
impact our business and the businesses of our customers. Our specialized plastics are sold to automobile parts manufacturers and distributors.
The recent global economic uncertainty has harmed most industries and is detrimental to the automotive industry. Since virtually all
of our sales are made to auto industry participants, our sales and business operations are dependent on the financial health of the automotive
industry and could suffer if our customers experience, or continue to experience, a downturn in their business. Presently, it is unclear
whether and to what extent the economic stimulus measures facilitated by the European Union and other governments throughout the world
will mitigate the effects of the crisis on the automotive industry and other industries that affect our business. 

67 

We
concentrate our operations primarily in the automotive industry; therefore, the fluctuations in automotive sales and production could
have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and liquidity. 

We
develop, manufacture, and distribute modified plastic, primarily for use in automobiles. Automotive sales and production are highly cyclical
and depend, among other things, on general economic conditions and consumer spending and preferences (which can be affected by a number
of issues including fuel costs and the availability of consumer financing). As the volume of automotive production fluctuates, the demand
for our products also fluctuates. According to China Association of Automobile Manufacturers, for the year ended December 31, 2019, automobile
production and sales in China decreased by 7.5 and 8.2 , respectively as compared to the same period of 2018. A weakening in macroeconomic
conditions since summer of 2018 has deteriorated business conditions. There can be no assurance that the market conditions, government
policies and other factors will help the growth rate in the future. Any contraction in automotive sales and production will harm our
results of operations and financial condition. Consequently, we are exposed to the risks of adverse developments affecting the auto industry
to a greater extent than if our operations were dispersed over a variety of industries. 

Our
financial performance may be affected by the prospects of our Dubai facility and the associated expansion into Middle East, Europe and
other parts of Asia. 

In
2014, we embarked our entry into the international market by primarily marketing long carbon chain PA plastic alloy and high-performance
modified PA66 products. After a successful trial production at our production base in Dubai in November 2018, we have established business
relationships with new customers in UAE and India, and shipped products to the end users in Europe and Southeast Asia. We have experienced
a delay in cash collection from a major customer in UAE. As of December 31, 2019, we provided an allowance of US 62.8 million for the
overdue accounts receivable from the major customer in UAE, as the customer failed to make payments under the agreed extended repayment
plan. 

The
Company has been putting efforts into ramping up its production. In addition to the 10 trial production lines at Dubai Xinda, the Company
completed installing 45 production lines with 11,250 metric tons of annual production capacity at the end of November 2018, and an additional
30 production lines with 7,500 metric tons of annual production capacity are under construction. The Company estimates 22 production
lines will be put into production in the fourth quarter of 2021, 8 production lines will be put into production in the second quarter
of 2022, bringing total installed production capacity at Dubai Xinda to 21,250 metric tons, targeting high-end products for the overseas
market. If we are unable to expand our Dubai facility and the associated expansion in other areas, our financial performance may be affected. 

The
occurrence of the COVID-19 pandemic may negatively affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 

We
currently operate a substantial portion of our manufacturing facilities in China, and our corporate headquarters are located at Harbin,
Heilongjiang Province in China. Since January 2020, the rapid spread of COVID-19 has resulted in increased travel restrictions and disruption
and shutdown of businesses in China. In early 2020, we temporarily closed our manufacturing facilities and corporate offices in accordance
with the requirement of the Chinese government, and requested our employees to work remotely. As a result, our business, financial condition,
and results of operations may be adversely affected by the disruption of our business and limited access to our manufacturing facilities
caused by the outbreak of COVID-19 in the PRC. 

68 

The
overall impact of the outbreak of COVID-19 on our operations and financial results for the year of 2020 remains to be seen. Currently,
given the effective COVID-19 containment measures implemented in China, approximately 50 of employees of our administrative offices
had returned to work by the end of March 2020 and 90 returned to work by end of April. Our factories in Heilongjiang and Sichuan provinces
were running at 20 capacity utilization at the end of March, and approximately around 70 capacity utilization by the end of April,
and normal utilization rate by the end of May 2020. Our factory in Dubai was not impacted by the outbreak of COVID-19 during January
and February but only 20 employees from private sectors are now allowed to go to work due to the recent rise of COVID-19 cases in UAE. 

We
may further experience impacts from quarantines, market downturns and changes in customer behavior related to fears of the pandemic if
the coronavirus becomes widespread in any of our markets. Furthermore, if the coronavirus were to affect a significant number of our
workforce employed in our manufacturing facilities or corporate offices, we may experience delays or the inability to develop, produce
and deliver our products on a timely basis. In addition, one or more of our customers, distributors, service providers or suppliers may
experience financial distress, file for bankruptcy protection, go out of business, or suffer disruptions in their businesses due to the
COVID-19 outbreak, which may in turn adversely affect our business operations and financial condition. The extent to which the COVID-19
pandemic or any other health epidemic may affect our business and operations will depend on future developments, including new information
which may emerge concerning the severity of COVID-19 and the actions taken by governments and private businesses to contain the COVID-19
pandemic, among others, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted at this moment. As a result, the occurrence of the COVID-19
pandemic may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

The
withdrawal of preferential government policies and the tightening control over the Chinese automotive industry and automobile purchase
restrictions imposed in certain major cities may limit market demand for our products. 

In
2011, Chinese government terminated two preferential policies for its automotive industry: (1) vehicles with 1.6L or lower air displacement
were given a 50 discount in purchase tax and (2) vehicles sold in rural area were given a government subsidy. Since 2011, in order to
resolve the extreme traffic congestion, the Beijing government has been implementing the vehicle purchase quota policy, which limits
the maximum vehicles sold in Beijing per month to 20,000. Other cities which have begun to show signs of traffic congestion have also
begun to implement similar measures to control traffic congestion, including the limited automobile licenses policy implemented in Shanghai
and Tianjin and the imposition of congestion charges in Shenzhen. The termination of two nation-wide preferential policies negatively
affected consumer demand for new vehicles, and local restrictive measures over automobile purchases in major cities has resulted in slower
growth of sales for many years prior to the reintroduction of the preferential policies in September 2015. The national and local policies
over the Chinese automotive industry may continue to impact market demand for automobiles in 2019 and any future withdrawal of preferential
government policies and the further tightening of control and restrictions may eventually result in a reduction in our product sales. 

69 

The
Chinese automotive industry s growth is slowing after the rapid growth since 2000 and such slowdown may adversely affect the market
demand for our products. 

There
is a direct correlation between our business and automobile production volume and sales, which are dependent on economic policies and
market sentiment. The Chinese automotive industry had been rapidly growing for a decade prior to 2011. However, inflation, higher interest
rates, tighter bank lending, lifting of consumer subsidies and buying restrictions in congested cities all contributed to a more modest
environment since 2011. In order to stimulate the growth of the auto industry, on September 29, 2015, the Chinese government implemented
a tax incentive policy of 50 reduction of the sales tax for eligible purchase of vehicles with engines of 1.6 liters and less. This
helped the recovery of vehicle sales in China since the fourth quarter of 2015 and automobile sales volume growth rate reached to 13.7 
in 2016. However, following the automobile sales in China with a lower growth rate of 3.0 in 2017, Chinese government suspended the
above tax incentive policy and resumed vehicle purchase tax at a statutory rate of 10 effective from January 1, 2018. Furthermore, since
summer of 2018, Chinese macroeconomic conditions signaled weakening and deteriorated business conditions, automobile production and sales
in China further decreased by 7.5 and 8.2 , respectively, for twelve months of 2019 as compared to the same period of 2018, according
to China Association of Automobile Manufacturers. In March 2019, the Chinese government decided to reduce the financial subsidy policy
for the promotion and application of New Energy Vehicles with subsidies fallen more than 50 . There can be no assurance that the market
conditions, government policies and other factors leading to the current growth in demand for automobiles continue. Any significant decline
in demand for automobiles would directly and adversely affect demand for our products and hence our business, financial condition and
results of operations. 

A
large percentage of our sales revenue is derived from sales to a limited number of distributors and a limited number of customers, and
our business will suffer if sales to these customers decline. 

In
2014, we embarked our entry into the international market by primarily marketing long carbon chain PA plastic alloy and high-performance
modified PA66 products. After a successful trial production at our production base in Dubai in November 2018, we have established business
relationships with new customers in UAE and India, and shipped products to the end users in Europe and Southeast Asia. We have experienced
a delay in cash collection from a major customer in UAE. As of December 31, 2020, we provided an allowance of US 62.8 million
for the overdue accounts receivable from the major customer in UAE, as the customer failed to make payments under the agreed extended
repayment plan. 

We
may not be able to manage our business expansion effectively, which could harm our business. 

We
have expanded rapidly by making substantial investments in new markets and geographic regions. For example, on March 17, 2017, we entered
into a definitive agreement with People s Government of Shunqing District, Nanchong City of Sichuan Province for the production
of 300,000 metric tons of bio-composite materials and additive manufacturing and 20,000 metric tons of functional masterbatch, a high-end
color additive process in plastics manufacturing. On July 21, 2017, HLJ Xinda Group entered into three investment agreements with the
Management Committee of Harbin Economic- Technological Development Zone with respect to the industrial project for 300,000 metric tons
of biological composite materials, the industrial project for upgrading existing equipment for 100,000 metric tons of engineering plastics
and the industrial project for a 3D printing intelligent manufacture demonstration factory and a 3D printing display and experience cloud
factory. We anticipate continuous expansion in our business by entering into new markets serving different industries and geographic
regions. Such business expansion requires significant local management resources and personnel, knowledges and expertise in new markets
and geographies and building relationship with local suppliers and clients. In order to manage the planned business expansion, we will
be required to expand, train and manage our growing employee base. Furthermore, our management will be required to learn new markets
and geographies and build relationship with local suppliers and clients. We cannot assure you that our current resources, knowledges
and business relationships will be adequate to support our current expansion plans. If we are not successful in expanding our personnel,
acquiring knowledge and expertise in the new markets and geographies and building relationship with local suppliers and clients, our
business may be materially and adversely affected. 

70 

We
are dependent on a limited number of suppliers. While we have identified alternative sources for the materials and equipment we use,
a temporary disruption in our ability to procure necessary materials and equipment could adversely impact our sales in future periods. 

Materials
constitute a substantial part of the cost of our products. We seek to reduce the cost of raw materials by dealing with major suppliers.
During the year ended December 31, 2019, we purchased approximately 14.7 of our raw materials from one major supplier. We believe the
relationship with our suppliers is satisfactory and that alternative suppliers are available if relationships falter or existing suppliers
should become unable to keep up with our requirements. However, there can be no assurance that our current or future suppliers will be
able to meet our requirements on commercially reasonable terms or within scheduled delivery times. An interruption of our arrangements
with suppliers could cause a delay in the production of our products for timely delivery to distributors and customers, which could result
in a loss of sales in future periods. 

If
we are subject to product quality or liability claims relating to our products, we may incur significant litigation expenses and management
may have to devote significant time defending such claims, which if determined adversely to us, could require us to pay significant damage
awards. 

Although
we have adopted certain internal measures to supervise and examine the quality of our products, we may be subject to legal proceedings
and claims from time to time relating to our product quality. Consistent with rapid growth and expansion in many businesses, there are
risks associated with quality of newly developed products, especially during the initial stage and time and efforts needed to improve
our technology and techniques in order to supply quality and batch consistency to our new customers, in particular, high-end products
to overseas customers. The defense of these proceedings and claims could be both costly and time-consuming and significantly divert the
efforts and resources of our management. An adverse determination in any such proceedings could subject us to significant liability.
In addition, any such proceeding, even if ultimately determined in our favor, could damage our market reputation and prevent us from
maintaining or increasing sales and market share. Protracted litigation could also result in our customers or potential customers deferring
or limiting their purchase of our products. 

We
have limited insurance coverage on our assets in China and any uninsured loss or damage to our property, business disruption or litigation
may result in our incurring substantial costs and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and/or
liquidity. 

The
insurance industry in China is still at an early stage of development. Insurance companies in China offer limited insurance products.
Other than automobile insurance on certain vehicles and property and casualty insurance for some of our assets such as factories and
equipment we do not have insurance coverage on our other assets or inventories, nor do we have any business interruption, product liability
or litigation insurance for our operations in China. We have determined that the costs of insuring for these risks and the difficulties
associated with acquiring such insurance on commercially reasonable terms make it impractical for us to have such insurance. Any uninsured
loss or damage to property, business disruption or litigation may result in our incurring substantial costs and the diversion of our
resources, which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and/or liquidity. 

71 

SAFE
regulations relating to offshore investment activities by PRC individuals may increase our administrative burden and restrict our overseas
and cross-border investment activity. If our shareholders and beneficial owners who are PRC individuals fail to make any required applications,
registrations and filings under such regulations, we may be unable to distribute profits or become subject to liability under PRC laws,
and our ability to compensate our staff through equity compensation may be hindered and business operation may be adversely affected. 

The
State Administration of Foreign Exchange SAFE ), has promulgated several regulations, including the Circular on Relevant
Issues Relating to Domestic Resident s Investment and Financing and Roundtrip Investment through Special Purpose Vehicles, or SAFE
Circular No. 37, in July 2014 that requires PRC residents or entities to register with SAFE or its local branch in connection with their
establishment or control of an offshore entity established for the purpose of overseas investment or financing. In addition, such PRC
residents or entities must update their SAFE registrations when the offshore special purpose vehicle undergoes material events relating
to any change of basic information (including change of such PRC citizens or residents, name and operation term), increases or decreases
in investment amount, transfers or exchanges of shares, or mergers or divisions. SAFE Circular 37 is issued to replace the Notice on
Relevant Issues Concerning Foreign Exchange Administration for PRC Residents Engaging in Financing and Roundtrip Investments via Overseas
Special Purpose Vehicles, or SAFE Circular No. 75. 

We
have requested our shareholders and beneficial owners who are PRC residents to make the necessary applications and filings as required
under these regulations and under any implementation rules or approval practices that may be established under these regulations. As
of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, Mr. Han, our Chief Executive Officer, has registered his beneficial ownerships in China
XD and XD Engineering Plastics Company Limited XD Engineering Plastics respectively with local SAFE in accordance with
Circular No. 37. However, we cannot assure you that the rest of our shareholders and beneficial owners who are PRC individuals have timely
updated their registrations with SAFE in accordance with SAFE regulations. The failure or inability of our PRC shareholders and beneficial
owners make any required registrations may subject us to fines and legal sanctions, restrict our overseas or cross-border investment
activities, limit our PRC subsidiaries ability to make distributions or pay dividends or affect our ownership structure, as a
result of which our acquisition strategy and business operations and our ability to distribute profits to you could be materially and
adversely affected. 

On
December 25, 2006, the People s Bank of China issued the Administration Measures of Foreign Exchange Matters for Individuals, which
set forth the respective requirements for foreign exchange transactions by individuals (both PRC and non-PRC citizens) under the current
account or the capital account, and the corresponding Implementing Rules were issued by SAFE on January 5, 2007, both of these regulations
became effective on February 1, 2007. According to these regulations, all foreign exchange matters relating to employee stock holding
plans, share option plans or similar plans of an overseas publicly-listed company in which PRC citizens will participate require approval
from SAFE or its authorized branch. 

In
February 2012, SAFE promulgated the Notice on Issues Concerning the Foreign Exchange Administration for Domestic Individuals Participating
in Stock Incentive Plan of Overseas Publicly-Listed Company, or the New Stock Option Rules, which replaced and substituted the Application
Procedure of Foreign Exchange Administration for Domestic Individuals Participating in Employee Stock Holding Plan or Stock Option Plan
of Overseas-Listed Company, or the Stock Option Rule. According to the New Stock Option Rules, if a PRC resident participates in any
stock incentive plan of an overseas publicly-listed company, a qualified PRC domestic agent, which could be a PRC subsidiary of such
overseas publicly-listed company or another qualified institution selected by such PRC subsidiary, among other things, must file on behalf
of such participant an application with SAFE to conduct the SAFE registration with respect to such stock incentive plan and obtain approval
for an annual allowance with respect to the purchase of foreign exchange in connection with the exercise or sale of stock options or
stock such participant holds. Such participants must also retain an overseas entrusted institution to handle matters in connection with
their exercise of stock options, the purchase and sale of corresponding stocks or interests and fund transfers. In addition, the qualified
PRC domestic agent is required to amend the SAFE registration with respect to the stock incentive plan if there is any material change
to the stock incentive plan, the qualified PRC domestic agent or the overseas entrusted institution or other material changes. Such participant s
foreign exchange income received from the sale of stock and dividends distributed by the overseas publicly-listed company must be fully
remitted into a specific domestic foreign currency account opened and managed by such qualified PRC domestic agent first, before distribution
to such participants. 

72 

We
are an offshore listed company and, as a result, any Chinese employee or foreign employee of our PRC subsidiaries, who resides in PRC
more than one year consecutively, including without limitation, directors, supervisors and other senior management staffs of our PRC
subsidiaries, who have been granted share options or shares under our existing share incentive plan, are subject to the New Stock Option
Rules. We completed the application with local SAFE in Heilongjiang on December 16, 2013, obtaining a registration in respect of our
2009 Stock Option/Stock Issuance Plan in accordance with the New Stock Option Rules and are in the process of applying relevant registration
for our 2020 Stock Option/Stock Issuance Plan. If our PRC subsidiaries or their qualified employees fail to comply with these regulations,
including the New Stock Option Rules, they may be subject to fines or other legal sanctions imposed by SAFE or other Chinese government
authorities. In that case, our ability to compensate our employees, directors, supervisors and other senior management staffs through
equity compensations may be hindered and our business operations may be adversely affected. 

Under
the PRC EIT Law, we and/or Favor Sea (BVI) may be classified as a resident enterprise of the PRC. Such classification could
result in tax consequences to us, our non-PRC resident shareholders and Favor Sea (BVI). 

On
March 16, 2007, the National People s Congress approved and promulgated the PRC Enterprise Income Tax Law EIT Law ),
which took effect on January 1, 2008. Under the EIT Law, enterprises are classified as resident enterprises and non-resident enterprises.
An enterprise established outside of China with de facto management bodies within China is considered a resident
enterprise, and subject to the uniform 25 enterprise income tax rate on global income. The implementing rules of the EIT Law
define de facto management bodies as a managing body that in practice exercises substantial and overall management
and control over the production and operations, personnel, accounting, and properties of the enterprise; however, due to the short
history of the EIT Law and lack of applicable legal precedents, it remains unclear whether the PRC tax authorities would deem our managing
body as being located within China, or whether we or our non-PRC subsidiaries would be deemed as resident enterprises of the PRC. 

If
the PRC tax authorities determine that we, Favor Sea Limited, a British Virgin Islands corporation Favor Sea (BVI) and/or
Xinda Holding (HK) Company Limited, a Hong Kong corporation Xinda HK ), are resident enterprises for PRC
enterprise income tax purposes, a number of PRC tax consequences could follow. We, Favor Sea (BVI) and/or Xinda HK may be subject to
enterprise income tax at a rate of 25 on our, Favor Sea (BVI) s and/or Xinda HK s worldwide taxable income, as well as PRC
enterprise income tax reporting obligations. However, under the EIT Law and its implementing rules, dividends paid between qualified
resident enterprises are exempt from enterprise income tax. As a result, if we, Favor Sea (BVI) and Xinda HK are treated as PRC
 qualified resident enterprises, all dividends paid from HLJ Xinda Group to Xinda HK, from Xinda HK to Favor Sea (BVI) and
from Favor Sea (BVI) to us may be exempt from PRC tax. Otherwise, all dividends paid from HLJ Xinda Group to Xinda HK, from Xinda HK
to Favor Sea (BVI) and from Favor Sea (BVI) to us may be subject to withholding tax under the EIT Law and its implementing rules. 

73 

On
April 22, 2009, State Administration of Taxation SAT enacted Circular of the State Administration of Taxation
on Issues Concerning the Identification of Chinese-Controlled Overseas Registered Enterprises as Resident Enterprises in Accordance With
the Actual Standards of Organizational Management . On July 27, 2011, SAT enacted Announcement of the State Administration
of Taxation on Printing and Distributing the Administrative Measures for Income Tax on Chinese-controlled Resident Enterprises Incorporated
Overseas (Trial Implementation) . Under those two rules, either the enterprises may request the PRC tax authorities to determine
their resident enterprises identity or the tax authority may investigate and determine an enterprise s identity.
The target enterprises under those two rules are foreign registered companies controlled by the PRC companies, however, the PRC tax authority
may determine if a foreign registered company controlled by the PRC individual(s) is a resident enterprise or not by reference
to those two rules. 

Under
the EIT Law and its implementation rules, dividends payable by a foreign-invested enterprise in China to its shareholders that are non-resident
enterprises are subject to a 10 withholding tax, unless such shareholders jurisdiction of incorporation has a tax treaty
with China that provides for a preferential arrangement. Pursuant to the Notice of the SAT on Issuing the Table of Tax Rates on Dividends
in Treatises, or Notice 112, which was issued on January 29, 2008, the Arrangement between the PRC and the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region on the Avoidance of Double Taxation and Prevention of Fiscal Evasion, or the Double Taxation Arrangement (Hong Kong), which became
effective on December 8, 2006, such withholding tax may be lowered to 5 if the PRC enterprise is at least 25 directly held by a Hong
Kong enterprise. In October 2009, the SAT further issued the Notice on How to Understand and Determine the Beneficial Owners 
in Tax Treaties, or Circular 601. According to Circular 601, non-resident enterprises that cannot provide valid supporting documents
as beneficial owners may not be approved to enjoy tax treaty benefits, and beneficial owners refer to individuals,
companies or other organizations which are normally engaged in substantive operations. These rules also set forth certain adverse factors
on the recognition of a beneficial owner. Specifically, they expressly exclude a conduit company that is
usually established for the purposes of avoiding or reducing tax obligations or transferring or accumulating profits and not engaged
in substantive operations such as manufacturing, sales or management, from being a beneficial owner. As a result, if we
are treated as PRC non-resident enterprises under the EIT Law, then dividends from HLJ Xinda Group (assuming such dividends
were considered sourced within the PRC) paid to us through Xinda HK may be subject to a reduced withholding tax at a rate of 5 if Xinda
HK is determined to be Hong Kong tax residents and are considered to be beneficial owners that are generally engaged in
substantive business activities and entitled to treaty benefits under the Double Taxation Arrangement (Hong Kong). Otherwise, we may
not be able to enjoy the preferential withholding tax rate of 5 under the tax arrangement and therefore be subject to withholding tax
at a rate of 10 with respect to dividends to be paid by HLJ Xinda Group (assuming such dividends were considered sourced within the
PRC) to us through Xinda HK. Any such taxes on dividends could materially reduce the amount of dividends, if any, we could pay to our
shareholders. 

However,
if we are deemed as a resident enterprise, the new resident enterprise classification could result in a situation
in which an up to 10 PRC tax is imposed on dividends we pay to our non-PRC shareholders that are not PRC tax resident enterprises .
In such event, we may be required to withhold an up to 10 PRC tax on any dividends paid to non-PRC resident enterprise shareholders.
Our non-PRC resident enterprise shareholders also may be responsible for paying PRC tax at a rate of 10 on any gain realized from the
sale or transfer of our ordinary shares in certain circumstances if such income is considered PRC-sourced income by relevant tax authorities.
We would not, however, have an obligation to withhold PRC tax with respect to such gain. 

74 

We
(or a foreign investor) may become at risk of being taxed or imposed a penalty under Announcement 7 and may be required to expend valuable
resources to comply with Announcement 7 or to establish that we (or such foreign investor) should not be taxed under Announcement 7,
which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations (or such foreign investor s investment
in us). 

On
December 15, 2009, the State Administration of Taxation SAT released the Notice on Strengthening Administration of Enterprise
Income Tax for Share Transfers by Non-PRC Resident Enterprises Circular 698 that reinforces the taxation of non-listed
equity transfers by non-resident enterprises through overseas holding vehicles. Circular 698 is retroactively effective from January
1, 2008. Subsequently SAT also released the Announcement on Several Issues Related to Enterprise Income Tax for Indirect Asset Transfer
by Non-PRC Resident Enterprises Announcement 7 ), effective from February 3, 2015, which in part supersedes Circular 698. 

Announcement
7 addresses indirect share transfer as well as other issues. According to Announcement 7, if a non-PRC resident enterprise transfers
the equity interests of or similar rights or interests in overseas companies which directly or indirectly own PRC taxable assets through
an arrangement without a reasonable commercial purpose, but rather to avoid PRC corporate income tax, the transaction will be re-characterized
and treated as a direct transfer of PRC taxable assets subject to PRC corporate income tax. Announcement 7 specifies certain factors
that should be considered in determining whether an indirect transfer has a reasonable commercial purpose. Since Announcement 7 has a
short history, there is uncertainty as to its application and in particular, the interpretation of the term reasonable commercial
purpose. 

Announcement
7 further provides that, the entity which has the obligation to pay the consideration for the transfer to the transferring shareholders
has the obligation to withhold any PRC corporate income tax that is due. If the transferring shareholders do not pay corporate income
tax that is due for a transfer and the entity which has the obligation to pay the consideration does not withhold the tax due, the PRC
tax authorities may impose a penalty on the entity that so fails to withhold, which may be relieved or exempted from the withholding
obligation and any resulting penalty under certain circumstances if it reports such transfer to the PRC tax authorities. 

75 

PRC
regulations relating to mergers and acquisitions of domestic enterprises by foreign investors may increase the administrative burden
we face and create regulatory uncertainties. 

On
August 8, 2006, six PRC regulatory agencies, namely, the PRC Ministry of Commerce, or MOFCOM, the State Assets Supervision and Administration
Commission, or SASAC, the State Administration for Taxation, the State Administration for Industry and Commerce, the China Securities
Regulatory Commission, or CSRC, and SAFE, jointly adopted the Regulations on Mergers and Acquisitions of Domestic Enterprises by Foreign
Investors, or the M A Rule, which became effective on September 8, 2006. The M A Rule purports, among other things, (i) to require
any PRC company, enterprise or individual that intends to merge or acquire its domestic affiliated company in the name of an overseas
company which it lawfully established or controls, to apply for MOFCOM s examination on and approval for the proposed merger or
acquisition; and (ii) to require SPVs, formed for overseas listing purposes through acquisitions of PRC domestic companies and controlled
directly or indirectly by PRC companies or individuals, to obtain the approval of CSRC prior to publicly listing their securities on
an overseas stock exchange. However, there are substantial uncertainties regarding the interpretation, application and enforcement of
these rules, and CSRC has yet to promulgate any written provisions or formally to declare or state whether the overseas listing of a
PRC-related company structured similar to ours is subject to the approval of CSRC. As a result, we are not sure whether the M A Rule
would require us or our entities in China to obtain the approval from either MOFCOM or CSRC or any other regulatory agencies in connection
with the transaction contemplated by the share transfer contracts which were entered into between Mr. Jie Han, Mr. Qingwei Ma and Xinda
Holding (HK) Company Limited on June 26, 2008, the transaction contemplated in the Agreement and Plan of Merger entered into by and among
NB Telecom, Favor Sea (BVI) and the shareholders of Favor Sea (BVI) on December 24, 2008 (detailed description of both of the two aforesaid
transactions and relevant contracts can be found in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2009, filed
on April 14, 2010) the adoption and performance of the option agreement dated May 16, 2008 between Ms. Piao and Mr. Han. 

Further,
in the event MOFCOM or CSRC deems it necessary for us to obtain its approval prior to our entry into the aforesaid agreements, we could
be subject to severe penalties. The M A Rule does not stipulate the specific penalty terms, therefore, we are unable to determine
what penalties we may face, and how such penalties may affect our business operations or future strategy. 

Our
business will suffer if we cannot obtain or maintain necessary permits or approvals. 

Under
PRC laws, we are required to obtain from various PRC governmental authorities certain permits and licenses in relation to the operation
of our business. These permits and licenses are subject to periodic renewal and/or reassessment by the relevant PRC government authorities
and the standards of compliance required in relation thereto may from time to time be subject to change. We cannot assure you that we
can always obtain, maintain or renew all the permits and licenses in a timely manner. Additionally, any changes in compliance standards,
or any new laws or regulations that may prohibit or render it more restrictive for us to conduct our business or increase our compliance
costs may adversely affect our operations or profitability. Any failure by us to obtain, maintain or renew necessary licenses, permits
and approvals, could subject us to fines and other penalties and limit the business we could conduct, which could have a material adverse
effect on the operation of our business. In addition, we may not be able to carry on business without such permits and licenses being
renewed and/or reassessed. 

Pursuant
to PRC laws and regulations, construction or expansion of a building or a production facility is subject to various permits and approvals
from different government authorities. In connection with the construction of HLJ Xinda Group s factory and production facilities,
which has already been completed and put into operation, we obtained a project approval from Administration Committee of Harbin Economic
and Technological High-tech Development Zone and an approval for the environmental impact assessment report on the construction
project of HLJ Xinda Group in 2003. In connection with the construction of Sichuan Xinda Group s factory and production facilities
which has been partially completed in the second half of 2016, we obtained the project approvals from Bureau of Development and Reform
of Shunqing District, Nanchong City in 2013 and 2015, respectively. In connection with the Phase II construction of AL Composites which
has been completed by the middle of 2016, we obtained the project approval from Engineering Project Management Department, UAE
region Economic Zones World EZW in June 2015, and the building permit from Department of Planning Development,
Ports, Customs Free Zone Corporation, Government of Dubai in September 2015. In July 2017, HLJ Xinda Group launched new industrial
development project with the Management Committee of Harbin Economic - Technological Development Zone for upgrading existing equipment
for 100,000 metric tons of engineering plastics and building 300,000 metric tons of biological composite materials, an industrial project
for a 3D printing intelligent manufacture demonstration factory and a 3D printing display and experience cloud factory. On December 21,
2017 and February 7, 2018, we got building and planning permit from Harbin Municipal Urban and Rural Bureau, respectively. Failure to
obtain all necessary approvals/permits may subject us to various penalties, such as fines or being required to vacate from the facilities
where we currently operate our business. 

76 

Increased
environmental regulation in China could increase our costs of operation. 

Certain
processes utilized in the production of modified plastics result in toxic by-products. To date, the Chinese government has imposed only
limited regulation on the production of these by-products, and enforcement of the regulations has been sparse. Recently, however, there
is a substantial increase in focus on the Chinese environment, which has inspired considerable new regulation. Because we plan to export
plastics to the U.S. and Europe in coming years, we have developed certain safeguards in our manufacturing processes to assure compliance
with the environmental protection standard ISO/TS16949 Quality Assurance Standard, the European Union s RoHS Standards and Germany s
PAHs Standards. Furthermore, have applied for the U.S. s UL Safety Certification, ISO14001 Environmental Management System Certification
and OHSAS18001 Occupational Health Management System Certification This compliance regimen brings us into compliance with all Chinese
environmental regulations. Additional regulation, however, could increase our cost of doing business, which would impair our profitability. 

Recent
joint statement by the SEC and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), or the PCAOB, proposed rule changes submitted
by Nasdaq, and the newly enacted Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act all call for additional and more stringent criteria to be
applied to emerging market companies upon assessing the qualification of their auditors, especially the non-U.S. auditors who are not
inspected by the PCAOB. These developments could add uncertainties to the trading of our common stock on U.S. stock exchanges, including
the possibility that our securities can be delisted if the PCAOB cannot inspect or fully investigate our auditor. 

On
April 21, 2020, the SEC Chairman and PCAOB Chairman, along with other senior SEC staff, released a joint statement highlighting the risks
associated with investing in companies based in or have substantial operations in emerging markets including China. The joint statement
emphasized the risks associated with lack of access for the PCAOB to inspect auditors and audit work papers in China and higher risks
of fraud in emerging markets. 

On
May 18, 2020, Nasdaq filed three proposals with the SEC to (1) apply minimum offering size requirement for companies primarily operating
in Restrictive Market, (2) adopt a new requirement relating to the qualification of management or board of director for
Restrictive Market companies, and (3) apply additional and more stringent criteria to an applicant or listed company based on the qualifications
of the company s auditor. 

On
June 4, 2020, the U.S. President issued a memorandum ordering the President s working group on financial markets to submit a report
to the President within 60 days of the date of the memorandum that should include recommendations for actions that can be taken by the
executive branch and by the SEC or PCAOB to enforce U.S. regulatory requirements on Chinese companies listed on U.S. stock exchanges
and their audit firms. However, it remains unclear what further actions, if any, the U.S. executive branch, the SEC, and PCAOB will take
to address the problem. 

77 

On
August 6, 2020, the President s working group released a report recommending that the SEC take steps to implement the five recommendations
outlined in the report. In particular, to address companies from jurisdictions that do not provide the PCAOB with sufficient access to
fulfill its statutory mandate, the President s working group recommended enhanced listing standards on U.S. stock exchanges. This
would require, as a condition to initial and continued exchange listing, PCAOB access to work papers of the principal audit firm for
the audit of the listed company. Companies unable to satisfy this standard as a result of governmental restrictions on access to audit
work papers and practices in their jurisdiction may satisfy this standard by providing a co-audit from an audit firm with comparable
resources and experience where the PCAOB determines it has sufficient access to audit work papers and practices to conduct an appropriate
inspection of the co-audit firm. The report permits the new listing standards to provide for a transition period until January 1, 2022
for listed companies, but would apply immediately to new listings once the necessary rulemakings and/or standard-setting are effective. 

On
August 10, 2020, the SEC announced that the SEC Chairman had directed the SEC staff to prepare proposals in response to the report of
the President s working group, and that the SEC was soliciting public comments and information with respect to the development
of these proposals. 

On
May 20, 2020, the U.S. Senate passed the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act, or the Act. The Act was approved by the U.S. House
of Representatives on December 2, 2020. On December 18, 2020, the Act was signed into public law by the President of the United States.
In essence, the Act requires the SEC to prohibit foreign companies from listing securities on U.S. securities exchanges if a company
retains a foreign accounting firm that cannot be inspected by the PCAOB for three consecutive years, beginning in 2021. On March 24,
2021, the SEC announced that it had adopted interim final amendments to implement congressionally mandated submission and disclosure
requirements of the Act. The interim final amendments will apply to registrants that the SEC identifies as having filed an annual report
on Forms 10-K, 20-F, 40-F or N-CSR with an audit report issued by a registered public accounting firm that is located in a foreign jurisdiction
and that the PCAOB has determined it is unable to inspect or investigate completely because of a position taken by an authority in that
jurisdiction. 

The
enactment of the Act and any additional actions, proceedings, or new rules resulting from these efforts to increase U.S. regulatory access
to audit information could cause investors uncertainty for affected issuers and the price of our shares could be adversely affected,
and we could face regulatory sanctions if we and our auditor are unable to meet the PCAOB inspection requirement. 

The
lack of access to the PCAOB inspection in China prevents the PCAOB from fully evaluating audits and quality control procedures of the
auditors based in China. As a result, investors may be deprived of the benefits of such PCAOB inspections. The inability of the PCAOB
to conduct inspections of auditors in China makes it more difficult to evaluate the effectiveness of these accounting firm s audit
procedures or quality control procedures as compared to auditors outside of China that are subject to the PCAOB inspections. 

Our
auditor, the independent registered public accounting firm that issues the audit report, as an auditor of companies that are traded publicly
in the United States and a firm registered with the PCAOB, is subject to laws in the United States, pursuant to which the PCAOB conducts
regular inspections to assess its compliance with the applicable professional standards. Our auditor is headquartered in Lakewood, Colorado
and has been inspected by the PCAOB on a regular basis with the last inspection in 2019 with inspection report available in November
2021. However, the recent developments would add uncertainties to the trading of our shares on U.S. stock exchanges, including
the possibility that our securities can be delisted if the PCAOB cannot inspect or fully investigate our auditor, and we cannot assure
you whether Nasdaq or regulatory authorities would apply additional and more stringent criteria to us after considering the effectiveness
of our auditor s audit procedures and quality control procedures, adequacy of personnel and training, or sufficiency of resources,
geographic reach, or experience as it relates to our audit. 

78 

The
disclosures in our reports and other filings with the SEC and our other public pronouncements are not subject to the scrutiny of any
regulatory bodies in China. Accordingly, our public disclosure should be reviewed in light of the fact that no governmental agency that
is located in China where substantially all of our operations and business are located has conducted any due diligence on our operations
or reviewed or cleared any of our disclosure. 

We
are regulated by the SEC and our reports and other filings with the SEC are subject to SEC review in accordance with the rules and regulations
promulgated by the SEC under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act and the Exchange Act of 1934,
as amended (the Exchange Act ). Unlike public reporting companies whose operations are located primarily in the United States,
however, substantially all of our operations are located in China. Since substantially all of our operations and business takes place
in China, it may be more difficult for the Staff of the SEC to overcome the geographic and cultural obstacles that are present when reviewing
our disclosure. These same obstacles are not present for similar companies whose operations or business take place entirely or primarily
in the United States. Furthermore, our SEC reports and other disclosure and public pronouncements are not subject to the review or scrutiny
of any PRC regulatory authority. For example, the disclosure in our SEC reports and other filings are not subject to the review of the
CSRC, a PRC regulator that is tasked with oversight of the capital markets in China. Accordingly, you should review our SEC reports,
filings and our other public pronouncements with the understanding that no local regulator has done any due diligence on our company
and with the understanding that none of our SEC reports, other filings or any of our other public pronouncements has been reviewed or
otherwise scrutinized by any local regulator. 

Our
former independent registered public accounting firm may be temporarily suspended from practicing before the SEC if unable to continue
to satisfy SEC investigation requests in the future. If a delay in completion of our audit process occurs as a result, we could be unable
to timely file certain reports with the SEC, which may lead to the delisting of our stock. 

The
vast majority of our sales are to customers in China, and we have all of our operations in China. Like many U.S. companies with significant
operations in China, our former independent registered public accounting firm is located in China. 

On
January 22, 2014, Judge Cameron Elliot, an SEC administrative law judge, issued an initial decision suspending the Chinese member firms
of the Big Four accounting firms, including our former independent registered public accounting firm, from practicing before
the SEC for six months. In February 2014, the initial decision was appealed. While under appeal and in February 2015, the Chinese member
firms of Big Four accounting firms reached a settlement with the SEC. As part of the settlement, each of the Chinese member
firms of Big Four accounting firms agreed to settlement terms that include a censure, undertakings to make a payment to
the SEC, procedures and undertakings as to future requests for documents by the SEC, and possible additional proceedings and remedies
should those undertakings not be adhered to. 

If
the settlement terms are not adhered to, Chinese member firms of Big Four accounting firms may be suspended from practicing
before the SEC which could in turn delay the timely filing of our financial statements with the SEC. Although we have engaged another
qualified independent auditor to replace our former independent registered public accounting firm, any delay in such transition could
cause a delinquency in our filings with the SEC and may result in NASDAQ initiating procedures, which could adversely harm our reputation
and have other material adverse effects on our overall growth and prospects. 

79 

We
may fail to develop and maintain an effective system of internal controls over financial reporting. As a result, we may not be able to
accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud and current and potential shareholders could lose confidence in the integrity
of our financial reports, which could harm our business and the trading price of our common stock. 

Prior
to our listing on the US stock exchange, we were a private company with all business operations within China. Our accounting and reporting
system was designed to satisfy local statutory requirements and internal management needs. Since we became a public company, our business
has grown significantly over the years. Management concluded that our internal controls over financial reporting were ineffective as
of December 31, 2020, due to one material weakness which relates to the lack of sufficient accounting and financial reporting personnel
to formalize certain key controls over the financial reporting process and report financial information based on US GAAP and SEC reporting
requirements. 

Our
management is committed to strengthening our internal controls and complying with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 SOX
404 ). Since 2014, when we were required to comply with SOX 404, our efforts to improve our internal control over financial reporting
include: (1) our accounting staff obtained external training of U.S. GAAP and SEC reporting by qualified entities, (2) having hired two
third-party SOX 404 compliance consultants to help us improve our internal control system, (3) continuing to seek senior qualified people
with requisite expertise and knowledge to help improve our internal control procedures, (4) having adopted internal policies and approval
and supervision procedures governing financial reporting, (5) having adopted procedures to evaluate and assess performance of directors,
officers and employees of the Company, and (6) continuing to hold internal meetings, discussions and seminars periodically to review
and improve our internal control procedures. 

However,
we cannot be certain that these measures we have undertaken will ensure that we will develop and maintain adequate controls over our
financial processes and reporting in the future. Furthermore, if we are able to rapidly grow our business, the internal controls that
we will need may become more complex, and significantly more resources may be required to ensure our internal controls remain effective.
Failure to implement required controls, or difficulties encountered in their implementation, could harm our operating results or cause
us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. If we fail to develop and maintain an effective internal control system, our stockholders
and other potential investors may lose confidence in our business operations and the integrity of our financial statements, and may be
discouraged from future investments in our company, which may delay or hinder any future business development or expansion plans if we
are unable to raise funds in future financings, and our current stockholders may choose to dispose of the shares of common stock they
own in our company, which could have a negative impact on our stock price. In addition, non-compliance with SOX 404 could subject us
to a variety of administrative sanctions, including the suspension of trading of our stock on the NASDAQ Global Market, ineligibility
for listing on other national securities exchanges, and the inability of registered broker-dealers to make a market in our common stock,
which could further reduce our stock price. 

We
may be subject to or be liable for U.S. taxes, interest and penalties. 

On
December 22, 2017, the U.S. enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Act ), which significantly changed U.S. tax law. The
Act lowered the Company s U.S. statutory federal income tax rate from 35 to 21 effective January 1, 2018, while also imposing
a tax on deemed repatriation of deferred foreign income. The Act also created a new minimum tax on certain future foreign earnings. 

80 

The
Company recorded a charge of approximately 71.0 million for the tax on deemed repatriation to the United States based on accumulated
earnings in the Company s consolidated statement of comprehensive income for the year ended December 31, 2017. As of December 31,
2018, the Company finalized the calculations and tax positions used in the analysis of the impact of the Tax Act in consideration of
proposed regulations and other guidance issued during 2018, and no adjustment was made to the provisional amount. The charge for deemed
repatriation was payable by the Company over an eight-year period commencing April 2018. 

As
of December 31, 20120 for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the Company owed U.S. federal income taxes of US 6,407 other than
the above repatriation tax. There can be no assurance that the Internal Revenue Service IRS will not assess additional
U.S. federal income taxes, interest and penalties on us. 

Our
inability or failure to protect our intellectual property rights may significantly and materially impact our business, financial condition
and results of operations. 

Protection
of our proprietary processes, methods and other technology is important to our business. We generally rely on a combination of the patent,
trademark and copyright laws of the PRC and laws protecting trade secret in the PRC, as well as licenses and non-disclosure and confidentiality
agreements, to protect our intellectual property rights. The patent, trademark and copyright laws of the PRC, as well as laws protecting
trade secret in the PRC, may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the U.S. 

Failure
to protect our intellectual property rights may result in the loss of valuable proprietary technologies. Additionally, some of our technologies
are not covered by any patent or patent application and, even if a patent application has been filed, it may not result in an issued
patent. If patents are issued to us, those patents may not provide meaningful protection against competitors or against competitive technologies.
In addition, upon the expiration of patents issued to us, we will be unable to prevent our competitors from using or introducing products
using the formerly-patented technology. As a result, we may be faced with increased competition and our results of operations may be
adversely affected. We cannot assure you that our intellectual property rights will not be challenged, invalidated, circumvented or rendered
unenforceable. 

We
also rely upon unpatented proprietary manufacturing expertise, continuing technological innovation and other trade secrets to develop
and maintain our competitive position. While we generally enter into confidentiality/non-disclosure agreements with our employees and
third parties to protect our intellectual property, we cannot assure you that our confidentiality/non-disclosure agreements will not
be breached, that they will provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets and proprietary manufacturing expertise or that adequate
remedies will be available in the event of an unauthorized use or disclosure of our trade secrets or manufacturing expertise. 

Our
intellectual property rights may be challenged or infringed upon by third parties or we may be unable to maintain, renew or enter into
new license agreements that are important to our business with third-party owners of intellectual property on reasonable terms. We could
also face patent infringement claims from our competitors or others alleging that our processes or products infringe on their proprietary
technologies. If we are found to be infringing on the proprietary technology of others, we may be liable for damages, and we may be required
to change our processes, to redesign our products partially or completely, to pay to use the technology of others or to stop using certain
technologies or producing the infringing product(s) entirely. Even if we ultimately prevail in an infringement suit, the existence of
the suit could prompt customers to switch to products that are not the subject of infringement suits. We may not prevail in any intellectual
property litigation and such litigation may result in significant legal costs or otherwise impede our ability to produce and distribute
key products.

We
may be unable to renew the leases for our factories on acceptable terms or these leases may be terminated . 

As
of December 31, 20120 HLJ Xinda Group operated three separate factories located at 9 Qinling Road (the Qinling Road Factory ),
9 North Dalian Road (the Dalian Road Factory and 9 Jiangnan First Road (the Jiangnan Road Factory ), respectively.
HLJ Xinda Group owns the titles to the land and premises of the Qinling Road Factory. HLJ Xinda Group leases the land and premises of
the Dalian Road Factory from Harbin Xinda High-Tech Co., Ltd Xinda High-Tech ). HLJ Xinda Group is in the process of acquiring
the titles to the land and premises at Jiangnan Road Factory. The Company expects the title transfer to be completed by the end of third
quarter of 2021. HLJ Xinda Group s leases was renewed to be expired on December 31, 2020. If we are unable to renew our lease on
acceptable terms in due course or acquire the titles to the land and premises at Jiangnan Road Factory or if our lease is terminated
by the lessor unilaterally for the Dalian Road Factory: 

we may be unable to find a new property with the amenities and in the location we require for our factories, which may result in a factory
closure; 

we may have to relocate to a less desirable location; 

we may have to relocate to a location with facilities that do not meet our requirements; 

our factories may experience significant disruption in operations and, as a result, we may be unable to produce products during the period
of disruption. 

Any
of these events may materially and adversely affect our business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition. 

Our
ability to sell our products at current profit margin is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, which are beyond our control;
in particular, we may not be able to reflect raw material cost increases in the price of our products. 

Our
ability to sell our products at current profit margin is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, which are beyond our control.
For example, general slow-down in the Chinese or world economy may lessen the demand for our products, and we may be forced to sell our
products at a lower price. 

Particularly,
we may not be able to pass through raw material cost increases to our customers on a timely basis and reflect such increases in the price
of our products. We purchase various plastic resins, which are derived from petroleum or natural gas, to produce our modified plastics
products. Cost of raw materials made up a vast majority of our cost of revenues in 2020 and 2019. The market prices of plastic resins
may fluctuate due to changes in supply and demand conditions in that industry. Any shortage in supply of or significant increase in demand
for plastic resins and additives may result in higher market prices and thereby increase our cost of revenues, and we may not be able
to pass on increases in the prices of raw materials to our customers. Under the terms of our distributor agreements, we will only be
able to increase the sales prices for our products if the cost of our raw materials increases by more than 5 on a cumulative basis.
As a result, we may not be able to adjust our selling prices in a timely manner, and our inability to increase the selling prices of
our products sold during the period in which the cumulative increases of the cost of our raw materials is less than 5 may reduce our
profitability. Furthermore, other adverse developments such as increased competition may not allow us to pass through cost increases
to our distributors at all. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our margins, results of operations and financial
condition. When expanding into new regions, we have taken and may continue to take marketing initiatives from time to time to offer sales
incentives, including discounts, to increase market share. Such initiatives and measures have put and may continue to put pressure on
our margins. 

82 

Our
assets are primarily located in China. So any dividends or proceeds from liquidation are subject to the approval of the relevant Chinese
government agencies, and you may face difficulties in protecting your interests. 

Our
assets are primarily located inside China. Under the laws governing foreign investment entities in China, dividend distribution and liquidation
are allowed but subject to respective administrative procedures under the Foreign Investment Law and relevant laws and rules. Any dividend
payment will be subject to the decision of the Board of Directors and be subject to foreign exchange rules governing such repatriation.
Any liquidation is subject to the decision of the highest authority of the company, the relevant government agency s approval and
supervision (including but not limited to the local branch of MOFCOM), as well as the whole process of liquidation under PRC laws and
regulations, including without limitation personnel resettlement, assets disposition, settlement of debts and creditor s rights
as well as deregistration, which process could be very time-consuming and complex. Since the dividend distribution procedure is subject
to foreign exchange rules governing such repatriation, risks may arise for our investors when HLJ Xinda Group pays dividend to us through
Xinda HK. Furthermore, the liquidation procedure is a complex and time consuming procedures subject to government approvals, additional
risks and costs may arise for our investors in the process. 

In
addition, we conduct substantially all of our business operations in China, and substantially all of our directors and senior management
are based in China. The SEC, U.S. Department of Justice and other authorities often have substantial difficulties in bringing and enforcing
actions against non-U.S. companies and non-U.S. persons, including company directors and officers, in certain emerging markets, including
China. Additionally, our public shareholders may have limited rights and few practical remedies in emerging markets where we operate,
as shareholder claims that are common in the United States, including class action securities law and fraud claims, generally are difficult
or impossible to pursue as a matter of law or practicality in many emerging markets, including China. 

As
a result of all of the above, our public shareholders may have more difficulty in protecting their interests in the face of actions taken
by management, members of the board of directors or controlling shareholders than they would as public shareholders of a company operated
in the United States. 

Governmental
control of currency conversions may affect the value of your investment. 

A
majority of our revenue are earned in Renminbi. Any future restrictions on currency conversions may limit our ability to use revenue
generated in Renminbi to make dividend or other payments in U.S. dollars. Although the PRC government introduced regulations in 1996
to allow greater convertibility of the Renminbi for current account transactions, significant restrictions still remain, including primarily
the restriction that foreign-invested enterprises like us may buy, sell or remit foreign currencies only after providing valid commercial
documents at a PRC banks specifically authorized to conduct foreign-exchange business. 

In
addition, conversion of Renminbi for capital account items, including direct investment and loans, is subject to governmental approval
in the PRC, and companies are required to open and maintain separate foreign-exchange accounts for capital account items. There is no
guarantee that PRC regulatory authorities will not impose additional restrictions on the convertibility of the Renminbi. Such restrictions
could prevent us from distributing dividends and thereby reduce the value of our stock. 

The
fluctuation of the exchange rate of the Renminbi against the dollar could reduce the value of your investment. 

The
value of our common stock will be affected by the foreign exchange rate between U.S. dollars and Renminbi. For example, to the extent
that we need to convert U.S. dollars we receive from an offering of our securities into Renminbi for our operations, appreciation of
the Renminbi against the U.S. Dollar could reduce the value in Renminbi of our funds. Conversely, if we decide to convert our Renminbi
into U.S. dollars for the purpose of declaring dividends on our common stock or for other business purposes and the U.S. dollar appreciates
against the Renminbi, the U.S. dollar equivalent of our earnings from our subsidiaries in China would be reduced. 

83 

On
July 21, 2005, the PRC government changed its decade-old policy of pegging the value of the Renminbi to the U.S. Dollar. Under the 2005
policy, the Renminbi is permitted to fluctuate within a narrow and managed band against a basket of certain foreign currencies. Renminbi
appreciated by more than 20 against the U.S. dollar between July 2005 and July 2008. Between July 2008 and June 2010, this appreciation
halted and the exchange rate between the Renminbi and the U.S. dollar remained within a narrow band. Between July 2008 and June 2010,
this appreciation halted and the exchange rate between the Renminbi and the U.S. dollar remained within a narrow band. On June 19, 2010,
the People s Bank of China decided to further promote the reform of the Renminbi exchange rate formation mechanism, and improve
the flexibility of Renminbi exchange rate. The Company and its subsidiaries (both domestic and overseas) have debts denominated in foreign
currencies, fluctuations in the exchange rates of Renminbi and Singapore dollar into foreign currencies creates exchange risk for the
Company. With the internationalization process and RMB joining the SDR, RMB exchange rate may continue to fluctuate in the future. In
August 2015, the People s Bank of China perfected its midpoint rate determination mechanism, which led to a 2 depreciation of
Renminbi against the U.S. dollar. However, it is difficult to predict how market forces or PRC or U.S. government policy may impact the
exchange rate between the Renminbi and the U.S. dollar in the future. There remains significant international pressure on the PRC Government
to further liberalize its currency policy, which could result in further fluctuations in the value of the Renminbi against the U.S. dollar.
However, there is no assurance that there will not be a devaluation of Renminbi in the future. If there is such devaluation, our debt
servicing cost will increase and the return to our overseas investors may decrease. 

The
PRC government imposes controls on the convertibility of Renminbi into foreign currencies and, in certain cases, the remittance of currency
out of the China. Shortages in the availability of foreign currency may restrict our ability to remit sufficient foreign currency to
pay dividends, or otherwise satisfy foreign currency denominated obligations. Under existing PRC foreign exchange regulations, payments
of current account items, including profit distributions, interest payments and expenditures from the transaction, can be made in foreign
currencies without prior approval from SAFE by complying with certain procedural requirements. However, approval from appropriate governmental
authorities is required where Renminbi are to be converted into foreign currency and remitted out of the PRC to pay capital expenses,
such as the repayment of bank loans denominated in foreign currencies. 

The
PRC government could also restrict access in the future to foreign currencies for current account transactions. If the foreign exchange
control system prevents us from obtaining sufficient foreign currency to satisfy our currency demands, we may not be able to pay certain
expenses as they become due. 

84 

Recent
international trade tensions could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 

Economic
conditions in China are sensitive to global economic conditions. The global financial markets have experienced significant disruptions
in the past, including the recent international trade disputes and tariff actions announced by the United States, the PRC and certain
other countries. The U.S. administration has imposed significant amount of tariffs on Chinese goods, and the PRC government has imposed
tariffs on certain goods manufactured in the United States. There is no assurance that the list of goods impacted by additional tariffs
will not be expanded or the tariffs will not be increased materially. It is difficult to predict how PRC or U.S. government policy, in
particular, the outbreak of a trade war between the PRC and the United States and the imposition in 2018 of additional tariffs on bilateral
imports, may continue to impact the PRC. If the list of goods is further expanded or the tariff is further increased, the volume of China-U.S.
import and export trade would drop significantly, which will lead to deterioration in economic conditions of both countries and decrease
of business and official activities between both countries. If any new tariffs, legislation and/or regulations are implemented, or if
existing trade agreements are renegotiated or, in particular, if the U.S. government takes retaliatory trade actions due to the recent
U.S.-China trade tension, such changes could negatively affect the demand for our products, which may in turn have an adverse effect
our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

We
face risks related to health epidemics, natural disasters and other calamities . 

Our
business could be adversely affected by the effects of health epidemics and natural disasters. In recent years, there have been breakouts
of epidemics in China and globally. Our business operations could be disrupted if any of our employees is suspected of having the novel
coronavirus, H1N1 flu, avian flu or another epidemic, which would require our employees to be quarantined and/or the facilities used
for our operations to be disinfected, and may cause the suspension of manufacturing of our products. In addition, our results of operations
could be adversely affected to the extent that such outbreak harms the Chinese economy in general and the automotive industry in particular.
The recent outbreak of coronavirus (COVID-19) has endangered the health of many people residing in China and significantly disrupted
travel and business activities, and economic conditions in China. These events could also significantly impact our industry and cause
a temporary shutdown of the facilities we use for our operations, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition and results of operations. 

We
are also vulnerable to natural disasters and other calamities. We cannot assure you that our infrastructure will be adequate to protect
us from the effects of fire, floods, typhoons, earthquakes, power loss, telecommunications failures, break-ins, war, riots, terrorist
attacks or similar events. Any of the foregoing events may disrupt our research and development and manufacturer processes, disrupt our
business operations, and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Physical
Plant and Production 

Our
executive offices are located in Chaoyang District, Beijing, the capital city of China. Our owned facility includes two-floor office
space (2,331.90 square meters) and 5-parking-lot spaces (288.17 square meters). The Company obtained the title of such offices and parking
lots on April 28, 2017. 

We
had production facilities located in the Harbin Development Zone in the City of Harbin, which is the provincial capital of Heilongjiang
Province in northeast China. Our owned facility has a total usable area of 7,359 square meters (79,212 square feet). The facility includes
six buildings with one office building attached by one workshop, one storage room, one transformer station, and two guard rooms. All
the Company s properties are insured by China Pacific Property Insurances Co., Ltd. 

The
land on which our owned facility in Heilongjiang is located measures 14,715 square meters (158,391 square feet). The land use right was
issued to HLJ Xinda Group by the City of Harbin and will expire in 2053. In October 2017, HLJ Xinda Group gained additional 95,758 square
meters (1,030,734 square feet) land use right by the City of Harbin and will expire in 2067. We also have a long-term lease of the production
facilities with Xinda High-Tech. The land on which our leased facility is located measures 16,537 square meters (178,009 square feet).
The facility we rent includes three buildings with two office buildings attached by one workshop respectively and one guard room. 

The
two lands on which our owned facility in Sichuan are located measures 287,503 square meters (3,094,657 square feet) and 23,859 square
meters (256,816 square feet), respectively. The land use rights were issued to Sichuan Xinda by the City of Nanchong and will expire
in 2065 and 2085, respectively. 

The
land on which our owned facility in Dubai is located measures 52,530 square meters (565,428 square feet) issued to Dubai Xinda by Department
of Planning Development, Ports, Customs Free Zone, Government of Dubai. 

On
May 9, 2011, Harbin Xinda, a subsidiary of China XD, entered into a purchase agreement with Harbin Shengtong Engineering Plastics Co.
Ltd. Harbin Shengtong as amended on June 1, 2011. The legal representative of Harbin Shengtong is a former employee of
Harbin Xinda. Pursuant to the purchase agreement, Harbin Xinda will purchase from Harbin Shengtong land use rights and a plant consisting
of five workshops, a building and certain ancillary facilities (the Project ). Harbin Shengtong is responsible to complete
the construction of the plant and workshops according to Harbin Xinda s specifications. Once the Project is fully completed and
accepted by Harbin Xinda, Harbin Shengtong shall transfer titles of the Project to Harbin Xinda. During the year ended December 31, 2014,
the Project was completed. The total cost for the Project was RMB501.5 million. The titles of the five workshops are expected to transfer
to the Company by the end of the third quarter of 2021. 

Since
2013, the HLJ Xinda Group had approximately 390,000 metric tons of annual production capacity across 88 automatic production lines utilizing
German twin-screw extruding systems, automatic weighing systems and Taiwan conveyer systems. In July 2017, the HLJ Xinda Group launched
a new industrial project for upgrading existing equipment for 100,000 metric tons of engineering plastics, which we expect to be completed
by the end of the second quarter of 2020. The reason for such delay is due to additional time for equipment s installation and
test. In 2019, HLJ Xinda Group started another two equipment projects totaling 155,000 MT in Qinling Road Factory Qinling Road
Project and Jiangnan Road Factory Jiangnan Road Project for equipment upgrade and overhaul progress, which is
expected be completed by the end of the third quarter of 2020 Also included is an industrial project for 300,000 metric tons of biological
composite materials, an industrial project for a 3D printing intelligent manufacture demonstration factory and a 3D printing display
and experience cloud factory, all of which we expect to be completed by the end of 2023. 

86 

In
 December 2013, we broke ground on the construction site of our fourth production plant in Nanchong
City, Sichuan Province, with additional 300,000 metric tons of annual production capacity, expecting to bring total domestic installed
production capacity to 690,000 metric tons with the addition of 70 new production lines upon the completion of the construction of our
fourth production plant. Sichuan Xinda has been supplying to its customers since 2013, mainly backed by production capacity in our Harbin
production plant in its inception. We installed 50 production lines in the second half of 2016 in our Sichuan plant with production capacity
of 216,000 metric tons during the year of 2017 and an additional 10 production lines in July 2018, bringing the total capacity to 259,200
metric tons. As of December 31, 2020, there is still construction ongoing on the site of our Sichuan plant which is expected to
be completed by the end of the third quarter of 2022. The reason for such delay is due to additional time for equipment s
installation and test and building decoration. 

In
order to develop potential overseas markets, Dubai Xinda obtained one leased property and two purchased properties, approximately 52,530
square meters in total, including one leased property of 10,000 square meters, and two purchased two properties of 20,206 and 22,324
square meters on January 25, 2015, June 28, 2016 and September 21, 2016, respectively, from Jebel Ali Free Zone Authority JAFZA in Dubai, UAE, with constructed building comprising warehouses, offices and service blocks. In addition to the earlier 10 trial production
lines in Dubai Xinda, we completed installing 45 production lines with 11,250 metric tons of annual production capacity by the end of
November 2018. As of December 31, 2012, an additional 30 production lines with 7,500 metric tons of annual production capacity
mainly targeted for ABS products, were still in the progress of redesigning upgrading and further equipment testing. The Company estimates
22 production lines will be put into production in the second quarter of 2022, 8 production lines will be put into production in the
second quarter of 2022, and will then increase the total production capacity in Dubai Xinda to 21,250 metric tons, targeting high-end
products for the overseas market. 

The
process of manufacturing modified plastic consists of modifying a standard plastic (polypropylene, ABS, PA6, PA66, etc.) by adding various
agents and additives that will alter the physical and/or functional characteristics of the plastic. Catalysts are added that facilitate
the desired chemical reactions, all of which occurs in a specially designed equipment. The resulting plastics are then extracted from
the equipment by an extraction technique that is proprietary to HLJ Xinda Group. Further processing may involve additional blending,
extrusion, cooling and cutting, homogenizing and packing, as needed to meet the customer s requirements. 

In
addition to its unique extraction technology, HLJ Xinda Group has developed its own techniques and equipment for many of the steps in
the production process. Among the aspects of production for which HLJ Xinda Group has proprietary technology are product formulae, a
technique for combining extruder screws, and certain stuffing techniques . With these unique formulas and techniques, our products
can satisfy clients standard requirements at a lower cost than competitive products. 

Our
facilities have been certified under the following international qualifications criteria: ISO9001: 2000 quality management system certification
and ISO/TS16949: 2002 international auto parts industry quality systems certification. The Chinese government has designated HLJ Xinda
Group as a National Torch Project and a National Spark Plan Project, and has given HLJ Xinda Group the Most Valuable High Tech
in China award. HLJ Xinda Group is an executive member of the Council of the Chinese Automobile Parts Association, a member of
the Chinese Modified Plastics Professional Committee, a member of the Chinese Plastics Engineering Committee and Heilongjiang Province

ITEM
7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

The
following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the section
titled Selected Consolidated Financial and Other Data and the consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto
included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.
Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include those identified below and those discussed in the section titled Risk
Factors and other parts of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our historical results are not necessarily indicative of the results
that may be expected for any period in the future. 

General 

China
XD is one of the leading specialty chemical companies engaged in the research, development, manufacture and sale of modified plastics
primarily for automotive applications in China, and to a lesser extent, in Dubai, UAE. Through our wholly-owned operating subsidiaries
in China and UAE, we develop modified plastics using our proprietary technology, manufacture and sell our products primarily for use
in the fabrication of automobile parts and components. We have 688 certifications from manufacturers in the automobile industry as of
December 31, 2020. We are the only company certified as a National Enterprise Technology Center in modified plastics industry in Heilongjiang
province. Our Research and Development (the R D team consists of 127 professionals and 7
 consultants. As a result of the integration of our academic and technological expertise, we have
a portfolio of 647 patents, 63 of which we have obtained the patent rights and the remaining 584 of which we have applications pending
in China as of December 31, 2020. 

Our
products include twelve categories: Modified Polypropylene (PP), Modified Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene (ABS), Modified Polyamide 66
(PA66), Modified Polyamide 6 (PA6), Modified Polyoxymethylenes (POM), Modified Polyphenylene Oxide (PPO), Plastic Alloy, Modified Polyphenylene
Sulfide (PPS), Modified Polyimide (PI), Modified Polylactic acid (PLA), Poly Ether Ether Ketone (PEEK), and Polyethylene (PE). 

The
Company s products are primarily used in the production of exterior and interior trim and functional components of 29 automobile
brands and 111 automobile models manufactured in China, including Audi, Mercedes Benz, BMW, Toyota, Buick, Chevrolet, Mazda, Volvo, Ford,
Citroen, Jinbei, VW Passat, Golf, Jetta, etc. Our research center is dedicated to the research and development of modified plastics,
and benefits from its cooperation with well-known scientists from prestigious universities in China. We operate three manufacturing plants
in Harbin, Heilongjiang in the PRC. Prior to December 2012, we had approximately 255,000 metric tons of annual production capacity across
58 automatic production lines utilizing German twin-screw extruding systems, automatic weighing systems and Taiwan conveyer systems.
In December 2012, we further expanded our third production base in Harbin with additional 135,000 metric tons of annual production capacity,
bringing total installed production capacity in our three production bases to 390,000 metric tons with additional 30 new production lines.
In July 2017, our Harbin campus launched a new industrial project for upgrading existing equipment for 100,000 metric tons of engineering
plastics. As a result, our production capacity in Harbin, Heilongjiang was downgraded to 290,000 MT. In 2019, our Harbin campus started
two equipment projects in Qinling Road Factory Qinling Road Project and Jiangnan Road Factory Jiangnan Road Project for equipment upgrade and overhaul progress, which further downgraded our production capacity to 135,000 MT. The industrial project for
upgrading existing equipment for 100,000 metric tons of engineering plastics was expected to be completed by the end of 2020, Qinling
Road Project and Jiangnan Road Project was expected to be completed by the end of 2020, thus bringing the production capacity in Harbin
Campus back to 390,000 MT. Also, in July 2017, HLJ Xinda Group started an industrial project for 300,000 metric tons of biological composite
materials, an industrial project for a 3D printing intelligent manufacture demonstration factory and a 3D printing display and experience
cloud factory. This project with four workshops was formally broken ground in December 2019. The Company expects the gradual trial out
by the end of 2022 and put into production by the end of 2023. 

91 

In
December 2013, we broke ground on the construction of our fourth production plant in Nanchong City, Sichuan Province, with additional
300,000 metric tons of annual production capacity, which we expect will bring total domestic installed production capacity to 590,000
metric tons with the addition of 70 new production lines upon the completion of the construction of our fourth production plant. Sichuan
Xinda has been supplying to its customers since 2013. We installed 50 production lines in the second half of 2016 in our Sichuan plant
with production capacity of 216,000 metric tons during the year of 2017 and an additional 10 production lines in July 2018, bringing
the total capacity to 259,200 metric tons. As of December 31, 2020, there is still construction ongoing on the site of our Sichuan plant
which is expected to be completed by the end of the third quarter of 2022 . 

In
order to develop potential overseas markets, Dubai Xinda obtained one leased property and two purchased properties, approximately 52,530
square meters in total, including one leased 10,000 square meters, and two purchased 20,206 and 22,324 square meters on January 25, 2015,
June 28, 2016 and September 21, 2016, respectively, from Jebel Ali Free Zone Authority JAFZA in Dubai, UAE, with constructed
building comprising warehouses, offices and service blocks. In addition to the earlier 10 trial production lines in Dubai Xinda, the
Company completed installing 45 production lines with 11,250 metric tons of annual production capacity by the end of November 2018, and
an additional 30 production lines with 7,500 metric tons of annual production capacity. The Company previously estimated 22 production
lines to be put into production in the fourth quarter of 2021, and 8 production lines in the second quarter of 2022. Due to the negative
impact of COVID-19, this project was suspended and the Company plans to resume the installation process by the first half of 2022 .
The new completion timeline is estimated by the end of 2022, thus bringing total installed production capacity in Dubai Xinda to 21,250
metric tons, targeting high-end products for the overseas market. 

Due
to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company s manufacturing facilities in Harbin and Sichuan was temporarily shut down from early February
2020 to early March 2020 while our Dubai facilities was suspended operation from early February 2020 till current in accordance with
the requirement of the local governments. The Company s business was negatively impacted and generated lower revenue and net income
during the period from February to April 2020. The extent of the impact of COVID-19 on the Company s results of operations and
financial condition will depend on the virus future developments, including the duration and spread of the outbreak and the impact
on the Company s customers, which are still uncertain and cannot be reasonably estimated at this point of time. 

Critical
Accounting Policies 

We
prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which requires us to make judgments, estimates and assumptions
that affect (1) the reported amounts of our assets and liabilities; (2) the disclosure of our contingent assets and liabilities at the
end of each reporting period; and (3) the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during each reporting period. We continually evaluate
these judgments, estimates and assumptions based on our own historical experience, knowledge and assessment of current business and other
conditions and our expectations regarding the future based on available information which together form our basis for making judgments
about matters that are not readily apparent from other sources. Since the use of estimates is an integral component of the financial
reporting process, our actual results could differ from those estimates. Some of our accounting policies require a higher degree of judgment
than others in their application. 

92 

When
reading our consolidated financial statements, you should consider our selection of critical accounting policies, the judgment and other
uncertainties affecting the application of such policies, and the sensitivity of reported results to changes in conditions and assumptions.
We believe the following accounting policies involve the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated
financial statements. 

Long-Lived
Assets 

Our
long-lived assets include property, plant and equipment and land use rights. 

We
depreciate and amortize our property, plant and equipment and land use rights, using the straight-line method of accounting over the
estimated useful lives of the assets. We make estimates of the useful lives of property, plant and equipment, including the salvage values,
and land use rights in order to determine the amount of depreciation and amortization expense to be recorded during each reporting period.
The estimated useful life is the period over which the long-lived assets are expected to contribute directly or indirectly to the future
cash flows of the Company. 

We
evaluate long-lived assets, including property, plant and equipment, and land use rights for impairment whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. We assess recoverability by comparing carrying
amount of a long-lived asset or asset group to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or asset
group. If the carrying amount of an asset or asset group exceeds its estimated undiscounted future cash flows, we recognize an impairment
charge based on the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset or asset group. We estimate the
fair value of the asset or asset group through various valuation techniques, including discounted cash flow models, quoted market values
and third-party independent appraisals, as considered necessary. Assets to be disposed are reported at the lower of carrying amount or
fair value less costs to sell, and are no longer depreciated. 

Impairment
charges of US 165.3 million was recognized for long-lived assets during the year ended December 31, 2020 (See Note 26
to Consolidated Financial Statements). 

Allowance
for Doubtful Accounts 

We
maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments.
In establishing the required allowance, we consider historical losses adjusted to take into account current market conditions, the amount
of receivables in dispute, and the current receivables aging and current payment patterns. Account balances are charged off against the
allowance after all means of collection have been exhausted and the potential for recovery is considered remote. We do not have any off-balance-sheet
credit exposure related to our customers. 

93 

We
extend unsecured credit to customers with good credit history. We review our accounts receivable on a regular basis to determine if the
bad debt allowance is adequate at each year-end. 

Valuation
of Inventories 

Our
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value (NRV). We routinely evaluate quantities and value of our inventories
in light of current market conditions and market trends, and record a write-down against the cost of inventories for net realizable value
below cost. Expected demand and anticipated sales price are the key factors affecting our inventory valuation analysis. For purposes
of our inventory valuation analysis, we develop expected demand and anticipated sales prices primarily based on sales orders as well
as industry trends and individual customer analysis. We also consider sales and sales orders after each reporting period-end but before
the issuance of our financial statements to assess the accuracy of our inventory valuation estimates. Historically, actual demand and
sales price have generally been consistent with or greater than expected demand and anticipated sales price used for purposes of our
inventory valuation analysis. The evaluation also takes into consideration new product development schedules, the effect that new products
might have on the sale of existing products, product obsolescence, customer concentrations, product merchantability and other factors.
Market conditions are subject to change and actual consumption of inventories could differ from forecasted demand. Our products have
a long life cycle and obsolescence has not historically been a significant factor in the valuation of inventories. We have not experienced
any material inventory write-downs before. 

Income
Tax Uncertainties and Realization of Deferred Income Tax Assets 

Our
income tax provision, deferred income tax assets and deferred income tax liabilities are recognized and measured primarily based on actual
and expected future income, PRC statutory income tax rates, PRC tax regulations and tax planning strategies. 

Significant
judgment is required in interpreting tax regulations in the PRC, evaluating uncertain tax positions, and assessing the realizability
of deferred income tax assets. Actual results could differ materially from those judgments, and changes in judgments could materially
affect our consolidated financial statements. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had total gross deferred income tax assets of US 33,524,819
and US 14,313,575, respectively. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred income tax assets if, based on the weight of
available evidence, we believe expected future taxable income is not likely to support the use of a deduction or credit in that jurisdiction.
We evaluate the level of our valuation allowances quarterly, and more frequently if actual operating results differ significantly from
forecasted results. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, our valuation allowance against deferred income tax assets was US 33,524,819 and
US 14,313,575, respectively. 

We
recognize the impact of a tax position if we determine the position is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination, including
resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based solely on the technical merits of the position. In evaluating whether
a tax position has met the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, it is presumed that the position will be examined by the appropriate
tax authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. In addition, a tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition
threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. The tax position is measured at the
largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent (50 likely of being realized upon settlement. The tax positions are regularly
re-evaluated based on the results of the examination of income tax filings, statute of limitations expirations and changes in tax law
that would either increase or decrease the technical merits of a position relative to the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold.
In the normal course of business, we are regularly audited by the PRC tax authorities. The settlement of any particular issue with the
applicable tax authority could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 

94 

Stock
Based Compensation 

We
measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the
award and recognize the cost over the period the employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award, which generally is
the vesting period. We have elected to recognize the compensation cost for an award with only service conditions and a graded vesting
schedule on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award. However, the cumulative amount of compensation
cost recognized at any date equals at least the portion of the grant date value of such award that is vested at that date. 

We
estimated the fair value of our share options using the Black-Scholes Option Pricing model. The model incorporates subjective assumptions.
The expected volatility was based on implied volatilities from traded options and historical volatility of the Company s common
stock. The risk-free interest rate assumption is determined using the Federal Reserve nominal rates for U.S. Treasury zero-coupon bonds
with maturities similar to those of the expected term of the award being valued. There is no expected dividend yield, as the Company
has not paid dividend and does not anticipate paying dividend over the term of the grants. 

Recent
Development 

On
November 5, 2020, the Company held a special meeting of stockholders, at which the Company s stockholders voted, among other things,
in favor of the proposal to adopt the previously announced agreement and plan of merger (the Merger Agreement ), dated as
of June 15, 2020, by and among the Company, Faith Dawn Limited, an exempted company with limited liability incorporated under the laws
of the Cayman Islands Parent ), and Faith Horizon Inc., a Nevada corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of Parent Merger
Sub ), providing for the merger of the Merger Sub with and into the Company, with the Company continuing as the surviving corporation
and as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent (the Merger ). 

On
December 13, 2020, the Company entered into an amendment No.1 (the Amendment to that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger
dated June 15, 2020 (as so amended, the Merger Agreement by and among the Company, Faith Dawn Limited Parent ),
and Faith Horizon Inc. Merger Sub ), a Nevada corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent. The Amendment extends
the Termination Date (as defined in the Merger Agreement) to February 7, 2021. The special committee of the board of directors of the
Company and the board of directors of the Company both approved the Amendment to permit additional time for the parties to the Merger
Agreement to complete the merger. The parties to the Merger Agreement are currently working on the logistics to complete the Merger.
Other than as described herein, the Amendment does not amend any other provision of the Merger Agreement. 

On
February 7, 2021, the Company entered into an amendment No.2 (the Second Amendment to that certain Agreement and Plan
of Merger dated June 15, 2020, as amended on December 13, 2020 (as so amended, the Merger Agreement by and among the Company,
Faith Dawn Limited Parent ), and Faith Horizon Inc. Merger Sub ), a Nevada corporation and a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Parent. The Second Amendment extends the Termination Date (as defined in the Merger Agreement) to May 10, 2021.The special
committee of the board of directors of the Company and the board of directors of the Company both approved the Second Amendment to permit
additional time for the parties to the Merger Agreement to complete the merger. The parties to the Merger Agreement are currently working
on the logistics to complete the Merger. Other than as described herein, the Second Amendment does not amend any other provision of the
Merger Agreement. 

95 

On
May 8, 2021, the Company issued a notice of termination to Parent (the Notice of Termination notifying Parent that the
Company terminated the merger agreement pursuant to Section 9.1(c)(i) of the merger agreement, based on Parent and Merger Sub s
breaches of the merger agreement, which have given rise to the failure of several conditions set forth in Section 8.1 and Section 8.3
of the merger agreement. These breaches are not capable of being cured prior to the termination date of the merger agreement. Pursuant
to the Notice of Termination, as a result of such termination, the Parent Termination Fee becomes due and payable to the Company by Parent.
On May 12, 2021, Parent sent a response letter, dated May 11, 2021 (the Response Letter ), to the Company that while it
disagrees with the allegations made in the Notice of Termination, Parent acknowledges that the Company may terminate the merger agreement
pursuant to Section 9.1(c)(iii) of the merger agreement and thus agrees to pay the Parent Termination Fee pursuant to Section 9.3(b)
of the merger agreement under that basis. As a result of the termination of the merger agreement, the merger will not be completed.

Revenues 

Revenues
decreased by 9.4 , or US 136.3 million, in 2020 as compared to 2019 .
This was due to a decrease of 7.8 in sales volume, and a decrease of 1.6 in the average 
 RMB selling price of our products, as compared with those of the same period of last year. 

(1)
Domestic market 

For
the year ended December 31, 2020, revenue from domestic market decreased by 5.5 or US 75.6 million, as a result of a
decrease of 6.4 in sales volume, and partially offset by an increase of 1.0 in the average RMB selling price of our products, as compared
with those of the same period of last year. 

96 

According
to the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers, automobile production and sales in China decreased by 2.0 and 1.9 , respectively,
for twelve months of 2020 as compared to the same period of 2019. The weakening in macroeconomic conditions since the outbreak of COVID-19
pandemic in January 2020 continued to exacerbate auto business environment throughout year of 2020. The Company s business was
negatively impacted and has generated lower revenue during the period from February to April 2020. Thanks to our positive efforts to
expand our customer bases and to meet their new requirements, including producing
raw materials for PPE such as goggles and masks, to help alleviate the pandemic to our communities and mitigate the negative impact of
world pandemic on Chinese auto industry , the Company has begun to recover slowly after May 2020. We achieved sales increase by
75.7 in Southwest China, 35.3 in East China and 7.5 in South China, although our sales decreased by 62.1 in Northeast China, 21.9 
in Central China and 15.2 in North China, for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to
the same period of 2019. 

As
for the RMB selling price, the increase of 1.0 was mainly due to increased sales of new categories of higher-end products of PA66 and
PA6 produced with high-priced raw materials with higher selling price in domestic markets during the year ended December 31, 2020. 

(2)
Overseas market 

Overseas
sales were nil for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to US 61.2 million in prior year. 

The
Dubai facility was temporarily shut down since late February and has not resumed its operation till the current period, which has negatively
impacted operations in Dubai facility. 

We
have experienced a delay in cash collection from a major customer in UAE. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we provided an allowance
of US 64.8million and US 62.8 million, respectively, for the overdue accounts receivable from the major customer in UAE, as the
customer failed to make payments under the agreed extended repayment plan.

The
Company continued to shift production mix from traditional lower-end products such as PP to higher-end products such as PA66, PA6, and
PE, primarily due to (i) greater growth potential of advanced modified plastics in luxury automobile models in China, (ii) the stronger
demand as a result of promotion by the Chinese government for clean energy vehicles and (iii) better quality demand from and consumer
recognition of higher-end cars made by automotive manufacturers from Chinese and Germany joint ventures, Sino-U.S. and Sino-Japanese
joint ventures, which manufacturers tend to use more and higher-end modified plastics in quantity per vehicle in China.

in 2019, primarily due to the increased cost for idle capacity as a result of shutdown.

Research
and development expenses were US 22.5 million in 2020 compared with US 50.3 million in 2019, representing a decrease of US 27.8 million,
or 55.3 . This decrease was due to (i) a decrease of US 14.9 million in raw materials consumption, (ii) a decrease of US 0.4 million
in depreciation, and (iii) a decrease of US 0.2 million in salary and welfare for R D personnel. 

As
of December 31, 2020, the number of ongoing research and development projects was 347 .
 We expect to complete and commence to realize economic benefits from
approximately 25 of the projects in the near term. The majority of the projects are in the field of modified plastics in automotive

The
decrease of effective income tax rate in 2020 was primarily due to the increased loss before income taxes from Dubai Xinda, and
decreased income before taxes from HLJ Xinda Group and Sichuan Xinda. 

Our
PRC and Dubai subsidiaries had US 183.4 million of cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash as of
December 31, 2020, which are planned to be indefinitely reinvested in PRC. The distributions from our PRC subsidiaries
are subject to the U.S. federal income tax at 21 , less any applicable foreign tax credits. Due to our policy of indefinitely reinvesting
our earnings in our PRC business, we have not provided for deferred income tax liabilities related to PRC withholding income tax on undistributed
earnings of our PRC subsidiaries.

Stockholders equity as of December 31,

million for Dubai Xinda, offset by the increase of US 50.0 million noncontrolling interests and the decrease of US 37.9
million accumulated other comprehensive loss. Cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash decreased by 19.7 or US 45.1
million primarily due to the increase of US 45.1 million operating activity cash outflows. The aggregate short-term and
long-term bank loans increased by 53.4 due to using the line of credits to support operating and investing activities in HLJ
Xinda Group and Sichuan Xinda. We define the manageable debt level as the sum of aggregate short-term and long-term loans over total
assets. 

102 

LIQUIDITY
AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 

Historically, our primary uses of cash have been
to finance working capital needs and capital expenditures for new production lines. We have financed these requirements primarily from
cash generated from operations, bank borrowings and the issuance of our convertible preferred stocks and debt financings. As of December
31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, we had US 183.3 million and US 228.4 million, respectively, in the total amount of cash and cash equivalents
and restricted cash, which were primarily deposited with banks in China (including Hong Kong and Macau SAR), UAE and U.S. As of
December 31, 2020, we had US 643.6 million outstanding short-term bank loans (including the current portion of long-term bank
loans), including US 481.0 million unsecured loan, US 36.5 million guaranteed loan, US 15.3 million loans secured by restricted
cash, US 12.3 million loans secured by inventories, and US 98.5 million long-term bank loans that due in one year. We also had
US 727.3 million long-term loans (excluding the current portion), including US 585.9 million loans secured by an undated security
cheque, and US 239.9 million unsecured loans. Short-term and long-term bank loans in total bear a weighted average interest rate
of 5.6 per annum and do not contain any renewal terms. We have historically been able to make repayments when due. 

However,
as disclosed in Note 3 in the Company s financial statements, for the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company had a significant loss
of US 181.7 million primarily due to an impairment of long-lived assets of US 165.3 million for Dubai Xinda and had recurring operating
cash outflows of US 3.0 million. These conditions raised substantial doubts about the Company s ability to continue as a going
concern.

bank loan in the amount of US 727.3 million (including principals and interests). 

103 

We
expect that we will be able to meet our needs to fund operations, capital expenditures and other commitments in the next 12 months primarily
with our cash and cash equivalents, operating cash flows and bank borrowings and contribution from the principal shareholder.

We
may, however, require additional cash resources due to changes in business conditions or other future developments. If these sources
are insufficient to satisfy our cash requirements, we may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain a credit facility.
The sale of additional equity or equity-linked securities could result in additional dilution to stockholders. The incurrence of indebtedness
would result in increased debt service obligations and could result in operating and financial covenants that would restrict operations.
Financing may not be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, or at all. 

The
following table sets forth a summary of our cash flows for years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.

Net cash used in operating activities was US 3.0
million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to US 189.9 million used in operating activities for the year ended December
31, 2019, primarily due to (i) the decrease of approximately US 255.5 million in cash collected from our customers,
(ii) the increase of US 6.5 million interest payments, partially offset by (vi) the decrease of approximately US 335.1 million in cash
operating payments, including raw material purchases, rental and personnel costs, (v) the increase of US 9.1 million received
from government grant, and (vi) the decrease of US 4.8 million in income tax payments, and (vii) the decrease of US 5.5
million interest payment.

Investing
Activities 

Net cash used in the investing activities
was US 431.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to US 130.1 million for the same period of last year, mainly due to
(i) the increase of US 51.3 million purchase of property, plant and equipment, (ii) the increase of US 231.2 million of loans to third
parties, (iii) the decrease of US 7.3 million proceeds from sales of a subsidiary, (iv) the decrease of 15.7 million refund of prepayment
for property and equipment purchase, and partially offset by (v) the increase of US 3.8 million Government grant related to the project
construction and (vi) the increase of US 0.7 million proceeds from disposal of property, plant and equipment. 

Financing
Activities 

Net cash provided by financing activities
was US 387.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to US 185.9 million for the same period of last year, primarily
as a result of the decrease of (i) the proceeds of US 1,033.8 million from bank borrowings, (ii) the increase of US 47.2 million capital
injection from noncontrolling interests, (iii) the decrease of US 64.7 million repayment of interest-free advances from related parties,
(iv) the decrease of US 4.4 million payments of issuance cost of bank borrowings, (v) the decrease of US 0.1 million payments of issuance
costs for syndicated loans, partially offset by (vi) the decrease of US 1,038.6 million proceeds from bank borrowings, (vii) the decrease
of US 77.2 million proceeds of interest-free advances from related parties and (viii) the increase of US 0.1 million payments of issuance
costs for syndicated loans. 

As
of December 31, 2020, our cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash balance was US 183.3 million, compared to US 228.4 million
at December 31, 2019. 

Days
Sales Outstanding DSO has increased from 72 days for the year ended December 31, 2019 to 89 days for the year
ended December 31, 2020 as a result of cash collection of overdue accounts receivable from customers in 2020. 

It
takes shorter to collect from our customers. We believe that our DSO is still below industry average. Industry Standard Customer and
Supplier Payment Terms (days) as below: 

Year ended December 31, 2020

Inventory turnover days increased
from 185 days for the year ended December 31, 2019 to 188 days for the year
ended December 31, 2020. 

Turnover
days of payables have decreased from 21 days for the year ended December 31, 2019 to 20 days for the year ended December 31, 2020. 

Based
on past performance and current expectations, we believe that our current cash and cash equivalents and anticipated cash flows from operating
activities will satisfy our working capital needs, capital expenditures and other liquidity requirements associated with our operations
for at least the next 12 months. 

The
majority of the Company s revenues and expenses were denominated primarily in Renminbi RMB ), the currency of the
People s Republic of China. There is no assurance that exchange rates between the RMB and the U.S. Dollar will remain stable. Inflation
has not had a material impact on the Company s business.

ITEM
7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 

Interest
Rate Risk 

We
are exposed to interest rate risk primarily with respect to our short-term and long-term bank loans. Although the interest rates of our
short-term and long-term bank loans, which are based on the prime rates set by People s Bank of China, are fixed during the terms
of the loans, increase in interest rates will increase the cost of new borrowings and our interest expense. 

A
hypothetical 1.0 increase in the annual interest rate for all of our credit facilities under which we had outstanding borrowings as
of December 31, 2020 would decrease income before income taxes by approximately US 17.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.
Management monitors the banks prime rates in conjunction with our cash requirements to determine the appropriate level of debt
balances relative to other sources of funds. We have not entered into any hedging transactions in an effort to reduce our exposure to
interest rate risk. 

Foreign
Currency Exchange Rates 

Majority
of our revenues are collected in and our expenses are paid in RMB. We face foreign currency rate translation risks when our results are
translated to U.S. dollars. 

The
RMB was relatively stable against the U.S. dollar at approximately 8.28 RMB to the US 1.00 until July 21, 2005 when the Chinese currency
regime was altered resulting in a 2.1 revaluation versus the U.S. dollar. From July 21, 2005 to June 30, 2010, the RMB exchange rate
was no longer linked to the U.S. dollar but rather to a basket of currencies with a 0.3 margin of fluctuation resulting in further appreciation
of the RMB against the U.S. dollar. Since June 30, 2009, the exchange rate had remained stable at 6.8307 RMB to 1.00 U.S. dollar until
June 30, 2010 when the People s Bank of China allowed a further appreciation of the RMB by 0.43 to 6.798 RMB to 1.00 U.S. dollar.
The People s Bank of China allowed the RMB and U.S. dollar exchange rate to fluctuate within 1 on April 16, 2012 and 2 on March
17, 2014 respectively. On December 31, 2020, the RMB traded at 6.5249 RMB to 1.00 U.S. dollar. 

There
remains international pressure on the Chinese government to adopt an even more flexible currency policy and the exchange rate of RMB
is subject to changes in China s government policies which are, to a large extent, dependent on the economic and political development
both internationally and locally and the demand and supply of RMB in the domestic market. There can be no assurance that such exchange
rate will continue to remain stable in the future amongst the volatility of currencies, globalization and the unstable economies in recent
years. Since (i) our revenues and net income of our PRC operating entities are denominated in RMB, and (ii) the payment of dividends,
if any, will be in U.S. dollars, any decrease in the value of RMB against U.S. dollars would adversely affect the value of the shares
and dividends payable to shareholders, in U.S. dollars.

ITEM
9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Under
the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we evaluated
the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and
15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act). Disclosure controls and procedures are controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information
required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported,
within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures
include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed
under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including our principal executive officer and our principal financial
officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on our assessment, the Chief Executive Officer
and the Chief Financial Officer determined that, as of December 31, 2020, and as of the date that the evaluation of the effectiveness
of our disclosure controls and procedures was completed, because of the material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting
described below, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective to satisfy the objectives for which they are intended. 

Notwithstanding
management s assessment that our internal control over financial reporting was ineffective as of December 31, 2020 due to the material
weakness described below under Management s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, we believe that the consolidated
financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K correctly present our financial condition, results of operations and
cash flows for the fiscal years covered thereby in all material respects. 

(a)
Management s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over the Company s financial reporting as
defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. The Company s internal control over financial reporting is a process
that is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements
for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and includes those policies and
procedures that: 

(1)
pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of
our assets; 

(2)
provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in
accordance with the authorization of our management and directors; and 

(3)
provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that
could have a material effect on the financial statements. 

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation
of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

Under
the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer,
we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on a framework established in
 Internal Control- Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO)
as of December 31, 2020. Based on such evaluation, our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer,
has concluded that the Company s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the
Exchange Act) as of December 31, 2020 was ineffective. This assessment identified one material weakness related to lack of sufficient
accounting and financial reporting personnel to formalize certain key controls over the financial reporting process and report financial
reporting information based on generally accepted accounting principles and SEC reporting requirements. 

Our
internal control over financial reporting is not subject to attestation by the Company s registered public accounting firm pursuant
to rules of the SEC that permit the Company to provide only management s report. 

110 

Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

During
the twelve months ended December 31, 20120 our efforts to improve our internal controls over financial reporting included (1) hiring
additional qualified financial staff; (2) adopting procedures to evaluate and assess performance of directors, officers and employees
of the Company, (3) internal meetings, discussions, trainings and seminars periodically to review and improve our internal control procedures.
We plan to improve on the above-referenced weakness by the end of the fiscal year ending December 31, 2020. 

Other
than the foregoing, there has been no other changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules
13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during our fourth fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2020 that has materially affected,
or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Family
Relationships 

There
are no family relationships between or among any of the executive officers or directors of the Company. 

Board
Leadership Structure 

The
Board of Directors believes that Jie Han s service as both Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer is in
the best interest of the Company and its stockholders. Mr. Han possesses detailed and in-depth knowledge of the issues, opportunities,
and challenges facing the Company, and is thus best positioned to develop agendas that ensure that the time and attention of our Board
of Directors are focused on the most critical matters. His combined role enables decisive leadership, ensures clear accountability, and
enhances the Company s ability to communicate its message and strategy clearly and consistently to the Company s stockholders,
employees and customers. 

Each
of the directors other than Jie Han and Taylor Zhang is independent (see Director Independence below), and the Board of
Directors believes that the independent directors provide effective oversight of management. The Board of Directors has not designated
a lead director. Our independent directors call and plan their executive sessions collaboratively and, between Board of Directors meetings,
communicate with management and one another directly. In the circumstances, the directors believe that formalizing in a lead director
functions in which they all participate might detract from rather than enhance performance of their responsibilities as directors. 

Director
Qualifications 

We
seek directors with established strong professional reputations and experience in areas relevant to the strategy and operations of our
businesses. We also seek directors who possess the qualities of integrity and candor, who have strong analytical skills and who are willing
to engage management and each other in a constructive and collaborative fashion, in addition to the ability and commitment to devote
significant time and energy to service on the Board of Directors and its committees. We believe that all of our directors meet the foregoing
qualifications. 

The
Nominating Committee and the Board of Directors believe that the leadership skills and other experiences of the members of its Board
of Directors, as described Item 10 DIRECTORS, EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE Directors and Executive
Officers , provide the Company with a range of perspectives and judgment necessary to guide our strategies and monitor their execution. 

Board
of Directors Practices 

Our
business and affairs are managed under the direction of our Board of Directors. The primary responsibilities of our Board of Directors
are to provide oversight, strategic guidance, counseling and direction to our management. It is our expectation that the Board of Directors
will meet regularly on a quarterly basis and additionally as required. 

114 

Board
of Directors Role in Risk Oversight 

The
Board of Directors as a whole has responsibility for risk oversight, with reviews of certain areas being conducted by the relevant Board
of Directors committees. These committees then provide reports to the full Board of Directors. The oversight responsibility of the Board
of Directors and its committees is enabled by management reporting processes that are designed to provide visibility to the Board of
Directors about the identification, assessment, and management of critical risks. These areas of focus include strategic, operational,
financial and reporting, succession and compensation, compliance, and other risks. The Board of Directors and its committees oversee
risks associated with their respective areas of responsibility, as summarized below. 

Meetings
of the Board of Directors 

The
Board of Directors held eight meetings during 2019. No director attended fewer than 75 of the meetings of the Board of Directors. No
director attended less than 75 of any meeting of a committee of which the director was a member in fiscal year 2019. 

Involvement
in Certain Legal Proceedings 

None
of our directors and officers has been involved in any of the legal proceedings specified in Item 401(f) of Regulation S-K in the past
10 years. 

Committees
of the Board of Directors 

Our
Board of Directors has an Audit Committee, a Nominating Committee, and a Compensation Committee. Our Board of Directors has determined
that Linyuan Zhai, Feng Li and Guanbao Huang, the members of these committees, are independent under the current independence
standards of NASDAQ Marketplace Rule 5605(a)(2) and meet the criteria for independence set forth in Rule 10A-3(b)(1) under the Exchange
Act. Our Board of Directors has also determined that these persons have no material relationships with us either directly or
as a partner, stockholder or officer of any entity which could be inconsistent with a finding of their independence as members
of our Board of Directors. 

115 

Audit
Committee 

The
Audit Committee was established on May 26, 2009. The Audit Committee operates under a written charter. The Audit Committee Charter can

was appointed as the Chairman of the Audit Committee. Currently, our Audit Committee consists of Feng Li, Linyuan Zhai and Guanbao Huang.
Each of the above-listed Audit Committee members were or are considered independent under the current independence standards
of NASDAQ Marketplace Rule 5605(a)(2) and meet the criteria for independence set forth in Rule 10A-3(b)(1) of the Exchange Act, as determined
by the Board of Directors. 

Our
Board of Directors has determined that we have at least one audit committee financial expert, as defined in the Exchange Act, serving
on our Audit Committee. Joseph Chow (resigned on March 6, 2019) and Xin Li (appointed on March 6, 2019 and resigned on January 1, 2020)
were the audit committee financial expert and were independent members of our Board of Directors during the year ended
December 31, 2019. Since January 2, 2020, Huiyi Chen has been determined by the Board as the audit committee financial expert 
and is an independent member of our Board of Directors.

AUDIT
COMMITTEE REPORT 

The
Audit Committee has reviewed and discussed our consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020, including
significant accounting policies applied by the Company in its consolidated financial statements, as well as alternative treatments with
management and the Company s independent registered public accounting firm. The Committee has discussed with the independent registered
public accounting firm all matters required by the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (the PCAOB ),
including those described in Auditing Standard No. 1301, Communications with Audit Committees . 

In
addition, the Committee has received the letter from the independent registered public accounting firm required by the applicable PCAOB
requirements concerning auditor independence, and the Committee has discussed with the independent registered public accounting firm
their independence from the Company and its management. The Committee has also considered whether the independent registered public accounting
firm s provision of non-audit services to the Company could affect the accountant s independence. The Committee has concluded
that the independent registered public accounting firm is independent from the Company and its management. The Committee has discussed
with the Company s independent registered public accounting firm the overall scope and plans for its audit. 

Based
on the Audit Committee s review of the matters noted above and its discussions with our independent registered public accounting
firm and our management, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board of Directors that the financial statements be included in our Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020. 

Respectfully
submitted by members of the Audit Committee:

Nominating
Committee 

The
Nominating Committee was established on May 26, 2009. The purpose of the Nominating Committee is to assist the Board of Directors in
identifying qualified individuals to become members of the Board of Directors, in making recommendations to the Board of Directors as
to the independence of each director, in monitoring significant developments in the law and practice of corporate governance and of the
duties and responsibilities of directors of public companies, and in leading the Board of Directors in any annual performance self-evaluation,
including establishing criteria to be used in connection with such evaluation. The Nominating Committee held four meetings during 2020. 

The
members of the Nominating Committee during 2019 were Joseph Chow (resigned on March 6, 2019), Xin Li (appointed on March 6, 2019 and
resigned on January 1, 2020), Feng Li (resigned on January 1, 2020) and Linyuan Zhai. Mr. Zhai served as the Chairman of the Nominating
Committee. Currently, our Nominating Committee consists of Linyuan Zhai and Huiyi Chen. Each of the above-listed Nominating Committee
members is considered independent under the current independence standards of NASDAQ Marketplace Rule 5605(a)(2) and meets
the criteria for independence set forth in Rule 10A-3(b)(1) of the Exchange Act, as determined by the Board of Directors. 

117 

The
Nominating Committee operates under a written charter. The Nominating Committee Charter can be found on our website at www.chinaxd.net
and can be made available in print free of charge to any shareholder who requests it. 

On
September 28, 2011 the Company filed a Certificate of Designation with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada (amended on January
24, 2014 and filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada on January 27, 2014), which provides the holders of the Series
D Preferred Stock with the right to elect up to two (2) directors to the Company s Board of Directors on the terms and conditions
set forth therein. On September 26, 2019, the Company amended the Certificate of Designation as a result of the mandatory conversion
(by reason of the terms of the Series D Preferred Stock), and the term of office of Series D Director nominees on the Board, namely Homer
Sun and Ryan Law, was automatically terminated. There have been no other changes to the procedures by which the stockholders of the Company
may recommend nominees to the Board of Directors since the filing of the Company s Definitive Proxy Statement on November 19, 2009
for its Annual Meeting of Stockholders, which was held on December 1, 2009. The Nominating Committee will consider director candidates
recommended by any reasonable source, including current Board of Directors members, stockholders, professional search firms or other
persons. The directors will not evaluate candidates differently based on who has made the recommendation. The Board of Directors does
not have a formal policy on Board of Directors candidate qualifications. The Board of Directors may consider those factors it deems appropriate
in evaluating director nominees made either by the Board of Directors or stockholders, including judgment, skill, strength of character,
experience with businesses and organizations comparable in size or scope to the Company, experience and skill relative to other Board
of Directors members, and specialized knowledge or experience in business or financial matters as would make such nominee an asset to
the Board of Directors and may, under certain circumstances, be required to be independent, as such term is defined in
the NASDAQ Marketplace Rules and applicable SEC regulations. Depending upon the current needs of the Board of Directors, certain factors
may be weighed more or less heavily. In considering candidates for the Board of Directors, the directors evaluate the entirety of each
candidate s credentials and do not have any specific minimum qualifications that must be met. 

Security
holders wishing to submit the name of a person as a potential nominee to the Board of Directors must send the name, address, and a brief
(no more than 500 words) biographical description of such potential nominee to the Nominating Committee at the following address: Nominating
Committee of the Board of Directors, c/o China XD Plastics Company Limited, 13620 38th Avenue, Suite 3A-1, Room 105, Flushing, New York
11354. Potential director nominees will be evaluated by personal interview, such interview to be conducted by one or more members of
the Nominating Committee, and/or any other method the Nominating Committee deems appropriate, which may, but need not, include a questionnaire.
The Nominating Committee may solicit or receive information concerning potential nominees from any source it deems appropriate. The Nominating
Committee need not engage in an evaluation process unless (i) there is a vacancy on the Board of Directors, (ii) a director is not standing
for re-election, or (iii) the Nominating Committee does not intend to recommend the nomination of a sitting director for re-election.
A potential director nominee recommended by a security holder will not be evaluated any differently than any other potential nominee.
Although it has not done so in the past, the Nominating Committee may retain search firms to assist in identifying suitable director
candidates.

ITEM
11. EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 

Compensation
Discussion and Analysis 

The
following is a discussion and analysis of our named executive officer compensation program for the year ended December 31, 2020 detailing
what we pay to our named executive officers and how our compensation objectives and policies help achieve our business objectives. 

Overview
of Compensation Program 

Our
Compensation Committee has responsibility for establishing, implementing and monitoring adherence to our compensation philosophy and
objectives. Our Compensation Committee is responsible for ensuring that the total compensation paid to our executive officers is fair,
reasonable and competitive. Our compensation decisions with respect to executive officer salaries, annual incentives and long-term incentive
opportunities are influenced by (a) the officer s level of responsibility and function; (b) our overall financial performance and,
in some cases, the officer s business unit; and (c) our assessment of the competitive marketplace, including other peer companies. 

Compensation
Philosophy and Objectives 

All
of our compensation programs, including our executive compensation programs, are designed to attract and retain key employees in the
highly competitive modified plastic marketplace in China. Our executive compensation programs are also designed to motivate our executives
to achieve and reward them for superior performance in attaining corporate and individual objectives that create stockholder value. Different
programs, including both cash and stock-based compensation, are geared towards short-term and long-term performance, respectively, with
the goal of aligning employee interests with stockholder interests and increasing stockholder value over the long term. Executive compensation
programs impact all employees by setting general levels of compensation and creating an environment of goals, reward and expectations.
Finally, we endeavor to ensure that our compensation programs are viewed as fundamentally fair to our stockholders. 

During
the year ended December 31, 2020, the compensation packages for our executives mainly included cash compensation. No bonuses or stock-based
compensation were granted as performances were short of annual goal of revenues and net income due to the weakening economic environment
and industry declining trend. 

Compensation
Programs and Process 

Elements
of Compensation 

Elements
of compensation for our named executive officers include base salary, non-equity incentive compensation, equity incentive awards, pension
plan, health, disability and life insurance and certain other perquisites. We use salary as the base amount necessary to match our competitors
for executive talent. We utilize cash incentive payments to reward performance achievements over the course of a one-year horizon and
we use equity incentive awards to reward long-term performance, with excellent corporate performance and extended tenure producing potentially
significant value for our named executive officers. We believe that this combination of programs provides an appropriate mix of fixed
and variable pay, balances short-term operational performance with long-term stockholder value, and encourages executive recruitment
and retention. 

During
the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the elements of compensation for our named executive officers include just cash salary and
a discretionary bonuses. 

120 

Compensation
Process 

Our
Compensation Committee is responsible for establishing, implementing and monitoring the compensation of our named executive officers.
When making compensation decisions, our Compensation Committee analyzes the dollar amount of each component of the executive officer s
compensation, including current cash compensation (base salary and non-equity plan incentive compensation), long-term equity incentive
program compensation, and any other compensation. 

Except
as set forth below, our Compensation Committee has not adopted any formal or informal policies or guidelines for allocating compensation
between long-term and currently paid out compensation, or between cash and non-cash compensation. However, our philosophy is to pay our
executive officers competitive levels of compensation that best reflect their individual responsibilities and contributions to us. 

We
choose to pay each element of compensation in order to attract and retain necessary talent, reward annual performance (on an individual,
business unit and enterprise-wide basis) and provide incentives for achieving long-term strategic goals as well as short-term objectives.
The amount of each element of compensation is determined by our Compensation Committee in consultation with our CEO with respect to the
other named executive officers, and, with respect to the CEO, by our Compensation Committee. Compensation decisions for all named executive
officers, on semi-annual and annual evaluations take into account of the following factors: 

Performance
against corporate and individual objectives for the previous year; 

Value
 of skills and capabilities to support our long-term performance; 

Performance
 of general management responsibilities; and 

Contribution
as a member of our executive management team. 

Base
Salary 

Base
salary levels for our named executive officers are intended to compensate executives competitively within the modified plastic marketplace
in China. Base salary rewards core competence in an executive role relative to an officer s skills, experience and contributions
to our business. Base salaries are determined on an individual basis by evaluating each executive officer s scope of responsibility,
past performance, and data on prevailing compensation levels in an appropriate market comparison group. There is no adjustment of base
salary for our named executive officers given that each of them is under a five-year term agreement with the Company. 

In
2020, pursuant to the Company s 2010 Executive Compensation Program which sets forth cash and stock compensation of the Company s
executives and directors, including the Company s named executive officers, the executive officers are entitled to receive compensation
as follows: 

Compensation

salary of 143,238 (RMB 988,000 per month from January to December. In addition, Mr. Han did not receive a discretionary bonus
as determined by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors at the end of the fiscal year due to the company-wide performance
was short of annual goal of revenues and net income due to the weakening economic environment and auto industry declining trend. 

Compensation
for Mr. Taylor Zhang, the Company s Chief Financial Officer : For fiscal year ended December 31, 2020, Mr. Zhang is entitled

shares, under our 2020 Stock Option/Stock Issuance Plan. The shares shall vest upon issuance. In addition, Mr. Zhang did not receive

2009
Stock Option / Stock Issuance Plan 

On
May 26, 2009, we adopted our 2009 Stock Option / Stock Issuance Plan, supplemented by Stock Award Grant Supplemental Provisions 
in July 2013 (the 2009 Plan ), under which 7,800,000 shares of common stock are reserved for issuance. The 2009 Plan provides
for the grant of the following types of incentive awards: (i) stock options and (ii) stock issuances. Each of these is referred to individually
as an Award. Those who are eligible for Awards under the 2009 Plan include employees, directors and independent contractors
who provide services to the Company and/or its affiliates. 

The
Board of Directors has reserved 7,800,000 shares of the common stock for issuance under the 2009 Plan. As of December 31, 2019, 4,349,376
stock awards and 1,170,500 options have been granted under the 2009 Plan. The 2009 Plan was terminated in accordance with its terms on
May 26, 2019, after which we are not allowed to grant equity awards thereunder. 

2020
Stock Option / Stock Issuance Plan 

On
January 10, 2020, we adopted our 2020 Stock Option / Stock Issuance Plan (the 2020 Plan ), under which 13,000,000 shares
of common stock are reserved for issuance. The 2020 Plan provides for the grant of the following types of incentive awards: (i) stock
options and (ii) stock issuances. Each of these is referred to individually as an Award. Those who are eligible for Awards
under the 2020 Plan include employees, directors and independent contractors who provide services to the Company and/or its affiliates. 

Number
of Shares of Common Stock Available Under the 2020 Plan 

The
Board of Directors has reserved 13,000,000 shares of the common stock for issuance under the 2020 Plan. Currently, approximately 45 employees
and directors are eligible to participate in the 2020 Plan. 

If
the Company declares a dividend or other distribution or engages in a recapitalization, stock split, reverse stock split, reorganization,
merger, consolidation, split-up, spin-off, combination, repurchase, or exchange of shares or other securities of the Company, or other
change in the corporate structure of the Company affecting the Company s common stock, the Board of Directors will adjust the number
and class of shares that may be delivered under the 2020 Plan, the number, class, and price of shares covered by each outstanding Award,
and the numerical per-person limits on Awards. 

Shares
of common stock subject to outstanding options shall be available for subsequent issuance under the 2020 Plan to the extent (1) the options
expire or terminate for any reason prior to exercise in full or (2) the options are cancelled in accordance with the 2020 Plan. Unvested
shares issued under the 2020 Plan and subsequently repurchased by the Company, at a price per share not greater than the option exercise
or direct issue price paid per share, pursuant to the Company s repurchase rights under the 2020 Plan shall be added back to the
number of shares of common stock reserved for issuance under the 2020 Plan and shall accordingly be available for reissuance through
one or more subsequent option grants or direct stock issuances under the 2020 Plan. 

Administration
of the 2020 Plan 

The
Board of Directors administers the 2020 Plan. However, any or all administrative functions otherwise exercisable by the Board of Directors
may be delegated to a committee of the Board of Directors (the Committee ). Members of the Committee serve for such period
of time as the Board of Directors may determine and shall be subject to removal by the Board of Directors at any time. The Board of Directors
may also at any time terminate the functions of the Committee and reassume all powers and authority previously delegated to the Committee.
Subject to the terms of the 2020 Plan, the Board of Directors has the sole discretion to select the employees, independent contractors,
and directors who will receive Awards, determine the terms and conditions of Awards, and to interpret the provisions of the 2020 Plan
and outstanding Awards. 

122 

Options 

The
Board of Directors is able to grant nonqualified stock options and incentive stock options under the 2020 Plan. The Board of Directors
determines the number of shares subject to each option. Incentive options may only be granted to employees. The aggregate fair market
value of the shares of common stock for which one or more options granted to any employee under the 2020 Plan may for the first time
become exercisable as incentive options during one calendar year may not exceed 100,000. 

The
Board of Directors determines the exercise price of options granted under the 2020 Plan, provided the exercise price (i) of incentive
stock options must be at least equal to the fair market value of the common stock on the date of grant and (ii) of non-statutory stock
options must be at least equal to 85 of the fair market value of the common stock on the date of grant. In addition, the exercise price
of an incentive stock option granted to any participant who owns more than 10 of the total voting power of all classes of the Company s
outstanding stock must be at least 110 of the fair market value of the common stock on the grant date. 

The
term of an option may not exceed ten years, except incentive stock options granted to an employee who is a 10 stockholder may not exceed
five years. 

Unless
otherwise determined by the Board of Directors, after a termination of service with the Company, a participant will be able to exercise
the vested portion of his or her option for (i) 90 days following his or her termination (or within such other period of time as may
be specified by the Company, but in any event no later than the date of expiration of the option term) for reasons other than death,
disability or misconduct, (ii) one year following his or her termination (or within such other period of time as may be specified by
the Company, but in any event no later than the date of expiration of the option term) due to death or disability. Unless otherwise determined
by the Board of Directors, if a participant ceases to be employed by the Company on the account of (i) termination by the Company for
defined misconduct, any option held by the participant shall (A) terminate on the date on which the participant ceases to be employed
by, or provide service to, the Company, or the date on which such option would otherwise expire, if earlier. 

The
administrator of the 2020 Plan shall have the discretion to grant options that are exercisable for unvested shares. Should the optionee s
service cease while the shares issued upon the early exercise of the optionee s option are still unvested, the Company shall have
the right to repurchase any or all of the unvested shares in accordance with the 2020 Plan. 

Stock
Issuance 

The
Board of Directors may transfer shares of Company stock to a Plan participant pursuant to a stock issuance, either through the immediate
purchase of such shares or as a bonus for services rendered the Company. Stock issuances will vest in accordance with the terms and conditions
established by the Board of Directors in its sole discretion. The Board of Directors will determine the number of shares granted pursuant
to an Award of stock. Vesting conditions on stock issuances granted to non-officer employees may not be more restrictive than 20 per
year vesting, with the initial vesting to occur no later than one year after the shares are issued. 

The
Board of Directors shall fix the purchase price per share of stock issuance. Shares issued to 10 stockholders must not have a purchase
price per share less than 100 of the fair market value per share of common stock on the date of issuance. Shares issued to other Plan
participants shall not be less than 85 of the fair market value per share of common stock on the date of issuance. 

The
participant shall have full stockholder rights with respect to any shares of common stock issued to the participant under the 2020 Plan,
whether or not the participant s interest in those shares is vested. Accordingly, the participant shall have the right to vote
such shares and to receive any regular cash dividends paid on such shares. 

123 

Should
the participant cease to remain in service while holding one or more unvested shares issued under the 2020 Plan or should the performance
objectives not be attained with respect to one or more such unvested shares, then the Company has the right to repurchase the unvested
shares at the lower of (a) the purchase price paid per share or by the participants (b) the fair market value per share on the date participant s
service ceased or the performance objective was not attained. The terms upon which such repurchase right shall be exercisable shall be
established by the Board of Directors and set forth in the document evidencing such repurchase right. 

The
Board of Directors may in its discretion waive the surrender and cancellation of one or more unvested shares (or other assets attributable
thereto) which would otherwise occur upon the non-completion of the vesting schedule applicable to those shares. Such waiver shall result
in the immediate vesting of the participant s interest in the shares of common stock as to which the waiver applies. Such waiver
may be effectuated at any time, whether before or after the Participant s service ceases or he or she attains the applicable performance
objectives. 

Transferability
of Awards 

Except
as described below, Stock Option Awards granted under the 2020 Plan are generally not transferable, and all rights with respect to a
Stock Option Award granted to a participant generally will be available during a participant s lifetime only to the participant.
A participant may not transfer those rights except by will or by the laws of descent and distribution. Participant may transfer non-statutory
stock options to family members, or one or more trusts or other entities for the benefit of or owned by family members or to a transferee s
former spouse, consistent with applicable securities laws, provided that the participant receives no consideration for the transfer of
an option and the transferred option shall continue to be subject to the same terms and conditions as were applicable to the option immediately
before the transfer. 

The
Company has the right of first refusal with respect to any proposed disposition by an optionee or a participant of any shares of common
stock issued under the 2020 Plan. Such right of first refusal shall be exercisable and lapse in accordance with the terms established
by the Board of Directors and set forth in the document evidencing such right. 

Change
of Control 

In
the event of a change of control, each outstanding option which is at the time outstanding will automatically become fully vested and
exercisable and be released from any restrictions on transfer and repurchase or forfeiture rights, and the restrictions and conditions
on all outstanding stock issuances will lapse immediately prior to the specified effective date of such change of control, for all of
the shares at the time represented by such option or stock issuance. An outstanding option shall not fully vest and be exercisable and
released from such limitations and a stock issuance will not be released from such restrictions and restrictions on stock issuances if
and to the extent: (i) such option or stock issuance is, in connection with the change in control, either to be assumed by the successor
corporation or parent thereof or to be replaced with a comparable option, stock appreciation right or stock issuance with respect to
shares of the capital stock of the successor corporation or parent thereof, or (ii) such option or stock issuance is to be replaced with
a cash incentive program of the successor corporation or parent thereof which preserves the compensation element of such option or stock
issuance existing at the time of the change in control and provides for subsequent payout in accordance with the same vesting schedule
applicable to such option or stock issuance. The determination of option or stock issuance comparability under clause (i) above shall
be made by the Board of Directors. 

Effective
upon the consummation of the change of control, all outstanding options or stock issuances under the 2020 Plan will terminate and cease
to remain outstanding, except to the extent assumed by the successor company or its parent. 

Amendment
and Termination of the 2020 Plan 

The
Board of Directors has the authority to amend, alter, suspend or terminate the 2020 Plan, except that shareholder approval will be required
for any amendment to the 2020 Plan to the extent required by any applicable laws. No amendment, alteration, suspension or termination
of the 2020 Plan will impair the rights of any participant, unless mutually agreed otherwise between the participant and the Board of
Directors and which agreement must be in writing and signed by the participant and the Company. The 2020 Plan will terminate on January
10, 2030, unless the Board of Directors terminates it earlier or it is extended by the Company with the approval of the shareholders. 

Although
there may be adverse accounting consequences to doing so, options may be granted and shares may be issued under the 2020 Plan which are
in each instance in excess of the number of shares of common stock then available for issuance under the 2020 Plan, provided any excess
shares actually issued under those programs shall be held in escrow until there is obtained stockholder approval of an amendment sufficiently
increasing the number of shares of common stock available for issuance under the 2020 Plan. If such stockholder approval is not obtained
within twelve months after the date the first such excess grants or issuances are made, then (1) any unexercised options granted on the
basis of such excess shares shall terminate and (2) the Company shall promptly refund to the optionees and the participants the exercise
or purchase price paid for any excess shares issued under the 2020 Plan and held in escrow, together with interest (at the applicable
Short Term Federal Rate) for the period the shares were held in escrow, and such shares shall thereupon be automatically cancelled.

REPORT
OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

To
the shareholders and the board of directors of China XD Plastics Company Limited 

Opinion
on the Financial Statements 

We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of China XD Plastics Company Limited and its subsidiaries (the Company as of December 31, 2020, the related consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss), changes in equity, and cash flows for the
year ended December 31, 2020, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements ). In our opinion,
the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2020, and
the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the year ended December 31, 2020, in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States. 

Going
Concern Uncertainty 

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note
3 to the financial statements, the Company incurred a significant loss from operations, has recurring operating cash outflows that raise
substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might
result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

Basis
for Opinion 

These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s
financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal
securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company
is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audit
we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion
on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our
audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or
fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audit provides
a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

Critical
Audit Matter 

The
critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated
or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial
statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter
does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit
matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. 

Impairment
assessment of long-lived assets 

As
described in Note 2 to the financial statements, the Company performs an impairment assessment of its long-lived assets when events or
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable. These long-lived assets, mainly property,
plant, and equipment, and long-term prepayments to equipment and construction supplies, have a carrying value of 1,291 million as of
December 31, 2020. As disclosed in Note 26, the Company recognized impairment losses for these assets of approximately
 187 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. 

Auditing
the valuation of long-lived assets involved complex judgment due to subjective evaluation of indicators and significant estimations required
in determining the recoverability the long-lived assets. Specifically, the cash flow forecasts were sensitive to significant assumptions
about future market and economic conditions. Significant assumptions used in the Company s estimates included sales volume, growth
rates, gross profits, operating expenditures, tax rates, and discount rate, as applicable. 

Our
audit of impairment assessment of long-lived assets includes, but not limits to, the following procedures: 

understanding of the controls over
 the Company s annual impairment assessments of long-lived assets; 

comparing, by searching online information, management s assessment in qualitative factors, to public information
including economic growth forecast, industry outlook, and business environment, relating to the long-lived assets; 

testing
 the estimated future cash flows, including but not limited to, comparing significant inputs to observable third party and industrial
 sources, comparing to the historical performance of the Company, and evaluating the reasonableness of management s projected
 financial information by comparing to observable average industry historical trends and projections, and other internal and external
 data. 

performing sensitivity analyses
 of significant assumptions to evaluate the reasonableness of the Company s cash flow
 analyses generated by the long-lived assets that have been placed in use; 

confirming
 and interviewing with suppliers regarding the status of prepayments for equipment and the Company s plans to continue the uncompleted
 construction projects; 

assessing
 the Company s disclosure of its impairment assessments included in Note 2 as well as the sufficiency of footnote disclosure
 of impairment of long-term prepayments in Note 9 and impairment loss of long-lived assets in Note 26.

2019, the related consolidated statements of comprehensive loss, changes in equity and cash flows for the year ended December 31,
2019, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2019, and the results of its
operations and its cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2019, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 

Changes
in Accounting Principle 

As
discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, as of January 1, 2019, the Company has changed its method of accounting
for leases due to the adoption of ASC Topic 842, Leases. 

Basis
for Opinion 

These
consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion
on these consolidated financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal
securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud.
The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part
of our audit, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing
an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our
audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due
to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence
regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements.
We believe that our audit provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Acid PLA , Poly Ether Ether Ketone PEEK and Polyethylene PE . 

The
Company s operations are primarily conducted through its subsidiaries in the People s Republic of China PRC and Dubai, United Arab Emirates UAE ). The Company s other subsidiaries in the US, the British Virgin Islands BVI and Hong Kong Special Administrative Region SAR ), do not have significant operations. 

Note
2 Summary of significant accounting policies 

(a)
Basis of Presentation 

The
accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America U.S. GAAP ). 

(b)
Consolidation 

The
accompanying consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of China XD and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant
intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated upon consolidation. 

(c)
Non-controlling interests 

Non-controlling
interests represent non-controlling shareholders 36.21 and 34.38 ownership interest in the two PRC entities as of December 31,
2020. The non-controlling interests are presented in the consolidated balance sheets, separately from equity attributable to the shareholders
of the Company. Non-controlling interests in the results of the Company are presented on the face of the consolidated statements of operations
and comprehensive income as an allocation of the total income or loss for the year ended December 31, 2020 between non-controlling interest
holders and the shareholders of the Company. 

(d)
Use of Estimates 

The
preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements
and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant
items subject to such estimates and assumptions include the recoverability of the carrying amounts of long-term assets, including property,
plant and equipment, the realizability of inventories, the useful lives of property, plant and equipment, the collectability of accounts
receivable, the fair values of stock-based compensation, realizability of deferred tax assets, the accruals for tax uncertainties and
other contingencies, and the discount rate used to determine the present value of the lease payments. The current economic environment
has increased the degree of uncertainty inherent in those estimates and assumptions. 

F- 8 

(e)
Foreign Currency 

The
Company s reporting currency is the U.S. dollar (US ). The functional currency of China XD Plastics and its subsidiaries in the
United States, BVI, Hong Kong and Dubai, UAE is the US . The functional currency of China XD s subsidiaries in the PRC is Renminbi
(RMB). 

Transactions
denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rates prevailing
at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the functional
currency using the applicable exchange rates at the balance sheet date. The resulting exchange differences are recorded in foreign currency
exchange gain or loss in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss). 

Assets
and liabilities of subsidiaries with functional currencies other than US are translated into US using the exchange rate on the balance
sheet date. Revenues and expenses are translated into US at average rates prevailing during the reporting period. The differences resulting
from such translation are recorded as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) within stockholders 
equity. 

Since
the RMB is not a fully convertible currency, all foreign exchange transactions involving RMB must take place either through the People s
Bank of China or other institutions authorized to buy and sell foreign exchange. 

(f)
Cash and cash equivalents, time deposits and restricted cash 

Cash
and cash equivalents consist of cash on hand, cash in bank and interest-bearing certificates of deposit with an initial term of three
months or less when purchased. 

Time
deposits represent certificates of deposit with initial terms of six or twelve months when purchased. 

Cash
deposits in bank that are restricted as to withdrawal or usage for up to 12 months are reported as restricted cash in the consolidated
balance sheets. 

F- 9 

(g)
Accounts Receivable 

Accounts
receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest. The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for
estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments. In establishing the required allowance, management
considers historical losses, the amount of accounts receivables in dispute, the accounts receivables aging and the customers payment
patterns. Account balances are written off against the allowance after all means of collection have been exhausted and the potential
for recovery is considered remote. The Company does not have any off-balance-sheet credit exposure related to its customers. 

(h)
Inventories 

Inventories
are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is determined using the weighted average cost method. Work-in-progress
and finish goods comprise direct materials (including purchasing, receiving and inspection costs), direct labor and an allocation of
related manufacturing overhead based on normal operating capacity. 

(i)
Long-lived Assets 

Property,
plant and equipment 

Property,
plant and equipment are initially recorded at cost. Depreciation is calculated on the straight-line method over the estimated useful
lives of the assets. The estimated useful lives of property, plant and equipment are as follows: 

Estimated Useful Life 
 
 Workshops and buildings 
 39 years 
 
 Machinery, equipment and furniture 
 5-10 years 
 
 Motor vehicles 
 5 years 

An
appropriate allocation of depreciation expense of property, plant and equipment attributable to manufacturing activities based on normal
capacity is capitalized as part of the cost of inventory, and expensed in cost of revenues when the inventory is sold. Costs incurred
in the construction of property, plant and equipment, including an allocation of interest expense incurred, are capitalized and transferred
into their respective asset category when the assets are ready for their intended use, at which time depreciation commences. Ordinary
maintenance and repairs are charged to expenses as incurred, while replacements and betterments are capitalized. When items are retired
or otherwise disposed of, income is charged or credited for the difference between net book value of the item disposed and proceeds realized
thereon. 

F- 10 

(j)
Impairment of Long-lived Assets 

Long-lived
assets, such as property, plant and equipment, and operating lease right-of-use assets, are reviewed for impairment when events or changes
in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable. Recoverability of a long-lived asset or asset
group to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset or asset group to the estimated undiscounted
future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or asset group. If the carrying value of an asset or asset group exceeds its
estimated undiscounted future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized by the amount that the carrying value exceeds the estimated
fair value of the asset or asset group. Fair value is determined through various valuation techniques including discounted cash flow
models, quoted market values and third party independent appraisals, as considered necessary. Assets to be disposed are reported at the
lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell, and are no longer depreciated. 

Impairment
charges of US 165.3 million were recognized for long-lived assets during the year ended December 31, 2020 (See Note 26). 

(k)
Revenue Recognition 

The
Company adopted the new guidance of ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), which requires the Company to recognize
revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity
expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The Company applies the following steps to recognize revenues: (1) identify
the contract with a customer; (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determine the transaction price; (4) allocate
the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (5) recognize revenue when, or as, the Company satisfies a
performance obligation. 

Products
sales 

The
Company recognizes revenue upon transfer of control of its products to the customers, which typically occurs upon delivery. The Company s
main performance obligation to its customers is the delivery of products in accordance with purchase orders. Each purchase order defines
the transaction price for the products purchased under the arrangement. The Company sells its products primarily to the distributors
and to a lesser extent to the direct customers. For sales in the People s Republic of China PRC ), acceptance of
delivery of the products by the distributors is evidenced by goods receipt notes signed by the distributors customers (or end
users). The distributors accept the products at the time they are delivered to the distributors customers (or end customers).
Delivery acceptance is evidenced by signed goods receipt notes. The Company has no remaining obligations after the distributors 
acceptance of the products. Under the terms of the contracts or purchase orders between the Company and the distributors, the control
of the products is transferred to the distributor upon the signing of the goods receipt notes and the distributor has no rights to return
the products (other than for defective products). For sales to the overseas customers, delivery of the products occurs at the point in
time the product is delivered to the named port of shipment, which is when the control of the products is transferred to the customer. 

The
selling price, which is specified in the purchase orders, is fixed. Under the terms of the purchase orders, upon the sale of the products
to the distributors and the signing of the good receipts notes, the Company has the legal enforceable right to receive full payment of
the sales price. The distributors obligation to pay the Company is not dependent on the distributors selling the products or collecting
cash from their customers (or end customers). The customer is required to pay under normal sales terms. The Company s normal payment
terms in most cases are 90 days and its sales arrangements do not have any material financing components. In addition, the Company s
customer arrangements do not produce contract assets or liabilities that are material to its consolidated financial statements. 

F- 11 

Incremental
costs to fulfill the Company s customer arrangements are expensed as incurred, as the amortization period is less than one year. 

The
Company s sales are net of value added tax VAT and business tax and surcharges collected on behalf of tax authorities
in respect of product sales. VAT and business tax and surcharges collected from customers, net of VAT paid for purchases, is recorded
as a liability in the consolidated balance sheets until it is paid to the tax authorities. 

Outbound
freight and Handling costs: 

The
company accounts for product outbound freight and handling costs as fulfillment activities and present the associated costs in costs
of goods sold in the period in which it sells the product. 

Disaggregation
of Revenues: 

The
company manufactures and sells modified plastics primarily for automotive applications in China and to a lesser extent, in Dubai, United
Arab Emirates UAE ). The Company disaggregates revenue based on its major customer grouping as this category represents
the most appropriate depiction of how the nature, amount, and timing of revenues and cash flows are affected by economic factors. Sales
by major customer group are as follows: 

Distributors
 represents sales to the distributors, who re-sell our products to end customers. 

Direct
customers represents sales sold directly to customers in automotive applications and electrical appliances industry. 

Others
 mainly represents agent fee of raw material trading. 

The
following tables provide sales by major customer group for years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:

(l)
Cost of Revenues 

Cost
of revenues represents costs of raw materials (including purchasing, receiving and inspection costs), packaging materials, labor, utilities,
depreciation and amortization of manufacturing facilities and warehouses, handling costs, outbound freight and inventory write-down.
Depreciation and amortization of manufacturing facilities and warehouses attributable to manufacturing activities is capitalized as part
of the cost of inventory, and expensed in costs of revenues when the inventory is sold. 

(m)
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 

Selling
expenses represents primarily costs of payroll, benefits, commissions for sales representatives and advertising expenses. General and
administrative expenses represent primarily payroll and benefits costs for administrative employees, rent and operating costs of office
premises, depreciation and amortization of office facilities, and other administrative expenses. 

(n)
Research and Development Expense 

Research
and development costs are expensed as incurred. 

(o)
Government Grants 

Government
grants are recognized when there is reasonable assurance that the Company will comply with the conditions attaching to them and the grants
will be received. Government grants for the purpose of giving immediate financial support to the Company with no future related costs
are recognized as other income in the Company s consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss). Government grants related
to the acquisition of assets are recorded as deferred income on the consolidated balance sheets when the grants become receivable, and
recognized as other income in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss) on a straight-line basis over the estimated
useful lives of those assets. 

F- 12 

(p)
Income Taxes 

Income
taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future
tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and
their respective tax bases and tax operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured
using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the periods in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered
or settled. The effect of a change in tax rates or tax laws on deferred income tax assets and liabilities is recognized in the consolidated
statements of comprehensive income (loss) in the period the change in tax rates or tax laws is enacted. A valuation allowance is provided
to reduce the carrying amount of deferred income tax assets if it is considered more likely than not that some portion or all of the
deferred income tax assets will not be realized. 

The
Company recognizes in the consolidated financial statements the impact of a tax position, if that position is more likely than not of
being sustained upon examination, based on the technical merits of the position. Recognized income tax positions are measured at the
largest amount that is greater than 50 likely of being realized. Changes in recognition or measurement are reflected in the period in
which the change in judgment occurs. The Company has elected to classify interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits,
if and when required, as part of interest expense, and general and administration expenses, respectively in the consolidated statements
of comprehensive income (loss). 

(q)
Bills Payable 

Bills
payable represent bills issued by financial institutions to the Company s raw material suppliers. The Company s suppliers
receive payments from the financial institutions upon maturity of the bills and the Company is obliged to repay the face value of the
bills to the financial institutions. 

(r)
Employee Benefit Plans 

Pursuant
to relevant PRC regulations, the Company is required to make contributions to various defined contribution plans organized by municipal
and provincial PRC governments. The contributions are made for each PRC employee at rate of approximately 40 on a standard salary base
as determined by local social security bureau. Contributions to the defined contribution plans are charged to the consolidated statements
of comprehensive income (loss) when the related service is provided. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the costs of the
Company s contributions to the defined contribution plans amounted to US 1,109,658 and US 2,236,528, respectively. 

For
the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, 49 and 52 of costs of employee benefits were recorded in general and administration expenses,
respectively, with the remaining portion of costs of employee benefits in selling expenses, research and development expenses and cost
of revenues each year. 

The
Company has no other obligation for the payment of employee benefits associated with these plans beyond the contributions described above. 

F- 13 

(s)
Stock Based Compensation 

The
Company measures the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value
of the award and recognizes the cost over the period during which the employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award,
which generally is the vesting period. The amount of cost recognized is adjusted to reflect any expected forfeitures prior to vesting.
The Company recognizes compensation cost for an award with only service conditions that has a graded vesting schedule on a straight-line
basis over the requisite service period for the entire award, provided that the cumulative amount of compensation cost recognized at
any date at least equals the portion of the grant-date value of such award that is vested at that date. 

(t)
Commitments and Contingencies 

In
the normal course of business, the Company is subject to loss contingencies, such as legal proceedings and claims arising out of its
business, that cover a wide range of matters, including, among others, government investigations, shareholder lawsuits, product and environmental
liability, and non-income tax matters. An accrual for a loss contingency is recognized when it is probable that a liability has been
incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. 

(u)
Earnings per Share 

Basic
earnings per share EPS is computed by dividing net income attributable to common stockholders by the weighted average
number of common stock outstanding during the year using the two-class method. Under the two-class method, net income attributable to
common stockholders is allocated between common stock and other participating securities based on participating rights in undistributed
earnings. Nonvested shares and redeemable Series D convertible preferred stock are participating securities since the holders of these
securities participate in dividends on the same basis as common stockholders. Diluted EPS is calculated by dividing net income attributable
to common stockholders as adjusted for the effect of dilutive common stock equivalent, if any, by the weighted average number of common
stock and dilutive common stock equivalent outstanding during the year. Potential dilutive securities are not included in the calculation
of diluted earnings per share if the impact is anti-dilutive. 

(v)
Segment Reporting 

The
Company uses the management approach in determining reportable operating segments. The management approach considers the internal reporting
used by the Company s chief operating decision maker for making operating decisions about the allocation of resources of the segment
and the assessment of its performance in determining the Company s reportable operating segments. Management has determined that
the Company has one operating segment, which is the modified plastics segment. 

(w)
Fair Value Measurements 

The
Company utilizes valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs to the extent
possible. The Company determines fair value based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability
in the principal or most advantageous market. When considering market participant assumptions in fair value measurements, the following
fair value hierarchy distinguishes between observable and unobservable inputs, which are categorized in one of the following levels: 

-
 Level 1 Inputs: Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities accessible to the reporting entity
at the measurement date. 

-
 Level 2 Inputs : Other than quoted prices included in Level 1 inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly
or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the asset or liability. 

-
 Level 3 Inputs : Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability used to measure fair value to the extent that observable inputs
are not available, thereby allowing for situations in which there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability at measurement
date. 

F- 14 

The
level in the fair value hierarchy within which a fair value measurement in its entirety falls is based on the lowest level input that
is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. 

The
Company did not have any financial assets and liabilities or nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are measured and recognized at
fair value on a recurring or nonrecurring basis as of December 31, 2020 and 2019. Management used the following methods and assumptions
to estimate the fair values of financial instruments at the balance sheet dates: 

-
Short-term financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts receivable, amounts due from a related
party, short-term bank loans, bills payable, accounts payable, amounts due to related parties and accrued expenses and other current
liabilities- carrying amounts approximate fair values because of the short maturity of these instruments. 

-
Long-term bank loans-fair value is based on the amount of future cash flows associated with each loan discounted at the Company s
current borrowing rate for similar debt instruments of comparable terms. The carrying value of the long-term bank loans approximate their
fair values as the long-term bank loans carry interest rates which approximate rates currently offered by the Company s banks for
similar debt instruments of comparable maturities. 

-
Derivative liabilities on foreign currency option contracts-fair values are determined using Black-Scholes model. It considers the following
significant inputs: risk-free rate, foreign exchange rate and volatility.

Recently Issued Accounting Standards 

In
February 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-02, Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income ASU
2018-02 ). The new guidance allows a reclassification from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings for stranded
tax effects resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and will improve the usefulness of information reported to financial statement users.
The Company has adopted the standard on January 1, 2019, and there was no material impact on its consolidated financial statements as
a result of the adoption. 

In
June 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-07, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Nonemployee Share-Based Payment
Accounting ASU 2018-07 ). The new guidance largely aligns the accounting for share-based awards issued to employees and
nonemployees. Existing guidance for employee awards will apply to non-employee share-based transactions with limited exceptions. The
new guidance also clarifies that any share-based payment awards issued to customers should be evaluated under ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts
with Customers. The Company has adopted the standard on January 1, 2019, and there was no material impact on its consolidated financial
statements as a result of the adoption. 

In
June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial
Instruments ASU 2016-13 ), which replaces the current incurred loss impairment methodology with a methodology that reflects
expected credit losses for financial assets. In October 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-10, which amended the effective dates that were
originally required by ASU 2016-13 for certain entities. The Company determined it was eligible as a smaller reporting company (SRC)
under the SEC s definition based on an its most recent SRC determination as of November 15, 2019 in accordance with SEC regulations
and will adopt ASU 2016-13 on January 1, 2023. 

F- 15 

In
August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-13, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosure Framework - Changes to the Disclosure Requirements
for Fair Value Measurement ASU 2018-13 ), which modifies the disclosure requirements on fair value measurements. The Company
has adopted the standard on January 1, 2020, and there was no material impact on its consolidated financial statements as a result of
the adoption. 

In
December 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740) Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes .
 ASU 2019-12 is intended to simplify accounting for income taxes. It removes certain exceptions to the general principles in Topic
740 and amends existing guidance to improve consistent application. ASU 2019-12 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December
15, 2020 and interim periods within those fiscal years, which is fiscal 2021 for us, with early adoption permitted. The Company does
not expect the adoption of the new guidance to have a significant impact on its consolidated financial statements. 

In
November 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-10, Financial Instruments Credit Losses (Topic 326), Derivatives and Hedging (Topic
815), and Leases (Topic 842) ASU 2019-10 ). ASU 2019-10 (i) provides a framework to stagger effective dates for
future major accounting standards and (ii) amends the effective dates for certain major new accounting standards to give implementation
relief to certain types of entities. Specifically, ASU 2019-10 changes some effective dates for certain new standards on the following
topics in the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (ASC): (a) Derivatives and Hedging (ASC 815) now effective for fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 2020 and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021; (b) Leases (ASC 842) - now
effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020 and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021;
(c) Financial Instruments Credit Losses (ASC 326) - now effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, including
interim periods within those fiscal years; and (d) Intangibles Goodwill and Other (ASC 350) - now effective for fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company does not expect the cumulative effect
resulting from the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. 

In
February 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-02, Financial Instruments Credit Losses (Topic 326) and Leases (topic 842) Amendments
to SEC Paragraphs Pursuant to SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 119 and Update to SEC Section on Effective Date Related to Accounting
Standards Update No. 2016-02, Leases (topic 842) . This ASU provides guidance regarding methodologies, documentation, and internal
controls related to expected credit losses. This ASU is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019, and
early adoption is permitted. The Company is evaluating the impact of this guidance on its consolidated financial statements. 

Note
3-Liquidity 

As
reflected in the Company s consolidated financial statements, the Company had working capital of approximately US 114.5 million
and current ratio of 1.1 as of December 31, 2020. 

As
of December 31, 2020, we have contractual obligations to pay (i) lease commitments in the amount of US 26.3 million, including US 1.4
million due in one year; (ii) equipment acquisition and facility construction in the amount of US 250.2 million; (iii) long-term
bank loan in the amount of US 727.3 million (including principals and interests). 

The
Company also had large unpaid tax liabilities of approximately 107.8 million, including US 36.1 within one year. Furthermore, the ongoing
outbreak of COVID-19 may continue to negatively impact the Company s business operations. A resurgence could negatively affect
the Company s ability to fulfill customer sales orders and collect customer payments timely, or disrupt the Company s supply
chain. As a result, there is a possibility that the Company s revenue and cash flows may underperform in the next 12 months. 

As
seen in the Company s financial statements, for the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company had a significant loss of US 181.7
million primarily due to an impairment of long-lived assets of US 165.3 million for Dubai Xinda and had recurring operating cash outflows
of US 3.0 million. These conditions raised substantial doubts about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. 

In
assessing its liquidity, management monitors and analyzes the Company s cash on-hand, its ability to generate sufficient revenue
sources in the future, and its operating and capital expenditure commitments. The Company had cash and cash equivalents and restricted
cash of approximately US 188.3 million and accumulated retained earnings of approximately US 538.4 million. The Company also had outstanding
accounts receivable of approximately 423.9 million, of which approximately US 410.8 million or 96.9 has been subsequently collected
as of the date of this report. Cash collection from accounts receivable become available for use as working capital. 

Currently,
the Company is working to improve its liquidity and capital sources primarily through cash flows from operation, debt financing, and
financial support from its principal shareholder. 

F- 16 

As
of December 31, 2020, the Company had lines of credit of RMB11,165.7 million (equivalent to US 1,711.2 million) and unused line of credit
of USD107.0 million. Management expects that it would be able to renew all of its existing bank loans upon their maturity based on past
experience and the Company s good credit history. On September 29, 2021, the Company obtained another line of credit of RMB1,400
million (equivalent to US 214. 6 million) from Longjiang Bank, Harbin as working capital lo and withdrew RMB200 million (equivalent to
US 30.7 million) (See Note 31). 

The
Company plans to fund its construction of new facilities in a controlled and gradual manner, and by obtaining additional bank financing
and reducing costs to improve profitability and improve working capital. The Company s ability to fulfill its current obligations
will depend on the future realization of its current assets and the future revenues generated from its operations. 

The
Company expects to realize the balance of its current assets within the normal operating cycle of a twelve month period. If the Company
is unable to realize its current assets within the normal operating cycle of a twelve month period, the Company had considered supplementing
its available sources of funds through continuously seeking debt financing from PRC banks and other financial institutions to support
its expansion plan. 

Based
on the current operating plan, management believes that the above-mentioned measures collectively will most likely
have sufficient funds to pursue its expansion plan as previously expected. There is no assurance that management will be successful in
their plans. There are a number of factors that could potentially arise that could undermine the Company s plans, such as changes
in the PRC government policy, economic conditions, and competitive pricing in the industries that the Company operates in. In addition,
the recent outbreak of new coronavirus pandemic posed disruption and restrictions on its operations and those of the Company s
customers which not only negatively impact the Company s financial conditions but also slowed down the macro-economic development
worldwide. If management is unable to execute this plan, there would likely be a material adverse effect on the Company s business.

Harbin
Xinda Macromolecule Material Research Institute Research Institute was established with a registered capital of approximately
US 0.4 million in 2007. The Research Institute provided research and development services to the Company s ultimate end customers.
In December 2010, for tax purposes and because the Research Institute could not meet the Company s development needs, the Company
dissolved the Research Institute and formed a new legal entity, Heilongjiang Xinda Enterprise Group Macromolecule Materials R D Center
Company Limited Research Center ). Based on applicable regulations promulgated by the local Civil Affairs Bureau, only
the local government has the authority for the distribution of the assets of the Research Institute upon liquidation. Therefore, the
Company dissolved the Research Institute by distributing the net assets of the Research Institute in the amount of US 84.0 million to
the local government. The difference between the net assets in the amount of US 84.0 million and the amount of the initial registered
capital of US 0.4 million represents undistributed accumulated profit generated by the Research Institute from its inception date to
its liquidation date. Simultaneously, the local government granted the net assets back to the Harbin Xinda Plastics Material Research
Center Company Limited Xinda Material Research Center ), the newly established subsidiary of Harbin Xinda in December 2010.
The Research Center was established with a registered capital of approximately US 0.5 million funded by cash. A loss equal to the net
assets of the Research Institute distributed to the local government was recognized in other expenses and a government grant for the
receipts of the same assets back from the local government was recognized as other income in the consolidated statements of comprehensive
income (loss). Pursuant to the local tax regulations, the net assets granted to the Research Center are not subject to income tax to
the extent the Research Center spends a total of US 84.0 million in five years from the date of grant. The expenditures of US 84.0 million
will not be deductible for income tax purposes. As a result, the Company recognized a deferred income tax liability in the amount of
US 21.5 million in connection with the net assets granted to the Research Center as of December 31, 2010. To the extent that the Company
has spent on research and development equipment during the five years from the date of grant, deferred income tax liabilities relating
to the net assets of Research Institute granted to Research Center will be reclassified to deferred income tax liabilities relating to
property, plant and equipment, and recognized in profit or loss over the useful life of the asset. The Company spent a total of US 84.0
million on research and development equipment by the end of December 31, 2015, and the deferred income tax liabilities was US 3,171,643and
US 4,613,524 as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.

The
valuation allowance as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 was primarily provided for the deferred income tax assets of certain entities, which
were at cumulative loss positions. As of December 31, 2020, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the Company had tax loss carry forwards
of (i) US 28,649,345 from subsidiaries in the PRC, of which US 5,431,116, US 5,177,047 and US 2,018,821 would expire by 2023, 2024 and
2025, respectively, if unused, and (ii) US 114,800,121from subsidiaries in HK, which could be carried forward indefinitely to be offset
against future profits. In view of the cumulative losses for the entities concerned, 100 valuation allowances were provided against
their deferred income tax assets as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, which in the judgment of the management, are not more likely than
not to be realized.

annual effective tax rate. 

The
Company recognizes interest accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits in interest expense and does not recognize penalties. During
the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company recognized approximately US 4,603,509 and US 1,819,859 interest expense. The
Company had approximately US 15,565,560 and US 13,774,161 for the interest accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits amounting to
US 37,071,419 and US 34,706,069 as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. US 6,046,897 previously unrecognized tax benefits accrued
in year 2014 and the related accrued interest amounting to US 5,442,207 were reversed during the year ended December 31, 2020 due to
the expiration of five-year tax assessment period on May 31, 2020. The unrecognized tax benefits in year 2014 amounting to US 5,655,714
and related accrued interest amounting to US 4,665,964 were classified as current liabilities as the five-year tax assessment period
will expire on May 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, nil and nil of unrecognized tax benefit were presented as a reduction
of the deferred income tax assets for tax loss carry forwards since the uncertain tax position would reduce the tax loss carry forwards
under the tax law. The unrecognized tax benefits represent the estimated income tax expenses the Company would be required to pay, should
the income tax rate used, taxable income and deductible expenses for tax purpose recognized in accordance with tax laws and regulations.
The Company is currently unable to provide an estimate of a range of the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits that is reasonably
possible to change significantly within the next twelve months. 

The
PRC tax authorities, US tax authorities and Hong Kong tax authorities have up to five years, three years and six years, respectively,
to conduct examinations of the Company s tax filings. Accordingly, the PRC subsidiaries tax years 2016 through 2020, the
US subsidiaries tax years 2018 through 2020 and the Hong Kong subsidiaries tax years 2015 through 2020 remain open to examination
by the respective taxing jurisdictions.

22 Statutory reserves 

Under
PRC rules and regulations, all subsidiaries of China XD in the PRC are required to appropriate 10 of their net income, as determined
in accordance with PRC accounting rules and regulations, to a statutory surplus reserve until the reserve balance reaches 50 of their
registered capital. The appropriation to this statutory surplus reserve must be made before distribution of dividends to China XD can
be made. The statutory reserve is non-distributable, other than during liquidation, and can be used to fund previous years losses, if
any, and may be converted into share capital by issuing new shares to existing shareholders in proportion to their shareholding or by
increasing the par value of the shares currently outstanding, provided that the remaining balance of the statutory reserve after such
issue is not less than 25 of the registered capital. 

For
the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, China XD s subsidiaries in the PRC made appropriations to the reserve fund of RMB11.7
million (equivalent to US 1.7 million) and RMB26.0 million (equivalent to US 3.8 million), respectively. As of December 31, 2020 and
2019, the accumulated balance of the statutory surplus reserve was RMB358.4 million (equivalent to US 55.1 million) and RMB346.7 million
(equivalent to US 53.4 million), respectively.

23 Risks and uncertainties 

Sales
concentration 

The
Company sells its products primarily through approved distributors in the People s Republic of China (the PRC ). The
Company s sales are concentrated. Sales to distributors individually exceeded 10 of the Company s revenues, for the years
ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, are as follows:

 13.9 

Any
factor adversely affecting the automobile industry in the PRC or the business operations of these customers will have a material effect
on the Company s business, financial position and results of operations. 

Purchase
concentration of raw materials 

The
principal raw materials used for the Company s production of modified plastics products are plastic resins, such as polypropylene,
ABS and nylon. The Company purchases substantially all of its raw materials through a limited number of distributors. Raw material purchases
from these distributors, which individually exceeded 10 of the Company s total raw material purchases, accounted for approximately
23.2 (two distributors) and 14.7 (one distributor) of the Company s total raw material purchases for the years ended December
31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Management believes that other suppliers could provide similar raw materials on comparable terms. A
change in suppliers, however, could cause a delay in manufacturing and a possible loss of sales, which would adversely affect the Company s
business, financial position and results of operations.
