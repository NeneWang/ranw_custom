 Item 1. Business 
 
 General Description of Business 
 Nordson is an innovative precision technology company that leverages a scalable growth framework to deliver top tier growth with leading margins and returns. We engineer, manufacture and market differentiated products and systems used for precision dispensing, applying and controlling of adhesives, coatings, polymers, sealants, biomaterials, and other fluids, to test and inspect for quality, and to treat and cure surfaces and various medical products such as: catheters, cannulae, medical balloons and medical tubing.. These products are supported with extensive application expertise and direct global sales and service. We serve a wide variety of consumer non-durable, consumer durable and technology end markets including packaging, electronics, medical, appliances, energy, transportation, building and construction, and general product assembly and finishing. 
 Our strategy for long-term growth is based on solving customers needs globally. We were incorporated in the State of Ohio in 1954 and are headquartered in Westlake, Ohio. Our products are marketed through a network of direct operations in more than 35 countries. Consistent with this global strategy, approximately 67 percent of our revenues were generated outside the United States in 2021. 
 We have 6,813 employees worldwide. Principal manufacturing facilities are located in the United States, the People s Republic of China, Germany, Ireland, Israel, Mexico, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom. 
 COVID-19 Pandemic Update 
 In December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus ("COVID-19") emerged and has since spread to other countries, including the United States. In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 as a pandemic (the "COVID-19 pandemic"). The COVID-19 pandemic, including multiple variants, has resulted in governments around the world implementing stringent measures to help control the spread of the virus, including quarantines, shelter in place and stay at home orders, travel restrictions, business interruptions and other measures. 
 Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, we have supported, and continue to support, multiple critical infrastructure sectors by manufacturing materials and products needed for medical supply chains, packaging, transportation, energy, communications, and other critical infrastructure industries. We have benefited from our geographical and product diversification as the end markets we serve have remained resilient in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and we continue to invest in the businesses, people, and strategies necessary to achieve our long-term priorities as we focus on driving profitable growth. We have continued to operate during the COVID-19 pandemic in all our production facilities, having taken the recommended public health measures to ensure worker and workplace safety. As a result, there have been unfavorable impacts on our manufacturing efficiencies. Additionally, we are taking steps to offset cost increases from COVID-19 pandemic-related supply chain disruptions. For more information on how we have modified our business practices during the COVID-19 pandemic, see Human Capital Resources below. 
 We continue to actively monitor the rapidly evolving circumstances and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has negatively disrupted, and may continue to negatively disrupt, our business and results of operations in the future. The full extent of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations and the markets we serve remains highly uncertain and will depend largely on future developments related to the COVID-19 pandemic, including infection rates increasing or returning in various geographic areas, variations of COVID-19, the ultimate duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, actions by government authorities to contain the outbreak or treat its impact, such as reimposing previously lifted measures or putting in place additional restrictions, and the widespread distribution and acceptance of an effective vaccine, among other things. These developments are constantly evolving and cannot be accurately predicted. See Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors in this report. 
 New Secretary and General Counsel 
 On October 12, 2021, we announced that Jennifer McDonough had been named Executive Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary, effective November 1, 2021. Ms. McDonough succeeded Gina Beredo, who left the Company to pursue a new opportunity.

 Corporate Purpose and Goals 
 We strive to be a vital, self-renewing, worldwide organization that, within the framework of ethical behavior and enlightened citizenship, grows and produces wealth for our customers, employees, shareholders, and communities. 
 We operate for the purpose of creating balanced, long-term benefits for all of our constituencies. 
 We focus on long-term growth and returns. Each quarter, we may not produce increased sales, net income, or earnings per share, or exceed the comparative prior year's quarter. When short-term swings occur, we do not intend to alter our foundational objectives in efforts to mitigate the impact of these temporary occurrences. 
 In 2021, we launched the Ascend strategy, which is designed to deliver top tier revenue growth with attractive margins and returns. Ascend is driven by three interconnected pillars: the NBS (Nordson Business System) Next growth framework; Owner Mindset, our division-led organizational structure; and Winning Teams, our talent strategy. These three pillars are built upon the foundation of what makes Nordson special: our culture and our values. 
 The NBS Next growth framework, the heart of the Ascend strategy, uses data-based segmentation to identify our greatest opportunities for profitable growth and ensure we are investing our resources disproportionately in those areas. Using data in a consistent and disciplined way, leaders across the Company are defining their strategic business priorities. 
 We drive organic growth by continually introducing new products and technology, providing high levels of customer service and support, capturing rapidly expanding opportunities in emerging geographies, and by leveraging existing technology into new applications. Additional growth comes through the acquisition of companies that have differentiated precision technology based product portfolio, serve attractive high-growth end-markets applications and have a customer-centric business model. The primary goals of our acquisition strategy are to complement our current capabilities, diversify our business into new industry sectors with new customers and expand the scope of the solutions we can offer to our customers. 
 We strive to provide genuine customer satisfaction it is the foundation upon which we continue to build our business. 
 Complementing our business strategy is the objective to provide opportunities for employee self-fulfillment, growth, security, recognition and equitable compensation. This goal is met through the Human Resources department s facilitation of employee training, leadership training and the creation of on-the-job growth opportunities. The result is a highly qualified and professional global team capable of meeting corporate objectives. For more information, see "Human Capital Resources" below. 
 We recognize the value of employee participation in the planning process. Strategic and operating plans are developed by all divisions, resulting in a sense of ownership and commitment on the part of employees in accomplishing our objectives. 
 We are an equal opportunity employer. 
 At Nordson, we have a long and proud history of investing in the communities where we live and work. We are committed to contributing approximately five percent of domestic pretax earnings to human welfare services, education and other charitable activities, particularly in communities where we have significant operations. Through the Nordson Corporation Foundation (the Foundation ), we give back by providing grants to nonprofits in communities where we have facilities employing more than 100 people. In recent years, we have extended our reach internationally, with giving programs in 11 international locations. Since 1989, we have donated more than 135 million to communities where we live and work. In addition, our employees volunteered more than 106,000 hours through our Time N Talent program. 
 
 Principal Products and Uses 
 We engineer, manufacture and market differentiated products and systems used to dispense, apply and control adhesives, coatings, polymers, sealants, biomaterials, medical components, and other fluids, to test and inspect for quality, and to treat and cure surfaces. Our precision technology can be found in manufacturing facilities around the world producing a wide range of goods for consumer durable, consumer non-durable and technology end markets. Equipment ranges from single-use components to manual, stand-alone units for low-volume operations to microprocessor-based automated systems for high-speed, high-volume production lines. 
 We market our products globally, primarily through a direct sales force, and also through qualified distributors and sales representatives. We have built a worldwide reputation for creativity and expertise in the design and engineering of high-technology application equipment that meets the specific needs of our customers. We create value for our customers by developing solutions that increase uptime, enable faster line speeds and reduce consumption of materials. We serve a broad customer base, both in terms of industries and geographic regions. In 2021, no single customer accounted for ten percent or more of sales.

 Nordson Corporation 6 

Table of Contents 

 Principal materials used to make our products are metals and plastics, typically in sheets, bar stock, castings, forgings, tubing and pellets. We also purchase many electrical and electronic components, fabricated metal parts, high-pressure fluid hoses, packings, seals and other items integral to our products. Suppliers are competitively selected based on cost, quality and service. All significant raw materials that we use are available through multiple sources. We purchase most raw materials and other components on the open market and rely on third parties to provide certain finished goods. While these items are generally available from multiple sources, the cost of products sold may be affected by changes in the market price of raw materials and tariffs on certain raw materials, particularly imports from China, as well as disruptions in availability of raw materials, components and sourced finished goods. 
 We monitor and investigate alternative suppliers and materials based on numerous attributes including quality, service and price. We currently source raw materials and components from a number of suppliers, but our ongoing efforts to improve the cost effectiveness of our products and services may result in a reduction in the number of our suppliers. 
 Senior operating management supervises an extensive quality control program for our equipment, machinery and systems, and manufacturing processes. 
 Natural gas and other fuels are our primary energy sources. However, standby capacity for alternative sources is available if needed. 
 Though the COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted the global supply chain, we have not experienced significant supply disruption from third-party component suppliers. However, we have faced and continue to face some supply chain constraints primarily related to logistics, including higher freight rates, and obtaining select manufacturing components. In addition, shipments between countries have been impacted and we have experienced delays due to a variety of factors related to supply chain disruption. 
 
 Intellectual Property 
 We rely on a combination of intellectual property rights, including patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, and contractual provisions to protect our intellectual property. Our worldwide intellectual property portfolio is strengthened through innovation and brand recognition, and a comprehensive approach for protection and enforcement. We enter into confidentiality and intellectual property agreements with our employees that require them to disclose any inventions created in the scope of employment, convey all rights to those inventions to us, and restrict the distribution of proprietary information. Risk factors associated with our intellectual property are discussed in Item 1A, "Risk Factors". 
 We protect and promote our intellectual property portfolio and take those actions we deem appropriate to enforce our intellectual property rights and to defend our rights to sell our products both domestically and internationally. Although in the aggregate, our global portfolio of more than 2,100 granted and pending patents and more than 1,000 trademarks are valuable assets that are important to our operations, we believe that our competitive advantage is also largely attributable to the technical, marketing, and sales competence and capabilities of our employees, rather than on any individual patent or trademark. Therefore, we do not consider the expiration or loss of any single patent, trademark, or intellectual property right, to be material to our business as a whole. 
 
 Seasonal Variation in Business 
 Historically, the highest volume of sales occurs in the second half of the year due in large part to the timing of customers capital spending programs. Accordingly, first quarter sales volume is typically the lowest of the year due to timing of customers capital spending programs and customer holiday shutdowns. However, COVID-19, supply chain disruptions related to COVID-19 and other unusual events have impacted this historical trend to a degree. 
 
 Working Capital Practices 
 No special or unusual practices affect our working capital. We generally require advance payments as deposits on customized equipment and systems and, in certain cases, require progress payments during the manufacturing of these products. We continue to initiate new processes focused on reduction of manufacturing lead times, resulting in lower investment in inventory while maintaining the capability to respond promptly to customer needs. 
 
 Competitive Conditions 
 We operate in a competitive global marketplace and compete with many large, well-established and highly competitive manufacturers and service providers. Our business is affected by a range of macroeconomic conditions, including industry capacity changes, global competition and economic conditions in the U.S. and abroad, as well as fluctuations in currency exchange rates. Our equipment is sold in competition with a wide variety of alternative bonding, sealing, finishing, coating, processing, testing, inspecting and fluid control techniques. Potential uses for our equipment include any production processes 
 Nordson Corporation 7 

Table of Contents 

 that require preparation, modification or curing of surfaces; dispensing, application, processing or control of fluids and materials; or testing and inspecting for quality. 
 Many factors influence our competitive position, including pricing, product quality and service. We maintain a leadership position in our business segments by delivering high-quality, innovative products and technologies, as well as service and technical support. Working with customers to understand their processes and developing the application solutions that help them meet their production requirements also contributes to our leadership position. Our worldwide network of direct sales and technical resources also is a competitive advantage. 
 
 Compliance with Governmental Regulations 
 As a U.S. public company that supports manufacturing, designing and servicing highly complex products in regulated environments, our global operations are subject to a variety of laws, regulations and compliance obligations. We have robust internal controls, quality management systems, and management systems of compliance that govern our internal actions and mitigate our risk of non-compliance. We also have safeguards established to identify non-compliance concerns through internal and external audits and risk assessments, as well as an ethics helpline reporting system. 
 We are also required to comply with increasingly complex and changing laws and regulations enacted to protect business and personal data in the United States and other jurisdictions regarding privacy, data protection and data security, including those related to the collection, storage, use, transmission and protection of personal information and other consumer, customer, vendor or employee data. Such privacy and data protection laws and regulations, including with respect to the European Union s General Data Protection Regulation ("GDPR"), the Brazilian General Data Protection Law, and the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 ("CCPA"), and the interpretation and enforcement of such laws and regulations, are continuously developing and evolving and there is significant uncertainty with respect to how compliance with these laws and regulations may evolve and the costs and complexity of future compliance. 
 We are also subject to federal, state, local and foreign environmental, safety and health laws and regulations concerning, among other things, emissions to the air, discharges to land and water and the generation, handling, treatment and disposal of hazardous waste and other materials. Under certain of these laws, we can be held strictly liable for hazardous substance contamination of any real property we have ever owned, operated or used as a disposal site or for natural resource damages associated with such contamination. We are also required to maintain various related permits and licenses, many of which require periodic modification and renewal. The operation of manufacturing plants unavoidably entails environmental, safety and health risks, and we could incur material unanticipated costs or liabilities in the future if any of these risks were realized in ways or to an extent that we did not anticipate. 
 We believe that we operate in compliance, in all material respects, with applicable environmental laws and regulations. Compliance with environmental laws and regulations requires continuing management effort and expenditures. We have incurred, and will continue to incur, costs and capital expenditures to comply with these laws and regulations and to obtain and maintain the necessary permits and licenses. We believe that the cost of complying with environmental laws and regulations will not have a material effect on our earnings, liquidity or competitive position but cannot assure that material compliance-related costs and expenses may not arise in the future. For example, future adoption of new or amended environmental laws, regulations or requirements or newly discovered contamination or other circumstances could require us to incur costs and expenses that may have a material effect, but cannot be presently anticipated. 
 We believe that policies, practices and procedures have been properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of material environmental damage arising from our operations. We accrue for estimated environmental liabilities with charges to expense and believe our environmental accrual is adequate to provide for our portion of the costs of all such known environmental liabilities. Compliance with federal, state, local and foreign environmental protection laws during 2021 had no material effect on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position. Based upon consideration of currently available information, we believe liabilities for environmental matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, operating results or liquidity, but we cannot ensure that material environmental liabilities may not arise in the future. 
 For a discussion of the risks associated with these laws and regulations, see Part I, Item 1A, "Risk Factors." 
 
 Human Capital Resources

 Health and Safety 
 In 2021, our employees health and safety remained our highest priority, especially as we continued to operate through the ever-present COVID-19 pandemic. We manufacture products deemed essential to critical infrastructure industries, including health and safety, food and agriculture, and energy, and as a result, all of our production sites have continued to operate during the pandemic. Continuing the best practices that we adopted in 2020, we maintained a safe work environment for our employees by staying true to the recommendations of the World Health Organization, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and local governments, including taking actions such as: 
 Increasing hygiene, cleaning and sanitizing procedures at all locations; 
 Providing personal protective equipment, such as masks, available to employees; 
 Limiting travel and encouraged quarantine upon return; 
 Maintaining our COVID-leave policy encouraging employees to take time off for illness or caretaking while maintaining steady wages; 
 Enforcing strict protocols and screening for outside guests; and 
 Updating our coronavirus intranet site as a central resource for up-to-date and accurate information. 
 As the year progressed, different regions of the world experienced lower level of community spread. We began slowly reintegrating our employees, who had been working from home, into the office. As vaccines have become more available, we continue to actively encourage our global employees to be vaccinated as the best defense against the COVID-19 virus. We continue to be vigilant and adjust our guidelines based upon local data. Our focus on employee health and safety has allowed us to successfully meet the evolving needs of our customers during this unique and dynamic period. 
 Total Rewards 
 As part of our compensation philosophy, we believe that we must offer and maintain market competitive total rewards programs for our employees in order to attract and retain superior talent. These programs not only include base wages and incentives in support of our pay for performance culture, but also health, welfare, and retirement benefits. We focus many programs on employee wellness and have implemented solutions including mental health support access, telemedicine, and healthy weight loss programs. We believe that these solutions have helped us successfully manage healthcare and prescription drug costs for our employee population. 
 In the U.S., we match contributions to a tax-qualified defined contribution retirement savings plan (the Savings Plan for all eligible employees, in an amount equal to 50 cents for every dollar contributed by the employee until the employee contributions reach 6 of her or his base compensation. In addition, non-union new hires and re-hires as of July 1, 2021 are eligible for an additional enhanced 401(k) contribution of 3 eligible earnings. All contributions by employees into the Savings Plan are fully vested immediately. Company contributions, both the match and enhanced contribution, have a three-year graded vesting schedule and vest at 33 1/3 each year until fully vested after three years of employment. We also maintain a non-qualified, unfunded, and unsecured deferred compensation plan for the benefit of eligible management employees whose benefits under the Savings Plan are limited by the benefit restrictions of Section 415 of the Internal Revenue Code. In addition, non-union employees hired prior to July 1, 2021 are eligible to participate in a Company-sponsored tax-qualified pension plan for U.S.-based employees (the Salaried Pension Plan ). The Salaried Pension Plan is designed to work together with social security benefits to provide employees with up to 30 years of service retirement income replacement that is approximately 55 of eligible compensation, subject to the Internal Revenue Code maximum monthly benefit. Participants fully vest in the Salaried Pension Plan after five years of service. All eligible union employees hired prior to November 1, 2004 participate in a Company-sponsored tax-qualified pension plan for U.S.-based employees (the Hourly Pension Plan ). The Hourly Pension Plan provides a multiplier for each year of service to supplement employees retirement income. We also maintain a supplemental retirement benefit restoration plan Excess Defined Benefit Pension Plan ), which is an unfunded, non-qualified plan that is designed to provide retirement benefits to U.S.-based eligible participants hired prior to July 1, 2021, as a replacement for retirement benefits limited by regulations under the Internal Revenue Code. 
 Together, the Salaried Pension Plan and Excess Defined Benefit Pension Plan are intended to provide executive officers, hired prior to July 1, 2021, with retirement income at a level equivalent to that provided to other employees under the Salaried Pension Plan. 
 We also provide service awards which show appreciation and thanks to longstanding employees with five or more years of service. Service milestones are recognized at each five-year increment by presentation of a digital and/or printed certificate with an invitation to select a recognition award via an online catalog.

 Talent 
 Our key talent philosophy is to develop talent from within and supplement with external hires. This approach has yielded a deep understanding among our employee base of our business, products, and customers, while adding new employees and ideas in support of our continuous improvement mindset. We believe that our average tenure across the globe 10 years as of the end of 2021 reflects the strong engagement of our employees and is reflective of our positive workplace culture. Our talent acquisition team uses internal and external resources to recruit highly skilled and talented workers, and we encourage employee referrals for open positions. 
 Talent development and succession planning for critical roles is a cornerstone of our talent program. Development plans are created and monitored for critical roles to ensure progress is made along the established timelines. Development plans also intersect with our mission, particularly as we strive to be responsible to our communities. 
 One of our core values Respect for People reflects the behavior we strive to include in every aspect of the way we conduct business. Our inclusion and diversity initiatives support our goal that everyone throughout the Company is engaged in creating an inclusive workplace, and we work to build diverse talent pools as part of our recruitment efforts. We strive to promote inclusion through Inclusive Leadership and unconscious bias training across the Company. With the support of our board of directors, we continue to drive our diversity and inclusion initiatives.

 Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 In an enterprise as diverse as ours, a wide range of factors could affect future performance. We discuss in this section some of the risk factors that could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, value and results of operations. You should consider these risk factors in connection with evaluating the forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K because these factors could cause our actual results and financial condition to differ materially from those projected in forward-looking statements. Additional risks factors may exist that are not presently known by the Company or that are currently deemed immaterial may also be present. 
 Risks Related to the COVID-19 pandemic 
 The COVID-19 pandemic has negatively disrupted our ability to operate, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and capital investments, and may continue to have a negative impact, which could be material. 
 In March 2020, the World Health Organization categorized the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak as a pandemic, and the President of the United States declared the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak a national emergency. COVID-19 continues to spread in the United States and other countries across the world, and the ultimate duration and severity of its effects are currently unknown. Governments around the world have implemented various measures during this pandemic to help control the spread of the virus, including quarantines, social distancing protocols, shelter in place and stay at home orders, travel restrictions, business curtailments, school closures and other measures. In addition, governments and central banks in several parts of the world have utilized fiscal and monetary stimulus measures to attempt to counteract the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
 The COVID-19 pandemic has negatively disrupted, and may continue to negatively impact, our business. While we have continued to operate during the course of the COVID-19 pandemic in all of our production facilities and have supported multiple critical infrastructure sectors by manufacturing materials and products needed for medical supply chains, packaging, transportation, energy, communications, and other critical infrastructure industries, we have experienced unfavorable impacts on our manufacturing efficiencies due to the implementation of worker safety measures and cost increases from COVID-19 pandemic-related supply disruptions. We have invested and will continue to invest significant time and resources in modifying our business practices for the continued health and safety of our employees and in managing the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our global business. Our focus on managing and mitigating the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, including complying with any new or modified government health regulations, for an unknown period of time may cause us to divert or delay the application of our resources toward other or new initiatives or investments, which may have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations.

 Governments around the world have implemented fiscal stimulus measures to counteract the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. The magnitude and overall effectiveness of these actions remain uncertain. The full extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will impact our business going forward will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be accurately predicted, including, but not limited to, the duration and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic, variations of COVID-19, actions by government authorities to contain the outbreak or treat its impact, such as reimposing previously lifted measures or putting in place additional restrictions, the widespread distribution and acceptance of an effective vaccine, and the extent and severity of the impact on our customers, operations, and suppliers, all of which are uncertain and cannot be predicted. Our future results of operations and liquidity could be adversely impacted by delays in payments of outstanding receivable amounts beyond normal payment terms, supply chain disruptions and uncertain demand. 
 Additionally, to the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects our business, results of operations or financial condition, it may heighten other risks described in this Risk Factors section below. 
 
 Risks Related to Economic Conditions 
 Changes in United States or international economic conditions, including declines in the industries we serve, could adversely affect the profitability of any of our operations. 
 In 2021, approximately 33 percent of our revenue was generated in the United States, while approximately 67 percent was generated outside the United States. The COVID-19 pandemic and related preventative and mitigation measures implemented by governments around the world have to date negatively impacted the global economy and created significant volatility and disruption of financial markets. 
 A general sustained slowdown in the global economy or in a particular region or industry or an increase in trade tensions with U.S. trading partners could negatively impact our business, financial condition or liquidity. Our largest markets include consumer non-durable, industrial, medical, electronics, consumer durable and automotive. A slowdown in any of these specific end markets could directly affect our revenue stream and profitability. 
 A portion of our product sales is attributable to industries and markets, such as the electronics, polymer processing and metal finishing industries, which historically have been cyclical and sensitive to relative changes in supply and demand and general economic conditions. The demand for our products depends, in part, on the general economic conditions of the industries or national economies of our customers. Downward economic cycles in our customers industries or countries may reduce sales of some of our products. It is not possible to predict accurately the factors that will affect demand for our products in the future. 
 Any significant downturn in the health of the general economy, or any recession, depression or other sustained adverse market event resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, could have an adverse effect on our revenues and financial performance, resulting in impairment of assets. We cannot predict the strength or duration of any economic slowdown and instability or the timing of any recovery. 
 Our results have been and could continue to be impacted by uncertainty in U.S. trade policy, including uncertainty surrounding changes in tariffs, trade agreements or other trade restrictions imposed by the U.S. or other governments. 
 Our ability to conduct business can be significantly impacted by changes in tariffs, changes or repeals of trade agreements, including the impact of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement with Mexico and Canada, which replaced the North American Free Trade Agreement, or the imposition of other trade restrictions or retaliatory actions imposed by various governments. Other effects of these changes, including impacts on the price of raw materials, responsive actions from governments and the opportunity for competitors to establish a presence in markets where we participate, could also have significant impacts on our results. We cannot predict what further action may be taken with respect to tariffs or trade relations between the U.S. and other governments, and any further changes in U.S. or international trade policy could have an adverse impact on our business. Further, the level of impact from the COVID-19 pandemic and the reactions of governmental authorities and others thereto may have significant adverse effects on international trade policy. 
 Significant movements in foreign currency exchange rates or change in monetary policy may harm our financial results. 
 We are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly with respect to the euro, the yen, the pound sterling and the Chinese yuan. Any significant change in the value of the currencies of the countries in which we do business against the United States dollar could affect our ability to sell products competitively and control our cost structure, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. For additional detail related to this risk, see Part II, Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk. 
 A significant portion of our consolidated revenues in 2021 were generated in currencies other than the United States dollar, which is our reporting currency. We recognize foreign currency transaction gains and losses arising from our operations in the period incurred. As a result, currency fluctuations between the United States dollar and the currencies in which we do business 
 Nordson Corporation 11 

Table of Contents 

 have caused and will continue to cause foreign currency transaction and translation gains and losses, which historically have been material and could continue to be material. We cannot predict the effects of exchange rate fluctuations upon our future operating results because of the number of currencies involved, the variability of currency exposures and the potential volatility of currency exchange rates. We take actions to manage our foreign currency exposure, such as entering into hedging transactions, where available, but we cannot assure that our strategies will adequately protect our consolidated operating results from the effects of exchange rate fluctuations. For example, uncertainty surrounding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the effects of the departure of the United Kingdom from the European Union ("Brexit") have caused increased volatility in global currency exchange rates that have resulted in the strengthening of the United States dollar against the foreign currencies in which we conduct business. Future adverse consequences arising from the COVID-19 pandemic and Brexit may include continued volatility in exchange rates. Any significant fluctuation in exchange rates may be harmful to our financial condition and results of operations. We also face risks arising from the imposition of exchange controls and currency devaluations. Exchange controls may limit our ability to convert foreign currencies into United States dollars or to remit dividends and other payments by our foreign subsidiaries or customers located in or conducting business in a country imposing controls. Currency devaluations diminish the United States dollar value of the currency of the country instituting the devaluation and, if they occur or continue for significant periods, could adversely affect our earnings or cash flow. 
 Risks Related to Our Business and Operations 
 A disruption in, shortage of, or price increases for, supply of our components and raw materials may adversely impact our operations. 
 While we manufacture certain parts and components used in our products, we require substantial amounts of raw materials and purchase some parts and components from suppliers. The availability and prices for raw materials, parts and components may be subject to curtailment or change due to, among other things, suppliers' allocation to other purchasers, interruptions in production by suppliers, changes in exchange rates and prevailing price levels, including as a result of inflation. While we generally attempt to pass along higher raw material, part and component costs to our customers in the form of price increases, there historically has been a delay between an increase in our raw material costs and our ability to increase the prices of our products. Additionally, we may not be able to increase the prices of our products due to competitive pricing pressure and other factors. Shortages in raw materials or our inability to pass along price increases could affect the prices we charge, our operating costs and our competitive position, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 In addition, our facilities, supply chains, distribution systems, and products may be impacted by natural or man-made disruptions, including armed conflict, demand surges, damaging weather or other acts of nature, pandemics or other public health crises. A shutdown of, or inability to utilize, one or more of our facilities, our supply chain, or our distribution system could significantly disrupt our operations, delay production and shipments, impact our relationships and reputation with customers, suppliers, employees and others, result in lost sales, or result in legal exposure and large remediation or other expenses, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 Failure to retain our existing senior management team or the inability to attract and retain qualified personnel could hurt our business and inhibit our ability to operate and grow successfully. 
 The COVID-19 pandemic has created labor force disruptions impacting factory production and other operations. Our success will continue to depend to a significant extent on the continued service of our executive management team and the ability to recruit, hire and retain other key management personnel, including factory production workers and other staff, to support our growth and operational initiatives and replace those who retire or resign. Failure to retain our leadership team and workforce and to attract and retain other important management and technical personnel could place a constraint on our global growth and operational initiatives, possibly resulting in inefficient and ineffective management and operations, which would likely harm our revenues, operations and product development efforts and eventually result in a decrease in profitability. 
 The Company may be subject to risks relating to organizational changes. 
 We regularly execute organizational changes such as acquisitions, divestitures and realignments to support our growth and cost management strategies. We also engage in initiatives aimed to increase productivity, efficiencies and cash flow and to reduce costs. The Company commits significant resources to identify, develop and retain key employees to ensure uninterrupted leadership and direction. If we are unable to successfully manage these and other organizational changes, the ability to complete such activities and realize anticipated synergies or cost savings as well as our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. We cannot offer assurances that any of these initiatives will be beneficial to the extent anticipated, or that the estimated efficiency improvements, incremental cost savings or cash flow improvements will be realized as anticipated or at all.

 Political conditions in the U.S. and foreign countries in which we operate could adversely affect us. 
 We conduct our manufacturing, sales and distribution operations on a worldwide basis and are subject to risks associated with doing business both within and outside the United States. We expect that international operations and United States export sales will continue to be important to our business for the foreseeable future. Both sales from international operations and export sales are subject in varying degrees to risks inherent in doing business outside the United States. Such risks include, but are not limited to, the following: 
 risks of political or economic instability; 
 unanticipated or unfavorable circumstances arising from host country laws or regulations; 
 threats of war, terrorism or governmental instability; 
 changes in tax rates, adoption of new tax laws or other additional tax policies, and other proposals to reform United States and foreign tax laws that impact how United States multinational corporations are taxed on foreign earnings; 
 restrictions on the transfer of funds into or out of a country; 
 potential negative consequences from changes to taxation policies; 
 the disruption of operations from labor and political disturbances; 
 the imposition of tariffs, import or export licensing requirements and other potential changes in trade policies and relations arising from policy initiatives implemented by the U.S. presidential administration; 
 exchange controls or other trade restrictions including transfer pricing restrictions when products produced in one country are sold to an affiliated entity in another country; and 
 government responses to the COVID-19 pandemic. 
 Any of these events could reduce the demand for our products, limit the prices at which we can sell our products, interrupt our supply chain, or otherwise have an adverse effect on our operating performance. 
 Our international operations also depend upon favorable trade relations between the U.S. and those foreign countries in which our customers, subcontractors and materials suppliers have operations. A protectionist trade environment in either the U.S. or those foreign countries in which we do business, such as a change in the current tariff structures, export compliance or other trade policies, may materially and adversely affect our ability to sell our products in foreign markets. The current U.S. presidential administration has criticized existing trade agreements, and while it remains unclear what actions the current or future administration may take with respect to existing and proposed trade agreements, or restrictions on trade generally, more stringent export and import controls may be ultimately imposed in the future. 
 Increased information technology ("IT") security threats and more sophisticated and targeted cyber crime could pose a risk to our systems, networks, products, solutions and services. 
 We have experienced and expect to continue to experience cyber-attacks to our systems and networks. To date, we have not experienced any material breaches or material losses related to cyber-attacks. To conduct our business, we rely extensively on information technology systems, networks and services, some of which are managed, hosted and provided by third-party service providers. Increased global IT security threats and more sophisticated and targeted computer crime pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks and those of our third-party service providers and the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data. Depending on their nature and scope, such threats could potentially lead to the compromising of confidential information, including but not limited to confidential information relating to customer or employee data, improper use of our systems and networks, manipulation and destruction of data, defective products, production downtimes and operational disruptions, which in turn could adversely affect our reputation, competitiveness and results of operations. A cyber-attack or other disruption may also result in financial loss, including potential fines for failure to safeguard data or losses in connection with any litigation that may result from a cyber-attack. Our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all the costs arising from such events. 
 We have taken steps and incurred costs to further strengthen the security of our computer systems and continue to assess, maintain and enhance the ongoing effectiveness of our information security systems. While we attempt to mitigate these risks by employing a number of measures, including employee training, comprehensive monitoring of our networks and systems, and maintenance of backup and protective systems, our systems, networks, products, solutions and services remain potentially vulnerable to advanced persistent threats. The techniques used by criminals to obtain unauthorized access to sensitive data change frequently and often are not recognizable until launched against a target. Accordingly, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative measures. It is therefore possible that in the future we may suffer a 
 Nordson Corporation 13 

Table of Contents 

 criminal attack, unauthorized parties may gain access to personal information in our possession and we may not be able to identify any such incident in a timely manner. 
 The interpretation and application of data protection laws, including federal, state and international laws, relating to the collection, use, retention, disclosure, security and transfer of personally identifiable data in the U.S., Europe and elsewhere (including but not limited to the European Union s GDPR, the Brazilian General Data Protection Law and the CCPA, are uncertain and evolving. It is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our data practices. In addition, as a result of existing or new data protection requirements, we incur and expect to continue to incur significant ongoing operating costs as part of our significant efforts to protect and safeguard our sensitive data and personal information. These efforts also may divert management and employee attention from other business and growth initiatives. A breach in information privacy could result in legal or reputational risks and could have a negative impact on our revenues and results of operations. 
 If our intellectual property protection is inadequate, others may be able to use our technologies and tradenames and thereby reduce our ability to compete, which could have a material adverse effect on us, our financial condition and results of operations. 
 We regard much of the technology underlying our products and the trademarks under which we market our products as proprietary. The steps we take to protect our proprietary technology may be inadequate to prevent misappropriation of our technology, or third parties may independently develop similar technology. We rely on a combination of patents, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws, employee and third-party non-disclosure agreements and other contracts to establish and protect our technology and other intellectual property rights. The agreements may be breached or terminated, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach, and existing trade secrets, patent and copyright law afford us limited protection. Policing unauthorized use of our intellectual property is difficult. A third party could copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology without authorization. Litigation may be necessary for us to defend against claims of infringement or to protect our intellectual property rights and could result in substantial cost to us and diversion of our efforts. Further, we might not prevail in such litigation, which could harm our business. 
 Our products could infringe on the intellectual property of others, which may cause us to engage in costly litigation and, if we are not successful, could cause us to pay substantial damages and prohibit us from selling our products. 
 Third parties may assert infringement or other intellectual property claims against us based on their patents or other intellectual property claims, and we may have to pay substantial damages, possibly including treble damages, if it is ultimately determined our products infringe. We may have to obtain a license to sell our products if it is determined that our products infringe upon another party s intellectual property. We might be prohibited from selling our products before we obtain a license, which, if available at all, may require us to pay substantial royalties. Even if infringement claims against us are without merit, defending these types of lawsuits takes significant time, may be expensive and may divert management attention from other business concerns. 
 Risks Related to the Execution of Our Strategy 
 We continually assess the strategic fit of our existing businesses and may divest or otherwise dispose of businesses that are deemed not to fit with our strategic plan or are not achieving the desired return on investment, and we cannot be certain that our business, operating results and financial condition will not be materially and adversely affected. 
 A successful divestiture depends on various factors, including reaching an agreement with potential buyers on terms we deem attractive, as well as our ability to effectively transfer liabilities, contracts, facilities, and employees to any purchaser, identify and separate the intellectual property to be divested from the intellectual property that we wish to retain, reduce fixed costs previously associated with the divested assets or business, and collect the proceeds from any divestitures. These efforts require varying levels of management resources, which may divert our attention from other business operations. If we do not realize the expected benefits of any divestiture transaction, our consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows could be negatively impacted. In addition, divestitures of businesses involve a number of risks, including significant costs and expenses, the loss of customer relationships, and a decrease in revenues and earnings associated with the divested business. Furthermore, divestitures potentially involve significant post-closing separation activities, which could involve the expenditure of material financial resources and significant employee resources. Any divestiture may result in a dilutive impact to our future earnings if we are unable to offset the dilutive impact from the loss of revenue associated with the divestiture, as well as significant write-offs, including those related to goodwill and other intangible assets, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.

 If we fail to develop new products or enhance existing products, or our customers do not accept the new or enhanced products we develop, our revenue and profitability could be adversely impacted. 
 Innovation is critical to our success. We believe that we must continue to enhance our existing products and to develop and manufacture new products with improved capabilities in order to continue to be a leading provider of precision technology solutions. We also believe that we must continue to make improvements in our productivity in order to maintain our competitive position. Difficulties or delays in research, development or production of new or enhanced products or failure to gain market acceptance of new or enhanced products and technologies may reduce future sales and adversely affect our competitive position. We continue to invest in the development and marketing of new or enhanced products. There can be no assurance that we will have sufficient resources to make such investments, that we will be able to make the technological advances necessary to maintain competitive advantages or that we can recover major research and development expenses. If we fail to make innovations, launch products with quality problems or the market does not accept our new products, our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity could be adversely affected. In addition, as new or enhanced products are introduced, we must successfully manage the transition from older products to minimize disruption in customers ordering patterns, avoid excessive levels of older product inventories and ensure that we can deliver sufficient supplies of new products to meet customers demands. 
 Our growth strategy includes acquisitions, and we may not be able to execute on our acquisition strategy or integrate acquisitions successfully. 
 Our recent historical growth has depended, and our future growth is likely to continue to depend, in part on our acquisition strategy and the successful integration of acquired businesses into our existing operations. We intend to continue to seek additional acquisition opportunities both to expand into new markets and to enhance our position in existing markets throughout the world. We cannot assure we will be able to successfully identify suitable acquisition opportunities, prevail against competing potential acquirers, negotiate appropriate acquisition terms, obtain financing that may be needed to consummate such acquisitions, complete proposed acquisitions, successfully integrate acquired businesses into our existing operations or expand into new markets. In addition, we cannot assure that any acquisition, once successfully integrated, will perform as planned, be accretive to earnings, or prove to be beneficial to our operations and cash flow. 
 The success of our acquisition strategy is subject to other risks and uncertainties, including: 
 our ability to realize operating efficiencies, synergies or other benefits expected from an acquisition, and possible delays in realizing the benefits of the acquired company or products; 
 diversion of management s time and attention from other business concerns; 
 difficulties in retaining key employees, customers or suppliers of the acquired business; 
 difficulties in maintaining uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies throughout acquired companies; 
 adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers or customers; 
 the risks associated with the assumption of product liabilities or contingent or undisclosed liabilities of acquisition targets; and 
 the ability to generate future cash flows or the availability of financing. 
 In addition, an acquisition could adversely impact our operating performance as a result of the incurrence of acquisition-related debt, pre-acquisition potential tax liabilities, acquisition expenses, the amortization of acquisition-acquired assets, or possible future impairments of goodwill or intangible assets associated with the acquisition. 
 We may also face liability with respect to acquired businesses for violations of environmental laws occurring prior to the date of our acquisition, and some or all of these liabilities may not be covered by environmental insurance secured to mitigate the risk or by indemnification from the sellers from which we acquired these businesses. We could also incur significant costs, including, but not limited to, remediation costs, natural resources damages, civil or criminal fines and sanctions and third-party claims, as a result of past or future violations of, or liabilities, associated with environmental laws. 
 Any impairment in the value of our intangible assets, including goodwill, would negatively affect our operating results and total capitalization. 
 Our total assets reflect substantial intangible assets, primarily goodwill. The goodwill results from our acquisitions and represents the excess of cost over the fair value of the identifiable net assets we acquired. We assess at least annually whether there has been any impairment in the value of our intangible assets. If future operating performance at one or more of our business units were to fall significantly below current levels, if competing or alternative technologies emerge, if market conditions for acquired businesses decline, if significant and prolonged negative industry or economic trends exist, if our stock price and market capitalization declines, or if future cash flow estimates decline, we could incur, under current applicable 
 Nordson Corporation 15 

Table of Contents 

 accounting rules, a non-cash charge to operating earnings for goodwill impairment. Any determination requiring the write-off of a significant portion of unamortized intangible assets would negatively affect our results of operations and equity book value, the effect of which could be material. 
 Risks Related to Legal, Compliance and Regulatory Matters 
 Changes in United States and international tax law may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 We are subject to income taxes in the United States and various foreign jurisdictions. Changes in applicable domestic or foreign tax laws and regulations, or their interpretation and application, including the possibility of retroactive effect, could affect our business, financial condition and profitability by increasing our tax liabilities. Our future results of operations could be adversely affected by changes in our effective tax rate as a result of a change in the mix of earnings in jurisdictions with differing statutory tax rates, changes in our overall profitability, changes in tax legislation and rates, changes in generally accepted accounting principles and changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities. The U.S. federal government may adopt changes to international trade agreements, tariffs, taxes and other government rules and regulations. While we cannot predict what changes will actually occur with respect to any of these items, such changes could affect our business and results of operations. 
 We may be exposed to liabilities under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), which could have a material adverse effect on our business. 
 We are subject to compliance with various laws and regulations, including the FCPA, UK Bribery Act and similar worldwide anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws, which generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from engaging in bribery or making other improper payments to private or public parties for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or gaining an unfair business advantage. The FCPA also requires proper record keeping and characterization of such payments in our reports filed with the SEC. Our employees are trained and required to comply with these laws, and we are committed to legal compliance and corporate ethics. Violations of these laws could result in severe criminal or civil sanctions and financial penalties and other consequences that may have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial condition or results of operations. 
 The level of returns on pension plan assets, changes in the actuarial assumptions used, and management of pension liabilities could adversely affect us. 
 Our operating results may be positively or negatively impacted by the amount of expense we record for our defined benefit pension plans. U.S. GAAP requires that we calculate pension expense using actuarial valuations, which are dependent upon our various assumptions including estimates of expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, discount rates for future payment obligations, and the expected rate of increase in future compensation levels. Our pension expense and funding requirements may also be affected by our actual return on plan assets and by legislation and other government regulatory actions. Changes in assumptions, laws or regulations, and how the Company manages pension liabilities could lead to variability in financial results and could have a material adverse impact on liquidity. 
 Our global operations are subject to increasingly complex environmental regulatory requirements. 
 We are subject to increasingly complex environmental regulations affecting international manufacturers, including those related to air and water emissions, waste management and climate change. Some environmental laws impose strict, retroactive and joint and several liability for the remediation of the release of hazardous substances, even for conduct that was lawful at the time it occurred, or for the conduct of or conditions caused by prior operators, predecessors or third parties. Failure to comply with environmental laws could expose us to penalties or clean-up costs, civil or criminal liability and sanctions on certain of our activities, as well as damage to property or natural resources. These liabilities, sanctions, damages and remediation efforts related to any non-compliance with such laws and regulations could negatively impact our ability to conduct our operations and our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, there can be no assurances that we will not be adversely affected by costs, liabilities or claims with respect to existing or subsequently acquired operations or under present laws and regulations or those that may be adopted or imposed in the future. 
 Changes in environmental laws or regulations could result in higher expenses and payments, and uncertainty relating to environmental laws or regulations may also affect how we conduct our operations and structure our investments and could limit our ability to enforce our rights. Changes in environmental and climate change laws or regulations, including laws relating to greenhouse gas emissions, could subject us to additional costs and restrictions, including increased energy and raw material costs. If environmental laws or regulations are either changed or adopted and impose significant operational restrictions and compliance requirements upon us or our products, they could negatively impact our business, capital expenditures, results of operations, financial condition and competitive position.

 It is our policy to apply strict standards for environmental protection to all of our operations inside and outside of the United States, even when we are not subject to local government regulations. We may incur substantial costs, including cleanup costs, fines and civil or criminal sanctions, liabilities resulting from third-party property damage or personal injury claims, or our products could be prohibited from entering certain jurisdictions, if we were to violate or become liable under environmental laws, if our products become non-compliant with environmental laws or if we were to undertake environmental protection actions voluntarily. 
 Risks Related to Our Capital Structure 
 Our inability to comply with our existing credit facilities restrictive covenants or to access additional sources of capital could impede growth or the repayment or refinancing of existing indebtedness. 
 The limits imposed on us by the restrictive covenants contained in our credit facilities could prevent us from making acquisitions or cause us to lose access to these facilities. 
 Our existing credit facilities contain restrictive covenants that limit our ability to, among other things: 
 borrow money or guarantee the debts of others; 
 use assets as security in other transactions; 
 make restricted payments or distributions; and 
 sell or acquire assets or merge with or into other companies. 
 In addition, our credit facilities require us to meet financial ratios, including a Leverage Ratio and an Interest Coverage Ratio, both as defined in the credit facilities. 
 These restrictions could limit our ability to plan for or react to market conditions or meet extraordinary capital needs and could otherwise restrict our financing activities. 
 Our ability to comply with the covenants and other terms of our credit facilities will depend on our future operating performance. If we fail to comply with such covenants and terms, we may be in default and the maturity of the related debt could be accelerated and become immediately due and payable. We may be required to obtain waivers from our lenders in order to maintain compliance under our credit facilities, including waivers with respect to our compliance with certain financial covenants. If we are unable to obtain necessary waivers and the debt under our credit facilities is accelerated, we would be required to obtain replacement financing at prevailing market rates. 
 We may need new or additional financing in the future to expand our business or refinance existing indebtedness. If we are unable to access capital on satisfactory terms and conditions, we may not be able to expand our business or meet our payment requirements under our existing credit facilities. Our ability to obtain new or additional financing will depend on a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control. We may not be able to obtain new or additional financing because we have substantial debt or because we may not have sufficient cash flow to service or repay our existing or future debt. In addition, depending on market conditions and our financial performance, neither debt nor equity financing may be available on satisfactory terms or at all. Finally, as a consequence of worsening financial market conditions, our credit facility providers may not provide the agreed credit if they become undercapitalized. 
 Changes in interest rates could adversely affect us. 
 Any period of interest rate increases may adversely affect our profitability. At October 31, 2021, we had 815,897 of total debt and notes payable outstanding, of which 38 percent was priced at interest rates that float with the market. A one percentage point increase in the interest rate on the floating rate debt in 2020 would have resulted in approximately 3,982 of additional interest expense. A higher level of floating rate debt would increase the exposure to changes in interest rates. For additional detail related to this risk, see Part II, Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. Additionally, the interest rates on some of our debt is tied to LIBOR. In July 2017, the head of the United Kingdom s Financial Conduct Authority announced its intention to phase out the use of LIBOR by June 2023. The uncertainty regarding the transition from LIBOR to another benchmark rate or rates could have adverse impacts on our available debt that currently uses LIBOR as a benchmark rate, and ultimately, adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.

 General Risk Factors 
 The insurance that we maintain may not fully cover all potential exposures. 
 We maintain property, business interruption and casualty insurance but such insurance may not cover all risks associated with the hazards of our business and is subject to limitations, including deductibles and maximum liabilities covered. We are potentially at risk if one or more of our insurance carriers fail. Additionally, severe disruptions in the domestic and global financial markets could adversely impact the ratings and survival of some insurers. In the future, we may not be able to obtain coverage at current levels, and our premiums may increase significantly on coverage that we maintain. 
 Our business and operating results may be adversely affected by natural disasters or other catastrophic events beyond our control. 
 While we have taken precautions to prevent production and service interruptions at our global facilities, severe weather conditions, including any that may be caused by global climate change, such as hurricanes or tornadoes, as well as major earthquakes, wildfires and other natural disasters, as well as cyberterrorism, in areas in which we have manufacturing facilities or from which we obtain products may cause physical damage to our properties, closure of one or more of our manufacturing or distribution facilities, lack of an adequate work force in a market, temporary disruption in the supply of inventory, disruption in the transport of products and utilities, and delays in the delivery of products to our customers. Any of these factors may disrupt our operations and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.

 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 Our Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate the accounting policies and estimates that are used to prepare financial statements. We base our estimates on historical experience and assumptions believed to be reasonable under current facts and circumstances. Actual amounts and results could differ from these estimates used by management. 
 Certain accounting policies that require significant management estimates and are deemed critical to our results of operations or financial position are discussed below. On a regular basis, critical accounting policies are reviewed with the Audit Committee of the board of directors. 
 Revenue recognition - A contract exists when it has approval and commitment from both parties, the rights of the parties are identified, payment terms are identified, the contract has commercial substance and collectability of the consideration is probable. Revenue is recognized when performance obligations under the terms of the contract with a customer are satisfied. Generally, our revenue results from short-term, fixed-price contracts and is recognized as of a point in time when the product is shipped or at a later point when the control of the product transfers to the customer. Refer to Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion regarding the Company's revenue recognition policy. 
 Business combinations - The acquisitions of our businesses are accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting. The amounts assigned to the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with acquisitions are based on estimated fair values as of the date of the acquisition, with the remainder, if any, recorded as goodwill. The fair values are determined by management, taking into consideration information supplied by the management of the acquired entities, and other relevant information. Such information typically includes valuations obtained from independent appraisal experts, which management reviews and considers in its estimates of fair values. The valuations are generally based upon future cash flow projections for the acquired assets, discounted to present value. The determination of fair values requires significant judgment by management, particularly with respect to the value of identifiable intangible assets. This judgment could result in either a higher or lower value assigned to amortizable or depreciable assets. The impact could result in either higher or lower amortization and/or depreciation expense. 
 Goodwill - Goodwill is the excess of purchase price over the fair value of tangible and identifiable intangible net assets acquired in various business combinations. Goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment annually at the reporting unit level, or more often if indications of impairment exist. Our reporting units are one level below the Industrial Precision Solutions segment, and one level below the Advanced Technology Solutions segment. 
 We test goodwill in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 350. We did not record any goodwill impairment charges in 2021. We use an independent valuation specialist to assist with refining our assumptions and methods used to determine fair values. To test for goodwill impairment, we estimate the fair value of each of our reporting units using a combination of the Income Approach and the Market Approach. 
 The discounted cash flow method (Income Approach) uses assumptions for revenue growth, operating margin, and working capital turnover that are based on management s strategic plans tempered by performance trends and reasonable expectations about those trends. Terminal value calculations employ a published formula known as the Gordon Growth Model Method that essentially captures the present value of perpetual cash flows beyond the last projected period assuming a constant Weighted Average Cost of Capital ("WACC") methodology and growth rate. For each reporting unit, a sensitivity analysis is performed to vary the discount and terminal growth rates in order to provide a range of reasonableness for detecting impairment. Discount rates are developed using a WACC methodology. 
 Nordson Corporation 24 

Table of Contents 

 The WACC represents the blended average required rate of return for equity and debt capital based on observed market return data and company specific risk factors. For 2021, the WACC rates used ranged from 7.5 percent to 10.0 percent depending upon the reporting unit's size, end market volatility, and projection risk. See Note 6 - Goodwill and intangible assets for further details regarding the valuation methodologies used. 
 In 2021, 2020, and 2019, the results of our annual impairment tests indicated no impairment. 
 The fair value ("FV") was compared to the carrying value ("CV") for each reporting unit. Based on the results shown in the table below and based on our measurement date of August 1, 2021, our conclusion is that no goodwill was impaired in 2021. Potential events or circumstances, such as a sustained downturn in global economies, could have a negative effect on estimated fair values.

 Pension plan in the United States - The measurement of the liabilities related to our domestic pension plan is based on management s assumptions related to future factors, including interest rates, return on pension plan assets, compensation increases, mortality and turnover assumptions, and health care cost trend rates. The liabilities associated with the Company's international pension plans and OPEB are not as materially sensitive to changes in assumptions as the pension plan in the United States. 
 The weighted-average discount rate used to determine the present value of our domestic pension plan obligations was 3.02 percent at October 31, 2021 and 2.85 percent at October 31, 2020. The discount rate used was determined by using quality fixed income investments with a duration period approximately equal to the period over which pension obligations are expected to be settled. 
 In determining the expected return on plan assets, we consider both historical performance and an estimate of future long-term rates of return on assets similar to those in our plans. We consult with and consider the opinions of financial and actuarial experts in developing appropriate return assumptions. The expected rate of return (long-term investment rate) on domestic pension assets used to determine net benefit costs was 5.75 percent in both 2021 and 2020. 
 The assumed rate of compensation increases used to determine the present value of our domestic pension plan obligations was 4.00 percent at both October 31, 2021 and October 31, 2020. 
 Annual expense amounts are determined based on the discount rate used at the end of the prior year. Differences between actual and assumed investment returns on pension plan assets result in actuarial gains or losses that are amortized into expense over a period of years. 
 Economic assumptions have a significant effect on the amounts reported. The effect of a one percent change in the discount rate, expected return on assets and compensation increase is shown in the table below. Bracketed numbers represent decreases in expense and obligation amounts.

 Income taxes Income taxes are estimated based on income for financial reporting purposes. Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes and certain changes in valuation allowances. We provide valuation allowances against deferred tax assets if, based on available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. 
 Management believes the valuation allowances are adequate after considering future taxable income, allowable carryforward periods and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. In the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize the deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount (including the valuation allowance), an adjustment to the valuation allowance would increase income in the period such determination was made. Conversely, should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of the net deferred tax asset in the future, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be expensed in the period such determination was made. 
 Further, at each interim reporting period, we estimate an effective income tax rate that is expected to be applicable for the full year. Significant judgment is involved regarding the application of global income tax laws and regulations and when projecting the jurisdictional mix of income. Additionally, interpretation of tax laws, court decisions or other guidance provided by taxing authorities influences our estimate of the effective income tax rates. As a result, our actual effective income tax rates and related income tax liabilities may differ materially from our estimated effective tax rates and related income tax liabilities. Any resulting differences are recorded in the period they become known. 
 
 2021 compared to 2020 
 Below is a detailed discussion comparison of our results of operations for the fiscal years ended October 31, 2021 and October 31, 2020. For a discussion of changes from the fiscal year ended October 31, 2020 to the fiscal year ended October 31, 2019, refer to Part II, Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2020. 
 As used throughout this annual report, geographic regions include the Americas (Canada, Mexico and Central and South America), Asia Pacific (excluding Japan), Europe, Japan, and the United States. 
 Worldwide sales for 2021 were 2,362,209, an increase of 11.4 percent from 2020 sales of 2,121,100. The increase consisted of a 11.3 percent improvement in sales volume and favorable currency translation effects, which increased sales by 2.7 percent partially offset by a net 2.6 percent decrease from acquisitions and divestitures. 
 Sales outside the United States accounted for 66.6 percent of total sales in 2021, as compared to 64.4 percent in 2020. On a geographic basis, sales in the United States were 789,303, an increase of 4.5 percent from 2020. The increase in sales consisted of a 8.3 percent increase in sales volume partially offset by a 3.8 percent decrease from acquisitions and divestitures. Sales in the Asia Pacific region were 668,035, an increase of 19.1 percent from 2020, with volume increasing 16.7 percent and favorable currency effects of 4.2 percent. partially offset by a 1.8 percent decrease from acquisitions and divestitures. Sales in Europe were 617,492, an increase of 15.1 percent from 2020. The increase in sales consisted of a 11.4 percent volume increase and favorable currency effects of 5.7 percent partially offset by a 2.0 percent decrease from acquisitions and divestitures. In the Americas region, sales were 179,807, an increase of 27.1 percent from 2020, with volume increasing 24.4 percent, favorable currency effects of 1.8 percent and a 0.9 percent increase from acquisitions and divestitures. Sales in Japan were 107,572, a decrease of 15.0 percent from 2020, with volume decreasing 11.0 percent, unfavorable currency effects of 0.5 percent and a 3.5 percent decrease from acquisitions and divestitures. 
 Cost of sales were 1,038,129 in 2021, up 4.8 percent from 990,632 in 2020. Gross profit, expressed as a percentage of sales, increased to 56.1 percent in 2021 from 53.3 percent in 2020. The 2.8 percentage point increase in gross margin was driven by a favorable product mix impact, principally driven by a divestiture, of 1.9 percentage points and favorable sales volume leverage. 
 Selling and administrative expenses were 708,953 in 2021, up from 693,552 in 2020. The 2.2 percent increase was driven by base business growth of 2.6 percentage points due primarily to increased variable incentive compensation, partially offset by reductions resulting from structural cost reduction actions taken in 2020. In addition, unfavorable currency translation effects increased costs by 2.1 percentage points. These increases were offset by a divestiture impact of 2.5 percentage points. Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales decreased to 30.0 percent in 2021 from 32.7 percent in 2020. Of the 2.7 percentage point decrease, a divestiture decreased expenses by 1.2 percentage points, while sales growth leverage contributed to the remaining percentage point improvement. 
 Operating profit as a percentage of sales increased to 26.0 percent in 2021 compared to 16.5 percent in 2020. The 9.5 percent increase in operating margin was the result of improved operating results, specifically favorable absorption from higher sales volume and favorable product mix driven by a divestiture, and 2020 operating profit was negatively impacted by an assets held for sale impairment charge related to the 2021 product line divestiture.

 Operating capacity for each of our segments can support fluctuations in order activity without significant changes in operating costs. Operating margins for each segment were favorably impacted by a weaker dollar primarily against the Euro, Chinese Yuan, and Mexican Peso during 2021 as compared to 2020. 
 Interest expense in 2021 was 25,491, a decrease of 6,669, or 20.7 percent, from 2020 . The decrease was due to lower average debt levels compared to the prior year. Other expense in 2021 was 17,610 compared to other expense of 17,577 in 2020 . Included in 2021 s other expense were pension costs of 9,484 and 5,926 in foreign currency losses. Included in the prior year s other expense were pension costs of 13,683 and 1,532 in foreign currency losses. The decrease in pension cost was principally attributable to decreased amortization of net actuarial losses. 
 Income tax expense in 2021 was 119,808, or 20.9 percent of pre-tax income, as compared to 51,950, or 17.2 percent of pre-tax income in 2020 . The income tax provision for 2021 included a tax benefit of 5,982 due to our share-based payment transactions. Our income tax provision for 2020 included a tax benefit of 15,661 due to our share-based payment transactions. Net income in 2020 included a non-cash, assets held for sale impairment charge of 87,371 related to our commitment to sell our screws and barrels product line within the Adhesives reporting unit under our Industrial Precision Solutions segment and the tax benefit of the impairment was 15,254. A portion of the impairment charge did not have related tax benefits. 
 Net income was 454,368, or 7.74 per diluted share, in 2021, compared to net income of 249,539, or 4.27 per diluted share, in 2020. This represented a 82.1 percent increase in net income and a 81.3 percent increase in diluted earnings per share. Net income in 2020 included a non-cash, assets held for sale impairment charge net of tax 72,117 related to the sale of the screws and barrels product line within the Adhesives reporting unit under our Industrial Precision Solutions segment. The remaining increase of 2.24 per diluted share was primarily driven by sales growth and mix improvement. 
 Industrial Precision Solutions 
 Sales of the Industrial Precision Solutions segment were 1,246,947 in 2021, an increase of 9.1 percent, from 2020 sales of 1,143,423. The increase was the result of an organic sales volume increase of 11.7 percent and favorable currency effects that increased sales by 3.4 percent, partially offset by a divestiture impact of 6.0 percent. Growth occurred in all product lines, except nonwovens, and in all regions except for Japan. 
 Operating profit as a percentage of sales increased to 33.2 percent in 2021 compared to 18.2 percent in 2020. The 15.0 percentage point improvement in operating margin was the result of improved operating results, specifically favorable absorption from higher sales volume and favorable product mix driven by a divestiture, and 2020 operating profit negatively impacted by an assets held for sale impairment charge related to a divestiture. 
 Advanced Technology Solutions 
 Sales of the Advanced Technology Solutions segment were 1,115,262 in 2021, an increase of 14.1 percent from 2020 sales of 977,677. The increase was the result of an organic sales volume increase of 10.9 percent, favorable currency effects that increased sales by 1.9 percent and a 1.3 percent increase from acquisitions. Sales growth was strong across all product lines and in all regions. 
 Operating profit as a percentage of sales increased to 24.4 percent in 2021 compared to 19.6 percent in 2020. The 4.8 percentage point improvement in operating margin was principally driven by greater selling and administrative expense leverage which contributed 3.1 percentage points and was associated with the sales volume growth and cost structure simplification actions taken in 2020. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Cash and cash equivalents increased 91,679 in 2021 to 299,972 as of October 31, 2021 compared to 208,293 as of October 31, 2020. Approximately 55 percent of our consolidated cash and cash equivalents were held at various foreign subsidiaries as of October 31, 2021. On November 1, 2021, cash of 180,000 was used to fund the acquisition of NDC Technologies ("NDC") as disclosed in Note 19 to these Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 Cash provided by operating activities was 545,927 in 2021, compared to 502,421 in 2020. The primary sources were net income adjusted for non-cash income and expenses (consisting of depreciation and amortization, non-cash stock compensation, provision for losses on receivables, deferred income taxes, other non-cash expense, loss on sale of property, plant and equipment, and impairment loss on assets held for sale), which was 590,607 in 2021, compared to 455,490 in 2020. Changes in working capital items provided cash of 29,011 compared to 45,113 provided in 2020 as increases in receivables and inventory were partially offset by increases in other liabilities. In addition, pension cash contributions increased by 53,975 in 2021 compared to 2020 which are included in "Other - principally pension plan" in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. 
 Cash used in investing activities was 33,169 in 2021, compared to 194,109 in 2020. In the current year, no cash was used for acquisitions compared to 142,414 used in the prior year. Capital expenditures were 38,303 in 2021 compared to 50,535 in 2020.

 Cash used in financing activities was 422,913 in 2021, compared to 251,529 cash used in 2020. Net repayment of long-term debt and long-term borrowings used 289,416 of cash in 2021, compared to 153,816 used in 2020. In 2021, cash of 60,970 was used for the purchase of treasury shares, up from 52,614 used in 2020. Dividend payments were 97,683 in 2021, up from 88,347 in 2020 due to an increase in the annual dividend to 1.69 per share from 1.53 per share. Issuance of common shares related to employee benefit plans generated 31,780 of cash in 2021, down from 50,853 in 2020. 
 The following is a summary of significant changes by balance sheet caption from October 31, 2020 to October 31, 2021. Inventories-net increased 50,162 due to increased business activity during the year. Intangible assets-net decreased 50,219 due to amortization expense and the divestiture of our screws and barrels product line. Pension obligations decreased 84,945 primarily due to pension contributions during the second and third quarters of 2021. 
 Our operating performance, balance sheet position, and financial ratios for 2021 remained strong. Long-term debt decreased 286,243 during 2021 primarily due to the full repayment of our term loan due 2024. The Company is well-positioned to manage liquidity needs that arise from working capital requirements, capital expenditures, and contributions related to pension and postretirement obligations as well as principal and interest payments on our outstanding debt. Primary sources of capital to meet these needs, as well as other opportunistic investments, are a combination of cash provided by operations and borrowings under our loan agreements. Cash from operations, which when combined with our available borrowing capacity and ready access to capital markets, is expected to be more than adequate to fund our liquidity needs over the next year.

 (3) Pension and postretirement plan funding amounts will be determined based on the future funded status of the plans and therefore cannot be estimated at this time. Refer to Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 
 (4) Purchase obligations primarily represent commitments for materials used in our manufacturing processes that are not recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheet. 
 We believe that the combination of present capital resources, cash from operations and unused financing sources such as our credit facilities are more than adequate to meet cash requirements for 2021 and beyond. There are no significant restrictions limiting the transfer of funds from international subsidiaries to the parent company. 
 
 Outlook 
 We are optimistic about our long-term growth opportunities in the diverse end markets we serve. We also support our customers with parts and consumables, so a significant percentage of our revenue is recurring. The combination of the Company's core strength in the direct-sales model and product innovation, combined with the Ascend Strategy, should deliver sustainable profitable growth. We expect to deliver increased sales and earnings in 2022 compared to 2021.

 Effects of Foreign Currency 
 The impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on sales and operating results cannot be precisely measured due to fluctuating selling prices, sales volume, product mix and cost structures in each country where we operate. As a general rule, a weakening of the United States dollar relative to foreign currencies has a favorable effect on sales and net income, while a strengthening of the dollar has a detrimental effect. 
 In 2021, as compared with 2020, the United States dollar was generally weaker against foreign currencies. If 2020 exchange rates had been in effect during 2021, sales would have been approximately 55,200 lower and third -party costs would have been approximately 24,600 lower. In 2020, as compared with 2019, the United States dollar was generally stronger against foreign currencies. If 2019 exchange rates had been in effect during 2020, sales would have been approximately 5,400 higher and third-party costs would have been approximately 1,200 higher. These effects on reported sales do not include the impact of local price adjustments made in response to changes in currency exchange rates. 
 
 Trends 
 Our solid historical performance is attributed to our diverse geographic and end market participation and our long-term commitment to develop and provide quality products and worldwide service to meet our customers changing needs.

 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 We operate internationally and enter into intercompany transactions denominated in foreign currencies. Consequently, we are subject to market risk arising from exchange rate movements between the dates foreign currencies are recorded and the dates they are settled. We regularly use foreign exchange contracts to reduce our risks related to most of these transactions. These contracts, primarily associated with the euro, yen and pound sterling, typically have maturities of 90 days or less, and generally require the exchange of foreign currencies for United States dollars at rates stated in the contracts. Gains and losses from changes in the market value of these contracts offset foreign exchange losses and gains, respectively, on the underlying transactions. Other transactions denominated in foreign currencies are designated as hedges of our net investments in foreign subsidiaries or are intercompany transactions of a long-term investment nature. We use foreign exchange contracts on a routine basis to help mitigate the risks related to transactions denominated in foreign currencies. 
 Refer to Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion about our foreign currency transactions and the methods and assumptions used to record these transactions. 
 A portion of our operations is financed with short-term and long-term borrowings and is subject to market risk arising from changes in interest rates.

 We also have variable-rate notes payable and long-term debt. The weighted average interest rate of this variable-rate debt was 0.71 percent at October 31, 2021 and 0.76 percent at October 31, 2020. A one percent increase in interest rates would have resulted in additional interest expense of approximately 3,982 on the variable rate notes payable and long-term debt in 2021.

NOTE REGARDING AMOUNTS AND FISCAL YEAR REFERENCES 
 In this annual report, all amounts related to United States dollars and foreign currency and to the number of Nordson Corporation s common shares, except for per share earnings and dividend amounts, are expressed in thousands. Unless the context otherwise indicates, all references to we or the Company mean Nordson Corporation.

percent of our overall consolidated revenues at October 31, 2021 or 2020. 
 Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration we expect to receive in exchange for transferring products or services. Taxes, including sales and value add, that we collect concurrently with revenue-producing activities are excluded from revenue. As a practical expedient, we may exclude the assessment of whether goods or services are performance obligations, if they are immaterial in the context of the contract, and combine these with other performance obligations. While payment terms and conditions vary by contract type, we have determined that our contracts generally do not include a significant financing component. We have elected to apply the practical expedient to treat all shipping and handling costs as fulfillment costs as a significant portion of these costs are incurred prior to transfer of control to the customer. We have also elected to apply the practical expedient to expense sales commissions as they are incurred as the amortization period resulting from capitalizing the costs is one year or less. These costs are recorded within Selling, general and administrative expenses in our Consolidated Statements of Income. 
 We offer assurance type warranties on our products as well as separately sold warranty contracts. Revenue related to warranty contracts that are sold separately is recognized over the life of the warranty term and are not material. Certain arrangements may include installation, installation supervision, training, and spare parts, which tend to be completed in a short period of time, at an insignificant cost, and utilizing skills not unique to us, therefore, are typically regarded as inconsequential or not material.

 percent point change in assumed health care cost trend rates on the (a) aggregate of the service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit costs and (b) benefit obligations for postretirement health care benefits are removed. A disclosure requirement was added for the explanation of the reasons for significant gains and losses related to changes in the benefit obligation for the period. Additionally, the standard clarifies disclosure requirements surrounding the projected benefit obligation (PBO) and fair value of plan assets for plans with PBOs in excess of plan assets and the accumulated benefit obligation (ABO) and fair value of plan assets for plans with ABOs in excess of plan assets. We adopted the new standard and revised disclosures as reflected in Note 7 with no material impact to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 In August 2018, the FASB issued a new standard which removes, modifies, and adds certain disclosure requirements on fair value measurements. The guidance removes disclosure requirements pertaining to the amount of and reasons for transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, the policy for timing of transfers between levels, and the valuation processes for Level 3 fair value measurements. For investments in certain entities that calculate net asset value, an entity is required to disclose the timing of liquidation of an investee s assets and the date when restrictions from redemption might lapse only if the investee has communicated the timing to the entity or announced the timing publicly. In addition, the amendment clarifies that the measurement uncertainty disclosure is to communicate information about the uncertainty in measurement as of the reporting date. The guidance adds disclosure requirements for changes in unrealized gains and losses for the period included in other comprehensive income for recurring Level 3 fair value measurements held at the end of the reporting period as well as

 Pension plans We have various pension plans covering a portion of our United States and international employees. Pension plan benefits are generally based on years of employment and, for salaried employees, the level of compensation. Actuarially determined amounts are contributed to United States plans to provide sufficient assets to meet future benefit payment requirements. We also sponsor an unfunded supplemental pension plan for certain employees. International subsidiaries fund their pension plans according to local requirements.

Rate of compensation increase Assumptions used to determine net benefit costs for the years ended October 31: Discount rate - benefit obligation Discount rate - service cost Discount rate - interest cost Expected return on plan assets Rate of compensation increase 
 The amortization of prior service cost is determined using a straight-line amortization of the cost over the average remaining service period of employees expected to receive benefits under the plans. 
 The discount rate reflects the current rate at which pension liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year. The discount rate used considers a yield derived from matching projected pension payments with maturities of a portfolio of available bonds that receive the highest rating given from a recognized investments ratings agency. The changes in the discount rates in 2021, 2020, and 2019 are due to changes in yields for these types of investments as a result of the economic environment. 
 In determining the expected return on plan assets using the calculated value of plan assets, we consider both historical performance and an estimate of future long-term rates of return on assets similar to those in our plans. We consult with and consider the opinions of financial and other professionals in developing appropriate return assumptions. The rate of compensation increase is based on management s estimates using historical experience and expected increases in rates. 
 The international plans include a cash balance plan with promised interest crediting rates. The weighted average crediting rates were , and for 2021, 2020 and 2019. 
 Gains or losses within the corridor remain in other comprehensive income and are retested in subsequent measurements. Gains or losses outside of the corridor are subject to amortization over an average employee future service period that differs by plan. If substantially all of the plan s participants are no longer actively accruing benefits, the average life expectancy is used.

percent of the Company's worldwide pension assets. In general, the investment strategies focus on asset class diversification, liquidity to meet benefit payments and an appropriate balance of long-term investment return and risk. Target ranges for asset allocations are determined by dynamically matching the actuarial projections of the plans future liabilities and benefit payments with expected long-term rates of return on the assets, taking into account investment return volatility and correlations across asset classes. For 2021, the target in return-seeking assets is percent and percent in longer duration fixed income assets. Plan assets are diversified across multiple investment managers and are invested in liquid funds that are selected to track broad market indices. Investment risk is carefully controlled with plan assets rebalanced to target allocations on a periodic basis and continual monitoring of investment managers performance relative to the guidelines established with each investment manager. 
 Our international plans comprise percent of the Company's worldwide pension assets. Asset allocations are developed on a country-specific basis. Our investment strategy is to cover pension obligations with insurance contracts or to employ independent managers to invest the assets.

 These investment funds did not own a significant number of shares of Nordson Corporation common stock for any year presented. 
 The inputs and methodology used to measure fair value of plan assets are consistent with those described in Note 12. Following are the valuation methodologies used to measure these assets: 
 Money market funds - Money market funds are public investment vehicles that are valued with a net asset value of one dollar. This is a quoted price in an active market and is classified as Level 1. 
 Equity securities - Common stocks and mutual funds are valued at the closing price reported on the active market on which the individual securities are traded and are classified as Level 1. 
 Fixed income securities - U.S. Treasury bills reflect the closing price on the active market in which the securities are traded and are classified as Level 1. Securities of U.S. agencies are valued using bid evaluations and are classified as Level 2. Corporate fixed income securities are valued using evaluated prices, such as dealer quotes, bids and offers and are therefore classified as Level 2. 
 Insurance contracts - Insurance contracts are investments with various insurance companies. The contract value represents the best estimate of fair value. These contracts do not hold any specific assets. These investments are classified as Level 3. 
 Real estate collective funds These funds are valued using the net asset value of the underlying properties. Net asset value is calculated using a combination of key inputs, such as revenue and expense growth rates, terminal capitalization rates and discount rates. 
 Pooled investment funds - These are public investment vehicles valued using the net asset value. The net asset value is based on the value of the assets owned by the plan, less liabilities. These investments are not quoted on an active exchange.

Deferred income taxes are not provided on undistributed earnings of international subsidiaries that are intended to be permanently invested in their operations. These undistributed earnings represent the post-income tax earnings under U.S. GAAP not adjusted for previously taxed income which aggregated approximately and at October 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Should these earnings be distributed, applicable foreign tax credits, distributions of previously taxed income, and utilization of other attributes would substantially offset taxes due upon the distribution. It is not practical to estimate the amount of additional taxes that might be payable on these basis differences because of the multiple methods by which these differences could reverse and the impact of withholding, U.S. state and local taxes and currency translation considerations.

 We are subject to United States Federal income tax as well as income taxes in numerous state and foreign jurisdictions. We are subject to examination in the U.S. by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for the 2018 through 2021 tax years; tax years prior to the 2018 year are closed to further examination by the IRS. Generally, major state and foreign jurisdiction tax years remain open to examination for tax years after 2015. Within the next twelve months, it is reasonably possible that certain statute of limitations periods would expire, which could result in a minimal decrease in our unrecognized tax benefits.

 primary operating segments: Industrial Precision Solutions and Advanced Technology Solutions. The composition of segments and measure of segment profitability is consistent with that used by our chief operating decision maker. The primary measure used by the chief operating decision maker for purposes of making decisions about allocating resources to the segments and assessing performance is operating profit, which equals sales less cost of sales and certain operating expenses. Items below the operating profit line of the Consolidated Statement of Income (interest and investment income, interest expense and other income/expense) are excluded from the measure of segment profitability reviewed by our chief operating decision maker and are not presented by operating segment. The accounting policies of the segments are generally the same as those described in Note 1, Significant Accounting Policies. 
 Effective in the second quarter of 2020, we made changes to realign our management team and our operating segments. This realignment will enable us to better serve global customers and markets, to more efficiently leverage technology synergies, to operate divisions of significant size in a consistent and focused way and to position ourselves for our next chapter of profitable growth. The revised operating segments better reflect how we manage the Company, allocate resources, and assess performance of the businesses. 
 We realigned our former operating segments into : Industrial Precision Solutions and Advanced Technology Solutions. Existing product lines were unchanged as part of this new structure. 
 Industrial Precision Solutions: This segment combines our former Adhesive Dispensing Systems (ADS) and Industrial Coating Systems (ICS) businesses. IPS enhances the technology synergies between ADS and ICS to deliver proprietary dispensing and processing technology to diverse end markets. Product lines reduce material consumption, increase line efficiency and enhance product brand and appearance. Components are used for dispensing adhesives, coatings, paint, finishes, sealants and other materials. This segment primarily serves the industrial, consumer durables and non-durables markets. 
 Advanced Technology Solutions: This segment integrates our proprietary product technologies found in progressive stages of a customer s production processes, such as surface treatment, precisely controlled dispensing of material and post-dispense test

The liability for environmental remediation represents management s best estimate of the probable and reasonably estimable undiscounted costs related to known remediation obligations. The accuracy of our estimate of environmental liability is affected by several uncertainties such as additional requirements that may be identified in connection with remedial activities, the complexity and evolution of environmental laws and regulations, and the identification of presently unknown remediation requirements. Consequently, our liability could be greater than our current estimate. However, we do not expect that the costs associated with remediation will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.

 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
 To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Nordson Corporation 
 Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 We have audited Nordson Corporation s internal control over financial reporting as of October 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Nordson Corporation (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of October 31, 2021, based on the COSO criteria. 
 We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of October 31, 2021 and 2020, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended October 31, 2021, and the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a) and our report dated December 17, 2021 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. 
 Basis for Opinion 
 The Company s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. 
 Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
 To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Nordson Corporation 
 Opinion on the Financial Statements 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Nordson Corporation (the Company) as of October 31, 2021 and 2020 , the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended October 31, 2021 , and the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a) (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements ). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at October 31, 2021 and 2020 , and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended October 31, 2021 , in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 
 We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of October 31, 2021 , based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated December 17, 2021 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. 
 Basis for Opinion 
 These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 Critical Audit Matter 
 The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the account or disclosure to which it relates.

 Valuation of Goodwill Description of the Matter At October 31, 2021, the Company had 1,713,148 thousand of goodwill. As discussed in Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company evaluates the carrying amount of goodwill for impairment annually as of August 1, and between annual evaluations if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate the fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying amount of those assets. The Company performed a quantitative impairment test for all reporting units in fiscal 2021. As part of the quantitative impairment test, the Company estimated the fair value of each reporting unit using a combination of valuation techniques including the discounted cash flow method, a form of the income approach, and the guideline public company method, a form of the market approach. 
 Auditing management s annual goodwill impairment assessment relating to goodwill was complex due to the use of valuation methodologies in the determination of the estimated fair values of the reporting units. These fair value estimates are impacted by assumptions such as the selection of comparable guideline companies and the related valuation multiples, as well as discount rates, revenue growth rates, and operating margins which are affected by expectations about future market or economic conditions. 
 How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company s goodwill impairment process whereby the Company develops assumptions that are used as inputs to the annual goodwill impairment test. This included controls over management's review of the valuation models and the assumptions, described above. 
 To test the implied fair value of the Company s reporting units, we performed audit procedures that included, among others, assessing the valuation methodologies, testing the assumptions, and testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data. We involved our internal valuation specialists in assessing the fair value methodologies applied and evaluating the reasonableness of certain assumptions selected by management. We assessed the historical accuracy of management s estimates and performed sensitivity analyses of assumptions to evaluate the changes in the fair value of the reporting units that would result from changes in the assumptions. We tested management s reconciliation of the fair value of the reporting units to the market capitalization of the Company. We also assessed the appropriateness of the disclosures in the consolidated financial statements.
