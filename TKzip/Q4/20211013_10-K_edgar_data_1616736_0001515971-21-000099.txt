uncertainties and other factors which may cause actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future
results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements were based
on various factors and were derived utilizing numerous assumptions and other factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially
from those in the forward-looking statements. These factors include, but are not limited to, our ability to consummate a merger or business
combination, economic, political and market conditions and fluctuations, government and industry regulation, interest rate risk, U.S.

You should consider the areas of risk described in connection with any forward-looking statements that may be made herein. Readers are
cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this annual report. Readers
should carefully review this annual report in its entirety, including but not limited to our consolidated financial statements and the
notes thereto. Except for our ongoing obligations to disclose material information under the Federal securities laws, we undertake no
obligation to release publicly any revisions to any forward-looking statements, to report events or to report the occurrence of unanticipated
events. For any forward-looking statements contained in any document, we claim the protection of the safe harbor for forward-looking statements
contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. 

Unless the context otherwise requires, references
in this annual report to Alpha Investment , ALPC , the Company , we , 
 our and us refers to Alpha Investment Inc. and its subsidiaries. 

Unless otherwise specifically indicated, all Share
and per Share information in this annual report gives pro forma effect to the capital restructuring which will be implemented prior to
closing of the Offering as described in - Capital Restructuring in Item 1 below. 

Item 1. Business 

Overview 

We intend to provide capital directly to borrowers
seeking financing for commercial real estate properties either for refinancing or acquisitions. These loans will encompass originating
performing commercial first mortgage loans, subordinate financings, and other commercial real estate-related debt. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, we intend to operate our business so that we do not become subject to the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended. Accordingly,
we do not plan to primarily engage in the business of investing, reinvesting or trading in securities and we do not plan to acquire investment
securities (such as commercial mortgage-backed securities) having a value exceeding 40 of the value of the Company s total assets. 

We expect to offer financing across a broad-spectrum
of asset backed and commercial real asset type collateral of any property type such as office, retail, industrial, multi-family, and hospitality.
The Company will coordinate its lending initiatives with outside commercial real estate loan brokers, which have access to commercial
real estate owners seeking financing or refinancing opportunities, and with loan origination firms that have borrowers seeking loans.
We believe that this will enable ALPC to broaden its access to new borrowers and to develop and implement financing solutions for these
other lenders, mortgage bankers, borrowers, and owners. In the event the Company uses third party loan origination services and underwriters,
the Company will cover these costs in accordance with industry standard practices. In addition, the Company from time to time will also
engage in participating equity financing within strategic opportunistic projects and businesses that could bring added value to stockholders. 

The Company expects to require substantial capital
to fully fund and implement its operations. The Company plans to raise such capital through private or public offerings of equity, debt
or other securities or through joint venture partnerships. There can be no assurance that the Company can successfully raise such capital
or consummate any offering or joint venture partnerships on favorable terms or otherwise. If such efforts are not successful, then we
may be unable to honor funding commitments or be forced to curtail our operations or consider other strategic alternatives. 

Investment Strategy 

To identify attractive lending opportunities, the
Company expects to continue to deploy its capital through the origination of commercial mortgage loans, subordinate financings and other
commercial real-estate related debt investments at attractive risk-adjusted yields. The Company targets lending opportunities that are
secured by commercial real estate. The Company s underwriting includes a focus on stressed in-place cash flows, debt yields, debt
service coverage ratios, loan-to-value ratios, property quality and market and sub-market dynamics.

Alameda Partners Joint Venture 

On March 11, 2019, the Company, through Alpha Mortgage
Notes I, LLC, a special purpose vehicle (the SPV ), entered into an operating agreement for the SPV (the SPV
Operating Agreement with Alameda Partners LLC, a Utah limited liability company Alameda Partners ). Pursuant
to the SPV Operating Agreement, Alameda Partners contributed 1,000,000 for a ten percent (10 ownership interest in the SPV and became
the SPV s manager. The capital is being used to implement the Company s strategy of acquiring performing commercial real estate
loans. The members of Alameda Partners have significant long-term experience in the commercial real estate industry as property developers,
owners, and managers and currently hold title to over 50 million in commercial real estate assets. 

Legacy Sand Joint Venture 

On July 30, 3020, Alpha entered into a joint venture
transaction with Parsons Energy Group, LLC Parsons with respect to leasehold mining rights then held by Parsons
on approximately 1,200 acres located in Independence, Wisconsin, containing an estimated 1110 Million Tons of Tier 1 Northern White Fracking
Sand. In connection therewith, the mining rights were assigned by Parsons to Legacy Sand Group, LLC, a newly-organized Florida limited
liability company Legacy Sand ), which was formed to exploit the fracking rights. Contemporaneously therewith, Alpha
acquired a nineteen percent (19 limited liability company membership interest in Legacy Sands (the Interest ), in
exchange for the issuance to Parsons of 3,382 shares of Alpha s Series 2020 Preferred Stock (the Series 2020 Preferred
Shares ). 

However, despite using its best efforts, pending Legacy
Sand commencing operations and generating revenues, the Company was not been able to sufficiently establish the valuation of the Interest
and the Series 2020 Preferred Shares to the satisfaction of its independent registered public accounting firm, in order to allow the Interest
to be reflected as an asset on the Company s balance sheet included in its periodic reports filed with the SEC under the Securities
Act of 1934, as amended. 

Accordingly, on July 21, 2021, the Company and Parsons
entered into an Unwinding Agreement (the Unwinding Agreement ), pursuant to which the joint venture was unwound. Under
the Unwinding Agreement, Parsons returned the Series 2020 Preferred Shares to the Company for cancellation and the Company assigned the
Interest in Legacy Sand back to Parsons and exchanged mutual releases. As a result of the unwinding of the Legacy Sand joint venture,
Alpha has had to restate its financial statements for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 and the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2020, included in its previously filed Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for those periods. 

Capital Restructuring 

In order to provide the Company with an improved
capital structure effective June 30, 2021, the Company implemented a capital restructuring pursuant to which: 

Omega, our principal stockholder exchanged 32,535,000 shares of our
common stock it held for 100,000 shares of newly designated Series AA Preferred Stock; and 

Holders of an additional 1,965,000 shares of our common stock contributed
such shares to the capital of the Company. 

Each share of Series AA Preferred Stock is convertible
at the option of the holder into ten (10) shares of the Company s common stock for an aggregate of 1,000,000 shares of common stock,
subject to adjustment for stock splits, stock dividends and similar transactions. The Series AA Preferred Stock has a liquidation preference
of 1.00 per share and is entitled to share ratably in dividends declared on the Company s common stock on an as converted 
basis. 

Each share of Series AA Preferred Stock is entitled
to 450 votes on each matter presented to stockholders (subject to adjustment for stock splits, stock dividends and similar transactions).
Shares of Series AA Preferred Stock vote together shares of our common stock as a single class, except as required by Delaware law. Accordingly,
Omega, as the holder of the Series AA Preferred Stock will effectively maintain control over the Company s affairs following implementation
of the capital restructuring and the consummation of this Offering. 

Unless otherwise specifically indicted, all Share
and per Share information in this annual report gives pro forma effect to implementation of the capital restructuring

Potential Effects of the COVID-19 Pandemic on our
Business 

Commercial mortgage lending may be subject to volatility
during the COVID-19 pandemic and may be adversely affected by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, national, regional and
local economic conditions; local real estate conditions; changes or continued weakness in specific industry segments; construction quality,
age and design; demographic factors; retroactive changes to building or similar codes; pandemics; natural disasters and other acts of
god. In addition, decreases in property values reduce the value of the collateral and the potential proceeds available to a borrower to
repay the underlying loans or loans, as the case may be, which could also cause us to suffer losses. Market volatility has been particularly
heightened due to the COVID-19 global pandemic. COVID-19 has disrupted economic activities and could have a continued significant adverse
effect on economic and market conditions including limited lending from financial institutions, depressed asset values, and limited market
liquidity. At the present time, we are unable to estimate the potential adverse effect which the pandemic may have on our business, operations
and financial condition. 

Corporate History 

We were incorporated in the State of Delaware
on February 22, 2013, to develop, create, manufacture and market toys for small children which would be designed to attach to car seats
and amuse and entertain children during a drive, without distracting the attention of the driver. The Company, however, encountered significant
constraints in raising sufficient capital to fully implement its business plan. 

On March 17, 2017, Omega purchased 35,550,000
outstanding shares of the Company s common stock (the Control Share Sale from Malcolm Hargrave (35,000,000
shares), DTH International Corporation (500,000 shares) and Lisa Foster (50,000 shares) for aggregate consideration of 295,000. The Control
Share Sale was consummated in a private transaction pursuant to a common stock purchase agreement entered between Omega and Mr. Hargrave,
acting individually and on behalf of the other selling stockholders. Upon completion of the Control Share Sale, a Change in
Control of the Company took place and in connection therewith, Mr. Hargrave resigned as our sole director and officer and Omega,
as the new majority stockholder of the Company, elected Timothy R. Fussell, Ph.D. as President, Chairman of the Board and a director (Dr.
Fussell stepped down from those positions in April 2020) and Todd C. Buxton, Omega s then Chief Executive Officer, as Chief Executive
Officer, Vice Chairman of the Board and a director. 

In addition to the foregoing, new management elected
to shift the Company s business focus to real estate lending, which they believed offered better opportunities for shareholder growth.
In connection therewith, on March 30, 2017, we filed a Certificate of Amendment to our Certificate of Incorporation with the Delaware
Secretary of State changing our name from Gogo Baby, Inc. to Alpha Investment Inc. to better
reflect our new business plan. The name change and a corresponding change in the Company s OTC markets trading symbol from
GGBY to ALPC received approval from FINRA and became effective as of April 19, 2017. 

Plan of Operations 

Our core objective will be to achieve advantageous
yields and consistent interest income on short to long term loans Loans covering all four lending categories such
as prime, alt-A, bridge and hard money loans by: 

furnishing capital to make Loans primarily to borrowers such as commercial real estate developers and speculators, business owners, landlords and owners of core assets when traditional financing is unavailable to such borrowers for acquisitions, refinancing of commercial property loans; and 

making Loans directly to borrowers in the commercial real estate markets. 

We plan to administer various financing programs with
an emphasis on Loans secured by commercial real estate, such as office buildings, multi-family residences, shopping centers, industrial,
and hotels. Loans may consist of senior debt loans, mezzanine or subordinated loans, preferred equity and other equity participation financing
structures. 

We intend to follow a conservative lending 
profile for our Loans. Our strategy is to seek low leveraged first lien senior debt mortgage loans and high debt service structured
financing programs, as opposed to riskier, less secure, mezzanine or equity positions.

Business Objectives and Strategy 

Our core business objective is to achieve advantageous
and consistent rates of return from short to long term Loans to borrowers when traditional financing is unavailable to such borrowers
for acquisitions, refinancing of commercial property loans and other asset backed transactions. We plan to focus on various alternative
commercial real estate financings with an emphasis on Loans secured by commercial real estate and also seek to invest in financing of
core real estate assets that include office buildings, multi-family residences, shopping centers, and hospitality, plus ground up entitled
land developments. The Loans may consist of senior debt loans, mezzanine or subordinated loans, preferred equity and other equity participation
financing structures. We intend to follow a conservative lending profile for the Loans we fund, which means low loan to
value and high debt service cover ratios. Our strategy is to seek Loans that are first lien, senior debt mortgage loans and specialty
financing programs, as opposed to riskier, yet much more profitable, and less secure mezzanine or equity positions. 

Use of Loan Servicers 

In carrying out our business strategy, we will
likely utilize third-party firms that specialize in Loan origination and servicing Servicers ). We intend to
perform due diligence on each Servicer which we, directly or indirectly, plan to use in the origination and servicing of Loans, in order
to evaluate the firm s experience and expertise in originating and servicing Loans that satisfy our lending and investment criteria. 

Use of Other Third-Party Service Providers 

We will utilize other third parties to provide
various ancillary services to us, such as real estate evaluation and land feasibility appraisal services, closing-legal and escrow title
services. 

Sale of Participations; Co-Investments and Participations 

In the discretion of management, we may sell participation
rights in the Loans we originate to other entities. 

We may from time to time co-invest and or syndicate
participation interest in loans as the administrative agent or buying a participation interest. We plan to only employ this strategy with
seasoned well-established organizations in the commercial real estate CRE lending industry such as private trusts,
real estate financing institutions, mutual funds, pension funds, investment houses, or hedge fund of funds. We believe that this
will afford the Company with an additional opportunity to participate in well-structured transactions with organizations with proven track
records involving originating, underwriting, and servicing. 

The Commercial Real Estate Lending Product 

Operationally, management believes the market for
commercial mortgage loans will offer opportunities for the deployment of capital we raise. The CRE markets have suffered greatly
in recent years beginning with the 2008 U.S. financial market crisis, which resulted in a steep and prolonged recession. However, as the
lending markets have steadily recovered along with market leaders such as large banks Wells Fargo, JP Morgan Chase, Bank of America and
Capital One, we believe the CRE lending landscape has now stabilized in select Centralized Business Districts known as CBD s 
and afford extremely attractive opportunities for deploying capital. Thus, we will focus on positioning the Company to seize this opportunity
within this market. We believe that our proposed business model is comparable to that currently being used by some of the top-level
commercial real estate lender industry professionals. However, to compete and succeed within this industry, we plan to develop a proprietary
pricing and lending model for the commercial real estate finance debt and equity markets. If we are able to do so, as to which no
assurance can be given, we believe that we will have a strategic advantage to compete in the market. 

Key Operational Highlights 
CRE Loans 

The overall U.S. core property commercial real estate lending market is vast and accordingly, we believe there are significant business opportunities that will afford the Company continued growth. 

We expect that our lending model will allow for smaller increments of loans designed for quicker closings to permit investors to monitor development of the ongoing balance sheet and enable us to more rapidly achieve milestones. 

We plan to retain or use seasoned commercial real estate independent specialists to coordinate our loan underwriting model centered on mitigating loan-loss risks and to perform all other related and required third party due diligence. 

Since the securitization industry has standardized the underwriting criteria, we anticipate that it will allow for each third-party service provider we use to integrate and exchange information effectively and efficiently. 

We believe that we will have low cost and prudent leverage available to us to fund Loans. 

Our strategy has been developed with the input of experienced industry veterans.

The Commercial Real Estate Market Forecast 

Capital Markets : Notwithstanding the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and the attendant economic slowdown and market uncertainty, CBRE estimates that the capital markets will offer continued liquidity and low interest rates in 2021, which will lead to increased investment volume for the year, concentrated to a certain extent during the second half of the year, albeit with a shift in investor focus in certain sectors of the real estate industry. CBRE further believes that amid the uncertain global economic situation, U.S. commercial real estate will remain a haven for investment in 2021, when compared to foreign markets. 

Office/Occupier : The demand for office space during 2020 has significantly decreased as a result of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, with its shift to many employees working remotely. In addition to decreased demand, there have been comparable declines in rent growth and increases in vacancies during the latter part of 2020.. These trends were already being driven by the growth in flexible workplaces offered by providers such as WeWork, although expansion in this market segment has slowed as well. Notwithstanding the foregoing, CBRE estimates improvement in the office/occupier real estate market during 2021, and we. As well believe that there will still be significant opportunities in the office/occupier segment of the commercial real estate market. 

Industrial and Logistics : We believe that the continued growth in e-commerce, which has been further fueled by the COVID-19 pandemic, will result in significant growth in the industrial logistics I L market, as a result of providers increased demand for additional logistics space. According to CBRE, the I L market has been one of the bright spots during 2020 and will continue to be strong, although growth in this market segment may slow during 2021 as the COVID-19 pandemic recedes and consumers return to more traditional forms of retail shopping. 

Retail : 2020 results, particularly in brick and mortar retail stores, have seen significant adverse impacts as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Such adverse effects include the periodic shutdowns of non-essential businesses, increased retail vacancies as a result of the bankruptcy filing by and liquidation of a number of well-known retail chains and the overall impact of the significant increase in unemployment. However, the slowdown has opened opportunities to repurpose retail locations both in and outside of shopping malls. According to CBRE, many retail assets are expected to be converted to mixed use, creating communities and thriving town centers. In addition, CBRE believes that as the COVID-19 pandemic recedes during 2021, consumers will return to more traditional forms of retail shopping thereby generating growth in this market segment. 

Multifamily : According to CBRE, multifamily is positioned for continued favorable performance given current economic conditions but may experience some cooling due to new supply outpacing demand and the overall economic slowdown resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. CBRE believes that the best opportunities during 2021 will be in suburban markets, where urban dwellers are seeking to relocate as a result of having experienced COVID-19 stay-at-home orders in large urban centers. In addition, we believe that smaller metros and metro leaders with smaller multifamily market penetration, including Austin, Atlanta, Phoenix and Boston, will offer attractive investment opportunities. CBRE also reports that the trends affecting the multifamily housing market will also generate opportunities in other residential rental segments of the real estate industry, such as build-to-rent. 

Hotel : Perhaps no market segment has been as adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, as the hospitality industry. The significant decrease in travel has resulted and is expected to continue to result in numerous closures at all segments of the industry in both major and secondary markets, as well as decreased occupancy rates in hotels that remain open and operating. CBRE believes that the recovery in this market segment to start during 2021, although a full recovery is expected to take several years. In addition, to the start of the recovery during 2021, we believe that the shutdown of many hotels affords opportunities to repurpose many locations for other uses. 

Non-Traditional : According to CBRE, investment
 in non-traditional commercial real estate property types such as self-storage, data centers, medical office, life sciences, senior housing
 and student housing has seen significant growth over the last decade, with these market segments now accounting for an ever increasing
 share of overall real estate investment. CBRE believes that notwithstanding this trend will continue into 2021, notwithstanding softness
 in other market segments as a result of the effects of the COVID -19 pandemic. According to CBRE, reasons for this trend include: 

alternative assets offering higher cap rates; 

structural changes that have occurred over the last decade and are continuing to occur in business,
 technology demographics and society as a whole; 

the expanded product offerings and portfolio diversification that these non-traditional sectors afford
 investors; and 

increased transparency and availability of information with respect to the performance of investments
 in alternative market segments.

Loan Production Strategy 

We have access to a database of top commercial real
estate mortgage bankers nationwide through organizations such as Strategic Alliance Mortgage, LLC SAM ), which is
a company comprised of the top independently owned commercial real estate mortgage banking firms located throughout the United States.
Through SAM, firms utilizes their shared national knowledge to execute superior capital market solutions for developers, commercial real
estate investors, investment management firms, asset management firms, real estate investment trusts and private real estate equity firms
with the goal of utilizing their production networks. We have focused on firms that have experienced loan origination back office staff
to ensure our CRE Loan services will be appropriately and professionally marketed. Also, management has a proprietary database of 50 to
100 mortgage bankers to market their CRE Loan products to and generate Loan production internally for consistent deal flow. In addition,
we believe that as our operations expand, we always have the opportunity to establish and retain an in-house sales team. 

Competition 

A number of much larger proven commercial real estate
lenders such as JP Morgan Chase, Bank of America, Goldman, Apollo Commercial Real Estate, and RAIT currently have established operations
with large balance sheets and back office staff. However, we are a non-banking institution and are not regulated like the larger banks
or typical CMBS lenders in that we are not pigeon-holed into securitizing our assets. Rather, we elect to use these
industry standards and underwriting characteristics to originate loans, to consequently
mitigate liquidly-risk (i.e. recapitalization) with the ability to hold these loans on the un-tainted balance sheet in order to garner
stable income to yield strong growth and market share. However, as most of these lenders have far longer operating histories and significantly
larger financial resources than we do, there can be no assurance given that we can effectively compete. 

Employees 

We currently have no employees other than our
executive officers. As noted above, we intend to rely on third parties retained by us for services in areas such as loan origination and
production, credit analysis, underwriting, due diligence, and loan servicing. As our operations grow, we may elect to bring certain, if
not all of these services in house.

Critical Accounting Policies 

Use of Estimates 

The preparation of financial statements in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make certain estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods presented.
The Company is required to make judgments and estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. The Company
regularly evaluates estimates and assumptions related to the valuation of the allowance for loan losses, loss contingencies, useful
life and recoverability of long-lived assets, deferred income tax asset valuations and loss contingencies. The Company bases its
estimates and assumptions on current facts, historical experience and various other factors that it believes to be reasonable under
the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities
and the accrual of costs and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Although, we believe our judgments and
estimates are appropriate, actual future results may be different; if different assumptions or conditions were to prevail, the
results could be materially different from our reported results. 

Loans Receivable, net and Allowance for
Losses 

The Company records its investments in loans
receivable at cost less unamortized costs of issuance and deferred origination fees. Origination fees collected at the time of
investment are recorded against the loans receivable and amortized into net interest income over the lives of the related loans.
Issuance costs incurred are capitalized along with the initial investment and amortized against net interest income over the lives
of the related loans. 

When a loan receivable is placed on non-accrual
status, the related interest receivable is reversed against interest income of the current period. If a non-accrual loan is returned
to accrual status, the accrued interest existing at the date the residential loan is placed on non-accrual status and interest
during the non-accrual period are recorded as interest income as of the date the loan no longer meets the non-accrual criteria. 

The Company maintains
an allowance for loan losses on its investments in real estate loans receivable for estimated credit impairment. Management s
estimate of losses is based on a number of factors including the types and dollar amounts of loans in the portfolio, adverse situations
that may affect the borrower s ability to repay, prevailing economic conditions and the underlying collateral securing the
loan. Additions to the allowance are provided through a charge to earnings and are based on an assessment of certain
factors, which may indicate estimated losses on the loans. Actual losses on loans are recorded first as a reduction
to the allowance for loan losses. Generally, subsequent recoveries of amounts previously charged off are recognized
as income. 

Estimating allowances
for loan losses requires significant judgment about the underlying collateral, including liquidation value, condition of the collateral,
competency and cooperation of the related borrower and specific legal issues that affect loan collections or taking possession
of the property on an individual loan receivable basis. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

There are no off-balance sheet arrangements
that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition,
revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING
FIRM 

 To the Board of Directors and 
Stockholders of Alpha Investment Inc. 

 Opinion on the Financial Statements 

 We have audited the accompanying consolidated
balance sheet of Alpha Investment Inc. (the Company) as of December 31, 2019 , and the related consolidated statements of operations,
stockholders deficit and cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2019, and the related notes (collectively referred to
as the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of the Company as of December 31, 2019 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year ended December
31, 2019, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 

 Explanatory Paragraph- Going Concern 

 The accompanying financial statements have been
prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, the Company
has suffered recurring losses. As of and for the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company had a net loss of 1,697,245, had net
cash used provided by operating activities of negative 2,041,111, accumulated deficit of 4,019,729 and working capital of 2,463,559.
These factors raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management s plans in regard to these
matters are also described in Note 2. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome
of this uncertainty. 

 Basis for Opinion 

 These financial statements are the responsibility
of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based
on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB)
and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable
rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

 We conducted our audit in accordance with the
standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have,
nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audit, we are required
to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the
effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

 Our audit included performing procedures to assess
the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond
to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as
well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis
for our opinion.

 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 

 Years Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 

NOTE 1 ORGANIZATION AND DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS 

Corporate History 

Alpha Investment Inc, formerly GoGo Baby, Inc.
(the Company was incorporated on February 22, 2013 under the laws of the State of Delaware to develop, create, manufacture
and market, toys for small children which would be designed to attach to car seats and amuse and entertain children during a drive,
without distracting the attention of the driver. The Company, however, encountered significant constraints in raising sufficient
capital to fully implement its business plan. 

TO better reflecting management s shifted
focus of the Company s business to real estate and other commercial lending, on March 30, 2017, the Company filed a Certificate
of Amendment to its Certificate of Incorporation with the Delaware Secretary of State changing its name from Gogo Baby,
Inc. to Alpha Investment Inc. . The name change and a corresponding change in the Company s OTC
markets trading symbol from GGBY to ALPC received approval from FINRA and became effective as of April 19, 2017. 

On January 31, 2019, the Company, through Jersey
Walk Phase I, LLC, entered into a Sale of Membership Interest Agreement (the Purchase Agreement with CMT Developers
LLC CMT ). Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, the Company acquired 100 of CMT s membership interests,
in exchange for the issuance to CMT of 3,000,000 shares of common stock. During the due diligence on the refinancing of the
property, the Company learned that certain of the representations and warranties of CMT in the Purchase Agreement with respect
to the property were incorrect in various material respects. Based on the foregoing, effective June 7, 2019, the Company rescinded
the Purchase Agreement in accordance with its terms and the 3,000,000 shares of common stock were returned to the Company. As of
June 7, 2019, the Company deconsolidated CMT, recognizing a gain on deconsolidation of 316,774. The assets, liabilities and equity
related to CMT, resulting in the gain on deconsolidation are summarized as follows: 

Note Payable 
 15,500,000 
 
 Accrued Interest 
 232,500 
 
 Deferred Income 
 576,774

On March 11, 2019, the Company, through a newly
formed LLC or Special Purpose Vehicle SPV called Alpha Mortgage Notes I, LLC executed an operating agreement with
Alameda Partners LLC. Alameda Partners is a Utah Limited Liability Company which made a capital contribution of 1,000,000, which
was paid to the Company, for 10 ownership of the SPV, and will be the managing member. The capital shall be used to implement
the strategy of acquiring commercial real estate performing notes and support other related growth initiatives and assets acquisitions
for the Company of which is positioning for its up-listing to the NYSE. The Members of Alameda Partners LLC have decades of experiences
in the commercial real estate industry as property developers, owners, and managers and currently holds over 50-million
in commercial real estate assets. They have been appointed as the Managing Members of the SPV, while ALPC controls and holds 90 
ownership. In exchange for its 90 interest in the SPV, the Company is required to contribute 4,015,667 shares of common
stock for the purchase of performing notes for the SPV. The special purpose vehicle was organized to acquire the membership interests,
develop, own, hold, sell, lease, transfer, exchange, re-lend, manage and operate the underlying assets and conduct activities related
thereto the ownership of commercial real estate mortgage notes and REO s. The initial 1,000,000 was recorded as additional
paid in capital on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. Alameda Partners is entitled to monthly distributions in cash and
stock equal to 10,000. For the years ended December 31, 2020, the Company has recorded 220,000 of distributions as reductions
to non-controlling interest, which has been accrued and included in Distributions Payable on the accompanying consolidated balance
sheet as of December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2020, Alpha Mortgage Notes I, LLC has not completed any transactions. 

On June 2,
2020, the Company acquired a 19 membership interest in Legacy Sand Group, LLC Legacy ), which owns real property and mining
rights comprised of approximately 1,200 acres that encompass an asset of 110 million tons of Tier 1 Northern White Fracking Sand in Wisconsin.
As consideration for the acquisition, the Company issued 3,382 shares of 2020 Convertible Preferred Stock, which is convertible into
3,804,750 shares of the Company s common stock. The Company recorded its interest in Legacy at the estimated fair value of the
preferred stock of 33,323,000. 

F- 8 

However, despite using its best efforts,
pending Legacy Sand commencing operations and generating revenues, the Company was not been able to sufficiently establish the valuation
of the Interest and the Series 2020 Preferred Shares to the satisfaction of its independent registered public accounting firm, in order
to allow the Interest to be reflected as an asset on the Company s balance sheet included in its periodic reports filed with the
SEC under the Securities Act of 1934, as amended. 

Accordingly, on July 29, 2021, the
Company and Parsons entered into an Unwinding Agreement (the Unwinding Agreement ), pursuant to which the joint venture
was unwound. Under the Unwinding Agreement, Parsons returned the Series 2020 Preferred Shares to the Company for cancellation and the
Company assigned the Interest in Legacy Sand back to Parsons and exchanged mutual releases. 

NOTE 2 GOING CONCERN 

Future issuances of the Company s
equity or debt securities will be required in order for the Company to continue to finance its operations and continue as a
going concern. The Company s present revenues are insufficient to meet operating expenses. The financial statement of
the Company have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates, among other
things, the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company used
 547,182 and 2,041,111 in cash in operations, and incurred net losses of 1,069,216 and 1,697,245 during the years ended
December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The Company has an accumulated deficit of 5,130,212 as of December 31, 2020 and
requires capital for its contemplated operational and marketing activities to take place. The Company's ability to raise
additional capital through the future issuances of common stock is unknown. Securing additional financing, the successful
development of the Company's contemplated plan of operations, and its transition, ultimately, to the attainment of profitable
operations are necessary for the Company to continue operations. The ability to successfully resolve these factors raise
substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. The consolidated financial statements of the
Company do not include any adjustments that may result from the outcome of these aforementioned uncertainties. 

NOTE 3 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT
ACCOUNTING POLICIES 

Principles of Consolidation 

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the
Company, Alpha Mortgage Notes I, LLC, which is controlled by the Company through its 90 ownership interest, and Paris Med CP-LLC Paris Med ), variable interest entity for which the Company is deemed to be the primary beneficiary, (collectively,
the Company ). All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. 

Use of Estimates 

The preparation of financial statements in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make certain estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods presented.
The Company is required to make judgments and estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. The Company
regularly evaluates estimates and assumptions related to the useful life and recoverability of long-lived assets, deferred income
tax asset valuations and loss contingences. The Company bases its estimates and assumptions on current facts, historical experience
and various other factors that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making
judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities and the accrual of costs and expenses that are not readily apparent
from other sources. Although, we believe our judgments and estimates are appropriate, actual future results may be different; if
different assumptions or conditions were to prevail, the results could be materially different from our reported results. 

Cash and Cash Equivalents 

Cash equivalents include short-term, highly
liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the time of acquisition. 

Restricted Cash Held in Escrow 

As of December 31, 2019, the Company had approximately
 2,509,000 of restricted cash held in escrow from the sale of commons stock to an investor that has the right to require the Company
to repurchase common stock for 2,500,000 through September 2020. In February 2020, the holder exercised its option. . As of December
31, 2020, restricted cash held in escrow was nil. See Note 9 

Loans Receivable, net and Allowance for Losses 

The Company records its investments in loans
receivable at the lower of cost or fair value, Costs are the gross loan receivables less unamortized costs of issuance and deferred
origination fees. Origination fees collected at the time of investment are recorded against the loans receivable and amortized
into net interest income over the lives of the related loans. Issuance costs incurred are capitalized along with the initial investment
and amortized against net interest income over the lives of the related loans. 

F- 9 

When a loan receivable is placed on non-accrual
status, the related interest receivable is charged to bad debt of the current period. If a non-accrual loan is returned to accrual
status, the accrued interest existing at the date the residential loan is placed on non-accrual status and interest during the
non-accrual period are recorded as interest income as of the date the loan no longer meets the non-accrual criteria. 

The Company maintains
an allowance for loan losses on its investments in real estate loans receivable for estimated credit impairment. Management s
estimate of losses is based on a number of factors including the types and dollar amounts of loans in the portfolio, adverse situations
that may affect the borrower s ability to repay, prevailing economic conditions and the underlying collateral securing the
loan. Additions to the allowance are provided through a charge to earnings and are based on an assessment of certain
factors, which may indicate estimated losses on the loans. Actual losses on loans are recorded first as a reduction
to the allowance for loan losses. Generally, subsequent recoveries of amounts previously charged off are recognized
as income. 

Estimating allowances for loan losses requires
significant judgment about the underlying collateral, including liquidation value, condition of the collateral, competency and
cooperation of the related borrower and specific legal issues that affect loan collections or taking possession of the property on
an individual loan receivable basis. Management has established an allowance of 250,000 as of December 31, 2020,
and determined that no allowance for loan losses was necessary as of December 31, 2019. 

Property and Equipment 

Property and equipment are stated at cost.
Equipment and fixtures are depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated asset lives, 5 years. 

Income Taxes 

The Company accounts for its income taxes in
accordance with FASB Accounting Standards Codification ASC No. 740, Income Taxes . Under this method,
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial
statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax balances. Deferred tax assets and liabilities
are measured using enacted or substantially enacted tax rates expected to apply to the taxable income in the years in which those
differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion
of management, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The effect
on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the date of
enactment or substantive enactment. 

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes 

The Company applies the provisions of ASC Topic
740-10-25, Income Taxes Overall Recognition ASC Topic 740-10-25 with respect to the accounting
for uncertainty of income tax positions. ASC Topic 740-10-25 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized
in a company s consolidated financial statements and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the
financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. ASC Topic 740-10-25
also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and
transition. As December 31, 2020, tax years since 2013 remain open for IRS audit. The Company has received no notice of audit from
the Internal Revenue Service for any of the open tax years. 

Revenue Recognition and Investment Income 

Origination fees collected at the time of investment
are recorded against the loans receivable and amortized into net interest income over the lives of the related loans. Issuance
costs incurred are capitalized along with the initial investment and amortized against net interest income over the lives of the
related loans. The Company records interest income in accordance with ASC subtopic 835-30 Imputation of Interest , using
the effective interest method. The following is a summary of the components of the Company s net investment income for the
years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:

When a loan is placed on non-accrual status,
the related interest receivable is charged to bad debt of the current period. If a non-accrual loan is returned to accrual status,
the accrued interest existing at the date the residential loan is placed on non-accrual status and interest during the non-accrual
period are recorded as interest income as of the date the loan no longer meets the non-accrual criteria. 

F- 10 

The Company suspends recognizing interest
income when it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect all payments according to the contractual terms of the underlying
agreements. Management considers all information available in assessing collectability. Collectability is measured on a receivable-by-receivable
basis by either the present value of estimated future cash flows discounted at the effective rate, the observable market price
for the receivable or the fair value of the collateral if the receivable is collateral dependent. Large groups of smaller balance
homogeneous receivables, such as pre-settlement funding transactions, are collectively assessed for collectability. Receivables,
including those arising from the sale of loan origination services, is charged off when in the Company's judgment, the receivable
or portion of the receivable is considered uncollectible. 

Payments received on past due receivables and
finance receivables the Company has suspended recognizing interest income on are applied first to principal and then to accrued
interest. Interest income on past due receivables and finance receivables, if received, is recorded using the cash basis method
of accounting. Additionally, the Company generally does not resume recognition of interest income once it has been suspended. 

Variable Interest Entity 

The Company holds a 10 interest in Paris Med,
of which the remaining 90 interest is held by the Company s parent company. Through December 31, 2020, the Company
has provided 100 of the funding to Paris Med, which has provided a construction loan to a third party. This loan receivable
is the sole asset of Paris Med. The Company determined that Paris Med was a variable interest entity based on various qualitative
and quantitative factors including but not limited to: 1) financing of Paris Med s sole asset was received by the Company,
which is disproportionate to the Company s ownership interest and 2) the Company and Omega, a related party, organized the
entity for the purpose of facilitating the Company s activities. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company is considered
the primary beneficiary because it has provided substantially all of its financial support and is the only party at risk. As
of December 31, 2020, Paris Med has total assets of 558,000, consisting solely of advances made pursuant to its third-party construction
loan agreement, and had no liabilities. 100 of the funding for the sole asset was provided by the Company and such amounts are
eliminated in consolidation. See Note 3. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, Paris Med had no activity
other than accruing interest on outstanding principal. The Company will evaluate its investments in Paris Med each reporting
period to determine if it is still the primary beneficiary, and if no longer considered the primary beneficiary, deconsolidate
Paris Med in the period in which circumstances change or events occur causing a change in its assessment. The Company has
not attributed any of its net loss or equity to non-controlling interest because Paris Med s sole asset is amounts owed to
the Company, which is eliminated in consolidation, and there was no material income earned or losses incurred to date by Paris
Med. 

Fair Value 

The carrying amounts reported in the balance
sheet for cash, accounts payable and notes payable approximate their estimated fair market value based on the short-term maturity
of this instrument. The carrying value of the Company s loans receivable approximate fair value because their terms approximate
market rates. 

Net Loss Per Share 

Basic loss per share is computed by dividing
the net loss available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the year. Dilutive
loss per share reflects the potential dilution of securities that could share in the losses of the Company. 166,667 shares underlying
convertible preferred stock and 350,000 shares of common stock underlying common stock warrants were excluded from the computation
of diluted loss per share for year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, because their impact was anti-dilutive. 

Concentration of Credit Risk 

Financial instruments that potentially subject
the Company to significant concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents and loans receivable. The
Company maintains its cash in bank and financial institution deposits that at times may exceed federally insured limits. Management has established an allowance of 250,000 as of December 31,
2020, and determined that no allowance for loan losses was necessary as of December 31, 2019. 

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements 

Recent accounting pronouncements that the Company
has adopted or that will be required to adopt in the future are summarized below. 

In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01, Financial
Instruments - Overall (Subtopic 825- 10), Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities . The
provisions of the update require equity investments to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income.
However, an entity may choose to measure equity investments that do not have readily determinable fair values at cost minus impairment.
The update also simplifies the impairment assessment of equity investments without readily determinable fair values by requiring
a qualitative assessment to identify impairment. It also eliminates the requirement to disclose the fair value of financial instruments
measured at amortized cost for entities that are not public business entities, and eliminates the requirement for public business
entities to disclose the methods and significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value for financial instruments measured
at amortized cost on the balance sheet. ASU No. 2016-01 requires public business entities to use the exit price notion when measuring
the fair value of financial instruments for disclosure purposes. It also requires an entity to present separately in other 

F- 11 

comprehensive
income the portion of the total change in the fair value of a liability resulting from a change in the instrument-specific credit
risk when the entity has elected to measure the liability at fair value in accordance with the fair value option for financial
instruments. The update requires separate presentation of financial assets and financial liabilities by category and form on the
balance sheet or the accompanying notes to the financial statements. In addition, the update clarifies that an entity should evaluate
the need for a valuation allowance on a deferred tax asset related to available-for-sale securities
in combination with the entity s other deferred tax assets. The adoption of this ASU did not have a material impact on the Company s financial statements. 

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases
(Topic 842), Conforming Amendments Related to Leases . This ASU amends the codification regarding leases in order to increase
transparency and comparability. The ASU requires companies to recognize lease assets and liabilities on the statement of condition
and disclose key information about leasing arrangements. A lessee would recognize a liability to make lease payments and a right-of-use
asset representing its right to use the leased asset for the lease term. The new lease guidance was effective for fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 2018, and did not have a material effect on the Company s financial statements. 

In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial
Instruments Credit Losses (Topic 326), Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments . The amendments introduce
an impairment model that is based on expected credit losses ECL ), rather than incurred losses, to estimate credit
losses on certain types of financial instruments (ex. loans and held to maturity securities), including certain off-balance sheet
financial instruments (ex. commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit that are not unconditionally cancelable).
The ECL should consider historical information, current information, and reasonable and supportable forecasts, including estimates
of prepayments, over the contractual term. An entity must use judgment in determining the relevant information and estimation methods
that are appropriate in its circumstances. Financial instruments with similar risk characteristics may be grouped together when
estimating the ECL. The ASU also amends the current available for sale security impairment model for debt securities whereby credit
losses relating to available for sale debt securities should be recorded through an allowance for credit losses. The amendments will be applied through a modified retrospective approach,
resulting in a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the first reporting period in which the
guidance is effective. The Company is currently planning for the implementation of this accounting standard. It is too early to
assess the impact this guidance will have on the Company s financial statements. 

In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15, Statement
of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments . The amendments in this ASU clarify the
proper classification for certain cash receipts and cash payments, including clarification on debt prepayment or debt extinguishment
costs, settlement of zero-coupon debt instruments, contingent consideration payments made after a business combination, proceeds
from the settlement of insurance claims, and proceeds from the settlement of corporate-owned life insurance policies, including
bank-owned life insurance policies, among others. The
Company adoption of this amendment did not have a material impact on the Company s Financial Statements. 

The Company has implemented all new accounting
pronouncements that are in effect and that may impact its financial statements and does not believe that there are any other new
accounting pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations.

with all income going to the Company and has entered into a construction loan agreement with an unrelated party, CMT Developers,
LLC CMT ), pursuant to which, CMT executed a promissory note in the favor of Jersey Walk in the amount of 73,496,002.
This amount was to be advanced to CMT as required for the completion of the construction and development of two multi-family residences
in Lakewood, New Jersey. All amounts advanced under the construction loan agreement were secured by the construction project
and due by September 30, 2028. The acquisition of Jersey Walk was rescinded on June 6, 2019, as of which date, 310,000 had

NOTE 5 - PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES 

Realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon
sufficient future taxable income during the period that deductible temporary differences and carry-forwards are expected to be available
to reduce taxable income. As the achievement of required future taxable income is uncertain, the Company recorded a valuation allowance.
As of December 31, 2020 the Company had a net operating loss carry-forward of approximately 2,753,651. Net operating loss carry-forwards
incurred before 2018 generally expire twenty years from the date the loss was incurred, beginning in 2023, and losses incurred after
2018 are subject to annual limitations. 

The Company is subject to United States federal
and state income taxes at an approximate blended state and federal rate of 29 . The reconciliation of the provision for income
taxes at the United States federal statutory rate compared to the Company s income tax expense as reported is as follows:

Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences
between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes.
Deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences in the recognition of income and expenses for financial reporting and tax
purposes. The significant components of deferred income tax assets and liabilities at December 31, 2020 and 2019 are as follows:

 Net Deferred income tax asset 
 - 
 - 

The Company has recognized a valuation allowance
for the deferred income tax asset since the Company cannot be assured that it is more likely than not that such benefit will be
utilized in future years. The valuation allowance is reviewed annually. The Company s valuation allowance increased by 316,478 
and 305,064 during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. When circumstances change and which cause a change
in management s judgment about the realizability of deferred income tax assets, the impact of the change on the valuation
allowance is generally reflected in current income. 

Current law limits the amount of loss available
to be offset against future taxable income when a substantial change in ownership occurs. Therefore, the amount available to offset
future taxable income may be limited.

NOTE 8 STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY 

Incentive Plan 

The Company s
Incentive Plan provides for equity incentives to be granted to its employees, executive officers or directors or to key advisers
or consultants. Equity incentives may be in the form of stock options with an exercise price not less than the fair market value
of the underlying Shares as determined pursuant to the Incentive Plan, restricted stock awards, other stock-based awards, or any
combination of the foregoing. The Incentive Plan is administered by the board of directors, and 5,000,000 Shares are reserved for
issuance pursuant to the exercise of awards under the Incentive Plan. The number of shares so reserved automatically
adjusts upward on January 1 of each year, so that the number of shares covered by the Incentive Plan is equal to 15 of our
issued and outstanding common stock. No shares were
issued under the plan during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, there were 3,625,000
shares issued under the plan and 1,375,000 available for issuance under the plan. 

F- 15 

Temporary Equity 

On September 20, 2017, 166,667 shares of common
stock were issued at a value of 15.00 per share to one company in exchange for cash of 2,500,000. Pursuant to the subscription
agreement, and amendments, the investor has the right to require the Company to repurchase the shares for 2.5 million at any time
through September 2020, which was initially December 2017. Accordingly, the amounts received are presented as a temporary equity
as of December 31, 2019 and 2018. In December 2017, the Company negotiated and amended its agreement with the investor to extend
this right through May 15, 2018. As part of this extension, the investor was granted warrants to purchase 170,000 shares of common
stock for an exercise price of 15.00 per share over a five-year term. Because the shares are classified as a temporary equity,
and the investors rights to require repurchase of the shares initially expired in 2017 the Company recorded the fair value of these
warrants were recorded as a discount against the proceeds to be amortized as interest expense through February 2018, the initial
extension date. In March 2018, the Company entered into a third amendment to the subscription agreement, extending the option period
to May 15, 2018. The option was further extended in May and June 2018. As consideration for the extensions, the Company s
parent company, Omega Commercial Finance Corporation, agreed to issue to the investor, 65,000 shares of its Series Z preferred
stock, and the Company agreed to reimburse the investor for 21,894 of legal fees incurred related to the extension. The
Company estimated the fair value of the Series Z preferred stock based on recent sales for cash, and recorded additional discounts
of 184,394, including the accrued legal fees, against the common stock to be amortized into interest expense through the extended
expiration of the option in May 2018. In October 2018, the option period was further extended to November 19, 2018. As
consideration for the extension, the Company agreed to allow the investor to direct the investment of the restricted cash into
one more investment types, such stock, money market accounts or similar investments. The investor was also granted the right
to withdrawal any restricted cash in excess of 2.5 million. In November 2018, the option was further extended to January
12, 2019. In March 2019, the option period was extended to June 2019. In June 2019, the option period was extended to September
27, 2019. In September 2019, the option period was extended to February 2020. In January 2020, the option period was extended to
September 2020. During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company amortized the remaining 1,109,113 of the discount. As of
December 31, 20 2019, the cash was held in an escrow account and the shares are carried at 2,500,000. During the year ended December
31, 2020, the investor exercised its right to require the Company to repurchase the shares for 2.5 million and 2.5 million was
released from escrow and returned to the investor in exchange for the common stock. 

On November 27, 2017,
16,667 shares of 2018 Convertible Preferred stock were issued at a value of 15.00 per share to one entity in exchange for cash
of 250,000. The shares have 350,000 warrants attached, each warrant entitling the holder to one additional share with an exercise
date of up to 5 years from the issuance date of the shares. The preferred stock is mandatorily redeemable 10 years after issuance.
The Company allocated 236,897 the proceeds from the sale of the preferred stock to the warrants, which was recorded as a discount
against the preferred stock and is to be amortized as a deemed dividend through the 10-year redemption date. The balance of the
preferred stock reflected in temporary equity as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, was 86,722 and 63,034, net of unamortized
discount of 163,854 and 187,544. 

During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company issued 20,000
shares of Series 2018 Convertible Preferred Stock to its chief executive officer as compensation for services provided. The
Company estimated the fair value of the shares, based on recent sales for cash, of 300,000, as compensation expense for the year
ended December 31, 2019. 

Common Stock 

During
the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company sold 57,067 shares for gross proceeds of 946,005. In July 2019, the Company agreed

NOTE 9 SUBSEQUENT EVENTS 

Parsons Energy Group, LLC 

On July 30, 2020, Alpha entered into a joint venture transaction with Parsons Energy Group, LLC Parsons with respect to
leasehold mining rights then held by Parsons on approximately 1,200 acres located in Independence, Wisconsin, containing an estimated
1,110 Million Tons of Tier 1 Northern White Fracking Sand. In connection therewith, the mining rights were assigned by Parsons to Legacy
Sand Group, LLC, a newly-organized Florida limited liability company Legacy Sand ), which was formed to exploit the fracking
rights. Contemporaneously therewith, Alpha acquired a nineteen percent (19 limited liability company membership interest in Legacy Sands
(the Interest ), in exchange for the issuance to Parsons of 3,382 shares of Alpha s Series 2020 Preferred Stock (the
 Series 2020 Preferred Shares ). 

Accordingly,
on July 29, 2021, the Company and Parsons entered into an Unwinding Agreement (the Unwinding Agreement ), pursuant to which
the joint venture was unwound. Under the Unwinding Agreement, Parsons returned the Series 2020 Preferred Shares to the Company for cancellation
and the Company assigned the Interest in Legacy Sand back to Parsons and exchanged mutual releases. 

Legacy Sand 

However, despite using its best efforts, pending Legacy Sand commencing operations and generating
revenues, the Company was not been able to sufficiently establish the valuation of the Interest and the Series 2020 Preferred Shares to
the satisfaction of its independent registered public accounting firm, in order to allow the Interest to be reflected as an asset on the
Company s balance sheet included in its periodic reports filed with the SEC under the Securities Act of 1934, as amended. 

Series AA Convertible Preferred Issuance 

As of June 30, 2021, Alpha issued 100,000 Series AA Convertible Preferred Shares to Omega Commercial Finance Corporation which represents
100 of the issued and outstanding Series AA Convertible Preferred Shares. Each share of Series AA Preferred Stock shall entitle the
holder thereof to four hundred fifty (450) votes on all matters submitted to a vote of the stockholders of the Company. Each share of Series
AA Preferred Stock shall be convertible, at the option of the holder thereof, at any time and from time to time, into ten (10) fully
paid and non-assessable shares of Common Stock (the Conversion Amount ). 

Common Stock Shares Retired to Treasury 

As of June 30, 2021 Omega Commercial Finance Corporation and holder of
Common Shares of Alpha retired 31,070,000 of its Common Shares to treasury. Alpha s current issued and outstanding common stock
is 9,724,401.

Item 9A. Controls and Procedures 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

As of December 31, 2020, our Chief Executive Officer
(our principal executive and financial officer) conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure
controls and procedures; as is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of Exchange Act. We recognize that there are material weaknesses related to our
internal controls. Therefore, our Chief Executive Officer has concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective,
as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This includes ensuring that information required to be disclosed
was recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Furthermore, to
provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed is accumulated and communicated as appropriate to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Management s
Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

Our Chief Executive Officer (our principal executive
and financial officer) is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in
Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act. We have designed our internal controls to provide reasonable assurance that our financial
statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (U.S. GAAP), and include those
policies and procedures that: 

pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and disposition of our
assets; 

provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorization
of our management and directors; and 

provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that
could have a material effect on the financial statements. 

Our Chief Executive Officer (our principal executive
and financial officer) conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting as of December 31,
2020. In making this evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations
of the Treadway Commission COSO in its 2013 Internal Control Integrated Framework. 

Based on
this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer has concluded that our internal controls over financial reporting were not effective as
of the end of the period covered in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The Chief Executive Officer has concluded that the financial statements
included in this report fairly present in all material respects our financial position and results of operations. 

This Annual Report does not include an attestation
report of the Company s registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. The Chief Executive
Officer s report was not subject to attestation by the Company s registered public accounting firm pursuant to rules of the
SEC that permit the Company to provide only management s report in this annual report. 

13 

Material Weakness in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

A material weakness is a control deficiency or a combination of control
deficiencies that result in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will
not be prevented or detected. Our Chief Executive Officer has concluded that, as of December 31, 2020, we did not maintain effective controls
over the preparation, review, presentation and disclosure of our financial statements. Specifically, we noted the following. 

the Company did not maintain effective
controls to identify and maintain segregation of duties to support the identification, authorization, approval, accounting for, and the
disclosure of related-party transactions and significant unusual transactions. Specifically, one individual, the CEO, initiates related-party
transactions and non-routine transactions. This CEO also reviews, evaluates, and approves these same transactions. 

the Company does not have accounting
policies and procedures to specify the correct treatment for estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts and bad debt expense of loans
receivable. Specifically, a supporting analysis is not prepared for estimating the allowance for loan losses and bad debt expense. 

the Company s board of directors
does not demonstrate independence from management in exercising oversight of the development and performance of internal control over
financial reporting. Specifically, there is no functioning audit committee or outside directors on the board of directors to exercise
independent oversight over internal control over financial reporting. 

Plan for Remediation of Material Weakness 

We anticipate, contingent on cash funds available, that actions will be
taken to strengthen the Company s internal control over financial reporting and will, over time, address the related material weakness.
However, because many of the controls in the Company s system of internal controls rely extensively on manual review and approval,
the successful operation of these controls may be required for several quarters prior to management being able to conclude that the material
weakness has been remediated. 

Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls 

The effectiveness of any system of internal control over financial reporting,
including ours, is subject to inherent limitations, including the exercise of judgment in designing, implementing, operating and evaluating
the controls and procedures, and the inability to eliminate misconduct completely. Accordingly, any system of internal control over financial
reporting, including ours, no matter how well designed and operated, can only provide reasonable, not absolute assurances. In addition,
projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of
changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. We intend to continue to monitor
and upgrade our internal controls as necessary or appropriate for our business, but cannot assure you that such improvements will be sufficient
to provide us with effective internal control over financial reporting. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There have been no other changes in our internal control over financial
reporting that occurred during our fiscal year ended December 31, 2020 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially
affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.

Narrative Disclosure to the Director Compensation Table 

We currently do not compensate our directors
for their services as such. When we expand our board to include independent directors we intend to implement

Our Incentive Plan provides for equity incentives
to be granted to our employees, executive officers or directors or to key advisers or consultants. Equity incentives
may be in the form of stock options with an exercise price not less than the fair market value of the underlying Shares as determined

agreement, with Partners South Properties Corporation PSPC ), provides for a revolving line of credit in the maximum
principal sum of 5,000,000 for the purpose of financing real property construction costs and working capital needs. The line of
credit is secured by a pledge of all the capital stock of PSPC. The maturity date of the line of credit is August 31, 2022 at which time
the entire then outstanding principal balance plus accrued interest thereon is due and payable. The fixed interest rate on the
line of credit is 3.5 to be paid quarterly on the first day of each calendar quarter. As of September 30, 2020, the loan receivable
balance was 250,000. 

18 

The lines of credit were subsequently amended
to provide that no additional advances would be made under the credit facilities beyond the outstanding loan receivable balances
as of September 30, 2020. 

The Company believes that the terms of the
lines of credit with PSHL and PSPC are comparable to the terms of lines of credit which ALPC would offer to non-affiliated third-party
borrowers. 

Review, Approval and Ratification of Related
Party Transactions 

The Company does not have a policy that expressly
prohibits its directors, officers, principal stockholders or their respective affiliates from engaging for their own account in
business activities of the types conducted by the Company. The Company s code of business conduct and ethics contains a conflict
of interest policy that prohibits its directors and executive officers, or whoever provides services to the Company, from engaging
in any transaction that involves an actual conflict of interest with the Company, provided , however , that
once the Company adds independent directors to its board, any such conflict may by a majority vote of independent directors. 

Item
14. Principal Accounting Fees and Services 

The total fees charged to the Company by Turner,
Stone Company, L.L.P ., for audit services, including quarterly reviews, were 11,000
 for audit-related services were Nil, for tax services were Nil and for other services were Nil during the year ended December
31, 2020. 

The total fees charged to the Company by Assurance
Dimensions, for audit services, including quarterly reviews, were 36,000 for audit-related services were Nil, for tax services
were Nil and for other services were Nil during the year ended December 31, 2019. 

The SEC requires that before our independent
registered public accounting firm is engaged by us to render any auditing or permitted non-audit related service, the engagement
be either: (i) approved by our Audit Committee or (ii) entered into pursuant to pre-approval policies and procedures established
by the Audit Committee, provided that the policies and procedures are detailed as to the particular service, the 
Audit Committee is informed of each service, and such policies and procedures do not include delegation of the Audit Committee s
responsibilities to management. 

We do not have an audit committee. Our
Board pre-approves all services provided by our independent registered public accounting firm. All of the above services and fees
paid during 2020 and 2019 were pre-approved by our Board.
