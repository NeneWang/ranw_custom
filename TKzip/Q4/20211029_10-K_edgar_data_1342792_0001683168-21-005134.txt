PART I 

Item 1. Business. 

We are a science based direct to consumer (DTC)
health company offering products and services focused on aging biology wellness and longevity. Our program is based on the book the Kaufmann
Protocol authored by our co-founder Dr. Sandra Kaufmann, M.D., and on identifying and offering individual specific services,
recommendations and treatments designed to improve our customers lifespan and health-span. Whereas lifespan represents
the total number of years we live, and health-span is how
many of those years we remain healthy, active, energetic and free from disease. Our goal is to use science and technology, current and
emerging treatments to lengthen lifespan and maximize health-span. 

We
operate a DTC sales model, which means we market our products directly to our target consumers. We currently sell our book, the Kaufmann
Protocol online, we offer, the Kaufmann Protocol, a mobile application on the iOS platform, and plan to commercialize and market a line
of products, including our own branded molecular agents, health and wellness testing kits and services, as well as published and multimedia
content. 

Kaufmann Protocol 

In the book The Kaufmann
Protocol, Dr. Kaufmann explores the multifactorial causes of aging and presents strategies where aging is curtailed, these strategies
are hereinafter referred to as the Protocol . 

2 

At the most basic level organisms age
because their component cells age, the Protocol addresses the seven known theories, or the Kaufmann Seven Tenets of cellular
aging into tenets, which are: Information Systems (DNA), Cellular Energy, Cellular Pathways, Quality Control, Immune System, Individual
Cells and Waste Management. 

1. 
 Information Systems (DNA). DNA is our information depot. Issues with aging in this category include epigenetic modification, accumulation of DNA damage, and telomeric integrity. Epigenetic modification encompasses changes to the packaging of the DNA, including methylation, histone modification and the like. Telomeres, the caps or ends of DNA, are known to shorten over time and are broadly correlated to the length of a life. 

2. 
 Cellular Energy. Mitochondria, cellular organelles, serve as our energy source. These organelles are rate limiting over time as their output declines, second to either damage from free radicals or simply declining availability of raw materials. 

3. 
 Cellular Pathways. The pathways are our aging or anti-aging pathways, such as the AMP Kinase, the Sirtuin or the mTOR pathways. These are like enzymatic dominoes that can either direct your cells and tissues to age or not age. 

4. 
 Quality Control. This category includes the DNA and Protein Repair mechanisms, which are key to repairing the ongoing damage inside your cells. As you get older and the damage becomes more extensive, these mechanisms get a bit stressed. This category also includes intracellular autophagy, a mechanism for cellular recycling. 

5. 
 Immune System. The cells that compose the immune system constitute your security system. Over time, unfortunately, this system becomes problematic and causes the body to be in a state of chronic and systemic inflammation. In addition, the failing immune system causes an increase in infection and cancer. 

6. 
 Individual Cells. Depending on the lifespan of particular cells, some live for days while some last a life time, their particular needs can be specialized. Some require an increased pool of nutrients, while others have more issues with trash accumulation. 

7. 
 Waste Management. Every cell has requirements for living, such as oxygen and glucose. Unfortunately, these can lead to increased aging. As an example, glucose forms molecular complexes called Advanced Glycation Endproducts (AGEs), which are very destructive. As well, longer lived cells produce cellular waste, called lipofuscin, that accumulates and eventually causes space issues. 

Our Products 

Based on the Seven Tenets,
the Protocol has identified a series of molecular agents, certain of which are dietary supplements and or prescription medications that
can be used to combat aging and improve health-span. Many of the molecular agents we recommend have been used in eastern medicine for
thousands of years based on their curative effects, and are generally available, none of which are proprietary to us. We do however identify
and present individualized and in certain instances dosage specific individualized recommendations, based on algorithmic outputs of our
software, based on individual biology, diet, lifestyle and desired outcomes. Three generalized, and our most popular regimens are: 

The Panacea; The General Strategy 

The Sweet Tooth; The Anti-Glycation Strategy 

The Ache Remedy; The Anti-Inflammatory Strategy 

We do not currently offer
the molecular agents that makeup our Strategies. Our designed strategies, include a regimen of molecular agents, which currently must
be sourced from third parties, however it is our plan to source and market the products which make up our proprietary strategies under
our own brand, the Kaufmann Protocol, which we plan to offer through our website and mobile
application . 

Our Mobile Application 

The mobile application guides
users through a specific set of questions relating to your age and aging concerns and will use our proprietary algorithm to design a regimen
scientifically calculated to achieve optimum results addressing your needs, based on the users responses. We expect our mobile
and web applications will serve as a sales tool, for initial sales, reorders and as a means to connect with our customers to track their
progress, deliver relevant and meaningful content and serve as a platform for future growth and expansion of our DTC product offerings.

Fitwell App Acquisition 

On May 29, 2021, we entered into a binding letter
of intent (the LOI with Fitwell Limited a company organized under the laws of the United Kingdom Fitwell to acquire Fitwell and its fitness and nutrition app, that same letter of intent expired, pursuant to the terms therein on July 29, 2021.
Subsequent thereto, on September 24, 2021, we entered into a contingent Stock Purchase Agreement (the Agreement with
Fitwell pursuant to which we have agreed to acquire one hundred percent of issued and outstanding shares of Fitwell for a purchase price
of 1,000,000 payable in cash and our common stock. Worldwide Strategies will pay an aggregate cash purchase price of 500,000 and will
issue shares of the Registrant s common stock valued at 500,000 with the price per share being the price that we price our shares
for sale in our planned Regulation A+ offering the Offering ), notwithstanding, the price of the offering, the price per
share of the shares to be issued to Fitwell shall not exceed a per share price of 0.40. The acquisition is contingent on our conducting
a Regulation A+ offering, wherein we raise a minimum of 2,000,000 (the Offering ). The Fitwell shareholders will receive
the cash component of our purchase price from the proceeds of our Offering and the shares to be issued shall be issued subsequent to the
closing of the Offering. In connection with the Buyer s acquisition of the Business, the Buyer and the Seller will enter into customary
transition services and other ancillary arrangements. The Agreement also contains representations, warranties, covenants, indemnification
obligations and closing conditions which are customary for transactions of this nature. The Buyer and the Seller have the right to terminate
the Agreement prior to the closing under certain circumstances, including, without limitation: (i) by mutual written consent; (ii) by
either the Buyer or the Seller if the closing has not occurred on or before the date that is 90 days following the qualification of the
Registrant s offering by the Securities and Exchange Commission; (iii) by the Seller if the Offering does not raise a minimum
of 2,000,000in proceeds or (iv) by either the Buyer or the Seller if a material breach occurs and is not cured within the required
amount of time. 

The Fitwell Personal
Fitness Coach app is an Artificial intelligence AI powered fit-tech mobile application that optimizes health and fitness
through a state of the art mobile app and chatbot. Fitwell has more than 1.9 million registered users globally and been selected Best
of PlayStore and Top Developer by Google; featured among best apps by Apple. The company has been rated as one of
the top start-ups by Early Metrics and was named among top 10 AI companies in Fitness Tech industry to watch in 2018 by Disruptor Daily.
Fitwell has distribution agreements in place with Euro based telcos, and a roster of fitness influencers who generate revenue based on
their content on the platform. 

Fitwell pioneered the fitness creator
monetization model through its Fitwell Personal Fitness Coach App, and assuming we are successful in closing this acquisition, we plan
on further executing on the Fitwell business plan by continuing to recruit and onboard fitness creators and influencers. We also plan
to employ data segmentation of the Fitwell database to offer our aging biology and wellness offerings and to offer fitness and nutrition
content to our Kaufmann Protocol users.

Significant Recent Developments Regarding
COVID-19 

During March 2020, a global
pandemic was declared by the World Health Organization related to the rapidly spreading outbreak of a novel strain of coronavirus designated
COVID-19. The pandemic has significantly impacted economic conditions in the United States. The long-term impact of COVID-19 on the economy
and on our business remains uncertain, the duration and scope of which cannot currently be predicted. Please refer to the matters discussed
under the caption Risk Factors . 

Results of Operations During the Year Ended
July 31, 2021 As Compared to The Year Ended July 31, 2020 

Net Loss 

For the years ended July
31, 2021 and 2020 we incurred net losses of approximately 1.4 million and 48,000 respectively. 

Revenue 

For
the years ended July 31, 2021 and 2020, we generated no revenue. 

Expenses 

For the years ended July
31, 2021 and 2020, we incurred expenses of approximately 1.4 million and 48,000 respectively. The increase of 1.4 million in expenses
for the year ended July 31, 2021 was primarily related to stock compensation expense of approximately 1.3 million and an increase in
professional fees of approximately 12,000. For the years ended July 31, 2021 and 2020 we incurred interest expense of approximately
 48,000 in relation to the promissory notes outstanding. 

7 

Liquidity 

Currently, we rely on our
management to provide us with the capital needed to run our business on a day-to-day basis . 

For the years ended July 31, 2021 and 2020 we incurred net losses of
approximately 1.4 million and 48,000 respectively. As of July 31, 2021 and 2020, we had no cash on hand and current liabilities of 0.9
million. During the year ended July 31, 2021 our CEO and CFO provided loans to us in the amount of 14,577. 

We will seek additional funds through equity or
debt financing, collaborative or other arrangements with corporate partners, licensees or others, and from other sources, which may have
the effect of diluting the holdings of existing shareholders. 

The Company has no current
arrangements with respect to, or sources of, such additional financing and we do not anticipate that existing shareholders will provide
any portion of our future financing requirements. 

No
assurance can be given that additional financing will be available when needed or that such financing will be available on terms acceptable
to the Company. If adequate funds are not available, we may be required to delay or terminate expenditures for certain of its programs
that it would otherwise seek to develop and commercialize. This would have a material adverse effect on the Company. 

Going Concern 

The report of our independent registered public
accounting firm on the financial statements for the years ended July 31, 2021 and 2020, includes an explanatory paragraph relating to
the uncertainty of our ability to continue as a going concern. We have incurred recurring losses, incurred liabilities in excess of assets
over the past year, and have an accumulated deficit of 15.4 million. Based upon current operating levels, we will be required to obtain
additional capital in order to sustain our operations through July 31, 2022. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Use of
Estimates 

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets
and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period.
Actual results could differ from those estimates. 

Fair Value of Financial Instruments 

On August 1, 2012, the Company
adopted ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures . ASC 820 defines fair value, establishes a three-level valuation hierarchy
for disclosures of fair value measurement and enhances disclosure requirements for fair value measures. The three levels are defined as
follows: 

Level 1 inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets. 

Level 2 inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, and inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument. 

Level 3 inputs to valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair measurement. 

8 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

As
of July 31, 2021 and 2020, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K
promulgated under the Securities Act of 1934. 

Contractual Obligations and Commitments 

As
of July 31, 2021 and 2020, we did not have any contractual obligations. 

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative
Disclosures About Market Risk. 

As a smaller reporting company as
defined by Item 10 of Regulation S-K, the Company is not required to provide this information.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING
FIRM 

To the Board of Directors and 

 Shareholders of Worldwide Strategies,
Inc. 

Opinion on the Financial Statements 

We have audited the accompanying balance sheets
of Worldwide Strategies, Inc. (the Company) as of July 31, 2021 and 2020, and the related statements of operations, changes in stockholders 
deficit, and cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended July 31, 2021, and the related notes (collectively referred
to as the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position
of the Company as of July 31, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the two-year
period ended July 31, 2021, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 

Going Concern 

The accompanying financial statements have been
prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 3 to the financial statements, the Company has
suffered net losses from operations in current and prior periods and has an accumulated deficiency, which raises substantial doubt about
its ability to continue as a going concern. Management s plans regarding those matters are discussed in Note 3. The financial statements
do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

Basis for Opinion 

These financial statements are the responsibility
of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our
audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are
required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and
regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We conducted our audits in accordance with the
standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged
to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding
of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s
internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our audits included performing procedures to assess
the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond
to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating
the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

F- 1 

Critical Audit Matters 

The critical audit matter communicated below is
a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the
audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially
challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of this critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on
the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing separate opinions
on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. 

Going Concern 

As discussed in Note 3 to the financial
statements, the Company has a going concern due to lack of revenue and accumulated net losses from operations in the current and prior
periods. 

Auditing management s evaluation
of going concern involves significant judgement given the fact that the Company uses management s estimates of future revenues and
expenses, which are not to be substantiated. 

To evaluate the appropriateness of
the significant doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern, we examined and evaluated the financial information
that was the initial cause of the doubt along with management s plans to mitigate the significant doubt about continuing as a going
concern.

 NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

 FOR THE YEAR ENDED JULY 31, 2020 and 2019 

 (Audited) 

Note 1 Organization and Basis of Presentation 

Organization and Basis of Presentation 

 Worldwide Strategies Incorporated WWSG 
or the Company was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on April 6, 1998 and ceased operations in 2015. The
Company fully impaired all assets since the shutdown of its operations in 2015. On May 7, 2019, the eight judicial District Court of Nevada
appointed Small Cap Compliance, LLC Custodian as custodian for Worldwide Strategies Incorporated., proper notice having
been given to the officers and directors of Worldwide Strategies Incorporated with no opposition. On July 10, 2019, the Company filed
a Certificate of Reinstatement with the state of Nevada. 

The accompanying financial statements are prepared
on the basis of accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America GAAP and have been prepared assuming
the continuation of the Company as a going concern. The Company has not yet established an ongoing source of revenues sufficient to cover
its operating costs and is dependent on debt and equity financing to fund its operations. Management of the Company is making efforts
to raise additional funding until a registration statement relating to an equity funding facility is in effect. While management of the
Company believes that it will be successful in its capital formation and planned operating activities, there can be no assurance that
the Company will be able to raise additional equity capital or be successful in the development and commercialization of the products
it develops or initiates collaboration agreements thereon. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect
the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may
result from the possible inability of the Company to continue as a going concern. 

Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies 

Cash and Cash Equivalents 

 The Company doesn t maintain any bank accounts
and does not have any cash in hand. For day-to-day business activities, the Company depends upon the directors personal accounts. 

For purposes of reporting within the statements
of cash flows, the Company considers all cash on hand, cash accounts not subject to withdrawal restrictions or penalties, and all highly
liquid debt instruments purchased with a maturity of three months or less to be cash and cash equivalents. 

Use of Estimates 

 The preparation of financial
statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the
date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ
from those estimates. 

Loss per Common Share 

 Net loss per common share is computed by
dividing net loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. As a result, diluted loss per common
share is the same as basic loss per common share for the years ended July 31, 2021 and 2020. Excluded from the weighted average
common shares outstanding amount is convertible preferred stock equivalent to 279,323,394 common shares and convertible debt
equivalent to 44,771,429 common shares as the effect of these on the computation of net loss per share would have been
anti-dilutive. 

F- 7 

Income Taxes 

 The Company accounts for income taxes pursuant
to FASB ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes . Under FASB ASC Topic 740, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on
temporary differences between the bases of certain assets and liabilities for income tax and financial reporting purposes. The deferred
tax assets and liabilities are classified according to the financial statement classification of the assets and liabilities generating
the differences. 

The Company maintains a valuation allowance with
respect to deferred tax assets. The Company establishes a valuation allowance based upon the potential likelihood of realizing the deferred
tax asset and taking into consideration the Company s financial position and results of operations for the current period. Future
realization of the deferred tax benefit depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income within the carry-forward period under the
Federal tax laws. 

Changes in circumstances, such as the Company
generating taxable income, could cause a change in judgment about the reliability of the related deferred tax asset. Any change in the
valuation allowance will be included in income in the year of the change in estimate. 

Fair Value of Financial Instruments 

 On August 1, 2012, the Company adopted ASC 820,
 Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures . ASC 820 defines fair value, establishes a three-level valuation hierarchy for disclosures
of fair value measurement and enhances disclosure requirements for fair value measures. The three levels are defined as follows: 

Level 1 inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets. 

Level 2 inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, and inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument. 

Level 3 inputs to valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair measurement. 

The following tables represent our assets and
liabilities by level measured at fair value on a recurring basis at July 31, 2021 and July 31, 2020:

 The Company reviewed all the recently issued,
but not yet effective, accounting pronouncements and we do not believe any of these pronouncements will have a material impact on the
Company.

Note 3 Going
Concern 

For the years ended July 31, 2021 and 2020 we
incurred net losses of approximately 1.4 million and 48,000 respectively. As of July 31, 2021, we had no cash on hand and current liabilities
of 0.9 million. As of July 31, 2020, we had no cash on hand and current liabilities of 0.9 million. These losses combined with our current
liabilities cast significant doubt on the company s ability to operate under the going concern. The Company filed a Registration
Statement which was declared effective on August 20, 2021. The ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the Company generating
profitable operations in the future and/or obtaining the necessary financing to meet its obligations and repay its liabilities arising
from normal business operations when they come due. Management intends to finance operating costs over the next twelve months with loans
from directors and/or private placement of common stock. The failure to achieve the necessary levels of profitability or obtaining additional
funding would be detrimental to the Company. 

Note 4 Related Party Transactions 

The Company s CFO has provided office space
at no cost to the Company. Our CEO and CFO incurred expenses on behalf of the Company amounting to 14,577 during the years ending July

Note 6 Shareholders Equity 

Preferred stock

The relative rights and preferences of these series include preference of dividends, redemption terms and conditions, amount payable upon

 On December 15, 2008 the Company filed a certificate
of designation with the Nevada Secretary of State, in which it was designated and authorized to issue 5,000,000 shares of Convertible
Series A Preferred Stock at a par value of 0.001. Each share of Series A Preferred Stock is convertible into 6.25 shares of common stock
at the election of the holder. Each Series A share is entitled to 6.25 votes in any vote of the common stock holders. Series A shares

founder stock in connection with the reorganization of our business. The Company recorded 1.3 million as stock compensation in relation
to the issuance of the Series A preferred stock based upon the fair value of such shares. 

Series B Preferred Stock

of designation with the Nevada Secretary of State, in which it was designated and authorized to issue 5,000,000 shares of Convertible
Series B Preferred Stock at a par value of 0.001. Each share of Series B Preferred Stock is convertible into 1,000 shares of common stock
at the election of the holder. On July 10, 2019, the Company filed a Certificate of Reinstatement with the state of Nevada and issued
to the Custodian 270,000 shares of Convertible Series B preferred stock to satisfy all outstanding obligations and debts owed to Custodian
for costs associated with the custodianship proceedings, and all expenses incurred by the custodian in reinstating the company under Nevada
state law, and settling all outstanding balances with the company s transfer agent. These shares were valued using the underlying
stock price at the date of issuance which resulted in the Company recording stock compensation expense of 5.4 million.

authorized to issue 975,000,000 and 33,333,333 shares of common stock respectively. On May 26, 2021, the Company increased the authorized
amount of common stock to be issued to 975,000,000. Total shares outstanding at July 31, 2021 and 2020 were 19,830,679, respectively. 

Note 7 Income Taxes 

The Company accounts for income taxes under FASB
ASC Topic 740, which requires use of the liability method. FASB ASC Topic 740 provides that deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded
based on the differences the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes, referred
to as temporary differences. 

As of July 31, 2021, the Company incurred a net
operating loss and, accordingly, no provision for income taxes has been recorded. In addition, no benefit for income taxes has been recorded
due to the uncertainty of the realization of any tax assets. The Company has approximately 5.1 million and 3.7 million of federal net
operating loss carry forwards at July 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. In addition, the Company had gross deferred tax assets of 1.0
million and 0.8 million as of July 31, 2021 and 2020 for which a full valuation allowance has provided. 

Based on the available objective evidence, including
the Company's history of losses, management believes it is more likely than not, the net deferred tax assets will not be fully realizable.
Accordingly, the Company provided for a full valuation allowance against its net deferred tax assets at July 31, 2021 and 2020. The Company
had no uncertain tax positions as of July 31, 2021 and 2020.

Note 8 Subsequent Events 

On May 29, 2021, we entered into a binding letter of intent (the LOI with Fitwell Limited a company organized under the laws of the United Kingdom Fitwell to acquire Fitwell and its fitness
and nutrition app, that same letter of intent expired, pursuant to the terms therein on July 29, 2021. 

Subsequent thereto, on September 24, 2021, we entered into a contingent
Stock Purchase Agreement (the Agreement with Fitwell pursuant to which we have agreed to acquire one hundred percent of
issued and outstanding shares of Fitwell for a purchase price of 1,000,000 payable in cash and our common stock. Worldwide Strategies
will pay an aggregate cash purchase price of 500,000 and will issue shares of the Registrant s common stock valued at 500,000
with the price per share being the price that we price our shares for sale in our planned Regulation A+ offering the Offering ),
notwithstanding, the price of the offering, the price per share of the shares to be issued to Fitwell shall not exceed a per share price
of 0.40. The acquisition is contingent on our conducting a Regulation A+ offering, wherein we raise a minimum of 2,000,000 (the Offering ). 

The Fitwell shareholders will receive the cash component of our purchase
price from the proceeds of our Offering and the shares to be issued shall be issued subsequent to the closing of the Offering. In connection
with the Buyer s acquisition of the Business, the Buyer and the Seller will enter into customary transition services and other
ancillary arrangements. The Agreement also contains representations, warranties, covenants, indemnification obligations and closing conditions
which are customary for transactions of this nature. 

The Buyer and the Seller have the right to
terminate the Agreement prior to the closing under certain circumstances, including, without limitation: (i) by mutual written
consent; (ii) by either the Buyer or the Seller if the closing has not occurred on or before the date that is 90 days following
the qualification of the Registrant s offering by the Securities and Exchange Commission; (iii) by the Seller if the
Offering does not raise a minimum of 2,000,000 in proceeds or (iv) by either the Buyer or the Seller if a material breach
occurs and is not cured within the required amount of time.

Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants
on Accounting and Financial Disclosure. 

None. 

Item 9A. Controls
and Procedures. 

Evaluation of Disclosure
Controls and Procedures 

Under
the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we evaluated
the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as that term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange
Act) as of July 31, 2021, which is the end of the period covered by this Annual Report. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of July
31, 2021 to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is (i)
recorded, processed, summarized, evaluated and reported, as applicable, within the time periods specified in the United States Securities
and Exchange Commission s rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including the
Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. 

Report of Management on Internal Control over
Financial Reporting 

Our management is responsible
for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) promulgated
under the Exchange Act as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, our principal executive officer and principal financial
and accounting officer and effected by our Board of Directors to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP. Because of our inherent limitations, our internal
control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can
provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness
to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

Our management assessed the effectiveness of our
internal control over financial reporting as of July 31, 2021. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth
by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013
Framework). 

Based on our evaluation, management concluded
that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of July 31, 2021 due to a lack of segregation of duties.
A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a
reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected and corrected
on a timely basis. As this deficiency created a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement would not be prevented or detected
in a timely basis, management concluded that the control deficiency represented a material weakness and accordingly our internal control
over financial reporting was not effective as of July 31, 2021. Management concluded that additional personnel should be hired to ensure
that there is adequate segregation of duties. 

Remediation Plan for Material Weakness in Internal
Control over Financial Reporting 

We and our Board treat the controls surrounding,
and the integrity of, our financial statements with the utmost priority. Management is committed to the planning and implementation of
remediation efforts to address control deficiencies and any other identified areas of risk. These remediation efforts are intended to
both address the identified material weakness and to enhance our overall financial control environment. 

10 

We are committed to maintaining a strong internal
control environment. Our remediation efforts have begun, and we will continue to devote significant time and attention to these remedial
efforts. As we continue to evaluate and work to improve our internal control over financial reporting, management may determine to take
additional measures to strengthen controls or to modify the remediation plan described above, which may require additional implementation
time. 

We believe there are no material inaccuracies
or omissions of material fact in this Form 10-K and, to the best of our knowledge, we believe that the financial statements in this Form
10-K fairly present in all material respects our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows in conformity with GAAP. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial
Reporting 

Based on our evaluation, management concluded
that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of July 31, 2021 due to a lack of segregation of duties. 

Other than as set forth in the foregoing paragraph,
there have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended July 31, 2021 that
has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

This annual report does not include an attestation
report of the Company's registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management's
report was not subject to attestation by the Company's registered public accounting firm pursuant to rules of the SEC that permit the
Company to provide only management's report in this annual report.
