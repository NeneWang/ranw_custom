CHASE GENERAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARY 

 ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K 

 FOR THE YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2021 

PART I 

ITEM 1 BUSINESS 

Chase General Corporation was incorporated
November 6, 1944 for the purpose of manufacturing confectionery products. In 1970, Chase General Corporation acquired a 100 interest
in its wholly-owned subsidiary, Dye Candy Company. (Chase General Corporation and Dye Candy Company are sometimes referred herein as the
Company). This subsidiary is the main operating company for the reporting entity. 

Principal Products and Methods
of Distribution 

 The subsidiary, Dye Candy Company,
operates two divisions, Chase Candy Products and Seasonal Candy Products. Chase Candy Products involve production and sale of a candy
bar marketed under the trade name Cherry Mash . The Seasonal Candy Products involve production and sale of coconut, peanut,
chocolate, and fudge confectioneries. The products of both divisions are sold to the same type of customers in the same geographical areas.
In addition, both divisions share a common labor force and utilize the same basic equipment and raw materials. Management considers these
two divisions as one reportable segment for inclusion in this filing. 

The principal products produced are
as follows: 

Chase
Candy Products of Dye Candy Company produces a candy bar under the trade name of Cherry Mash . The bar is distributed
in the following case sizes: 

(1) 60 count pack 

(2) 12 boxes of 24 bars per box 

(3) 200 count shipper box 

(4) 100 count shipper box 

(5) 100 # 2 box Counter Display 

In addition to the regular size bar,

ITEM 1 BUSINESS (CONTINUED) 

Principal Products and Methods
of Distribution (Continued) 

 Seasonal
Candy Products of Dye Candy Company produces coconut, peanut, chocolate, and fudge confectioneries and purchases other outsourced
products. These products are distributed in bulk or packaged. Principal products include: 

(1) Coconut Bon-Bons 
 (6) 
 Peanut Brittle 

(2) Coconut Stacks 
 (7) 
 Peanut Clusters 

(3) Home Style Poe Fudge 
 (8) 
 Champion Cr me Drops 

(4) Peco Flake 
 (9) 
 Jelly Candies 

(5) Peanut Squares 
 (10) 
 Frosted Pretzels 

The Champion Cr me Drops, Frosted
Pretzels, and Jelly Candies are not produced by the Company. 

All products are shipped to customers
by commercial haulers. 

Competition and Market Area 

 The Chase Candy Products division bars
are sold primarily to wholesale candy and tobacco jobbing houses, grocery accounts, vendors, and repackers. Cherry Mash 
bars are marketed in the Midwest region of the United States. For the years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, this division accounted for
63 and 57 , respectively, of the consolidated sales of Dye Candy Company. 

The Seasonal Candy Products division
is sold primarily on a Midwest regional basis to national syndicate accounts, repackers, and grocery accounts. For the years ended June
30, 2021 and 2020, this division accounted for 37 and 43 , respectively of the consolidated sales of Dye Candy Company. 

The Company has no government contracts,
foreign operations or export sales. In addition, all domestic sales are primarily in the Midwest region of the United States. 

The Company is a seasonal business
whereby the largest volume of sales occur in August through December of each year. The earnings per quarter of the Company varies in direct
proportion to the seasonal sales volume. 

Due to the seasonal nature of the business,
there is a heavier demand on working capital in the fall and winter months of the year when the Company is building its inventories in
anticipation of August through December sales. The fluctuation of demand on working capital due to the seasonal nature of the business
is common to the confectionery industry. If necessary, the Company has the ability to borrow short-term funds to finance operations prior
to receiving cash collections from fall sales. The Company occasionally offers extended payment terms of up to sixty days. Since this
practice is infrequent, the effect on working capital is minimal.

 FOR THE YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2021 

ITEM 1 BUSINESS (CONTINUED) 

Competition and Market Area
(Continued) 

 Prompt service and efficient service
are traits demanded in the confectionery industry, which results in a continual low volume of back-orders. Therefore, at no time during
the year does the Company have a significant amount of back-orders. 

The confectionery (candy) market for
the type of product produced by the divisions of Dye Candy Company is very competitive and quality minded. The confectionery industry
in which the divisions operate is highly competitive with many small companies and, within certain specialized areas, a few competitors
dominate. In the United States, the dominant competitors in the coconut candy industry are Crown Candy Company, Vermico Candy Company,
and the Seasonal Candy Products division of Dye Candy Company with approximately 70 of the market share among them. In the United States,
Old Dominion has approximately 80 of the market share of the peanut candy business in which the Seasonal Candy Products division operates.
Dye Candy Company sells approximately 95 of its products in the Midwest region with seasonal orders being shipped to the Southern and
Eastern regions of the United States. Except for the coconut candy industry, Dye Candy Company is not a dominant competitor in any of
the candy industries in which it competes. Dye Candy Company s market share in the coconut industry does not vary significantly
from year to year. 

Principal methods of competition the
Company uses include quality of product, price, reduced transportation costs due to central location, and service. The Company s
competitive position is positively influenced by labor costs being lower than industry average. Chase General Corporation is firmly established
in the confectionery market and through its operating divisions has many years of experience associated with its name. 

Research and Development 

 The Company has not developed any new
products for the years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020. 

Raw Materials and Principal
Suppliers 

 Raw materials and packaging materials
are produced on a national basis with products coming from locations throughout the United States. Raw materials and packaging materials
are generally widely available, depending on common market influences. No suppliers accounted for more than 10 of the Company s
cost of sales for the years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020. 

Patents and Trademarks 

 The largest single revenue producing
product, the Cherry Mash bar, is protected by a trademark registered with The United States Patent and Trademark Office.
The Company considers this trademark significant to operations. This trademark expires in the year 2023. The Company and its legal representatives
do not expect any impediment to renewing this trademark prior to its expiration.

Employees 

 As of June 30, 2021, the Company had
19 full time employees. This expands to approximately 30 full time personnel during the busy production months of August through December. 

Customers 

 For the years ended June 30, 2021 and
2020, one customer accounted for 41 and 45 , respectively, of sales. As of June 30, 2021 and 2020, that same customer accounted for 24 
and 14 , respectively, of trade receivables. For the years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, another customer and its affiliates accounted
for 8 , respectively, of sales. As of June 30, 2021 and 2020, that same customer and its affiliates accounted for 28 and 23 , respectively,
of trade receivables. No other customer accounted for more than 10 of the Company s sales for the years ended June 30, 2021 and
2020. No other customers accounted for more than 10 of the Company s trade receivables for the years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020. 

Environmental Protection and
the Effect on Probable Government Regulations on the Business 

 To
the best of management s knowledge, the Company is presently in compliance with all environmental laws and regulations and does
not anticipate any future expenditures in this regard. The Company has evaluated the requirements
of the Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA). The FSMA aims to ensure the U.S. food supply is safe by shifting the focus of federal regulators
from responding to contamination to preventing it. The FSMA has given the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) new authorities to regulate
the way foods are grown, harvested, and processed. As of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021 and through
the filing of this form, management believes the Company is compliant with all FSMA requirements. Another inspection for compliance will
be conducted by a third-party within 12 months of year-end. Management does not anticipate any future significant expenditures in the
next twelve months in this regard. 

Need for Government Approval
of Principal Products or Services 

 The
Company is required to meet the Food and Drug Administration guidelines for proper labeling of its products and for contents of its products.
 Management does not anticipate any future significant expenditures in the next twelve months in
this regard.

 The Registrant is not required to send
the annual audit report, annual 10-K report and quarterly 10-Q reports to security holders since the stock is not actively traded. These

Forward-Looking Statements 

 This
report contains statements that plan for or anticipate the future. Forward-looking statements may include statements about the future
of our products and the industry, statements about our future business plans and strategies, and other statements that are not historical
in nature. In this report, forward-looking statements are generally identified by the words estimate, project, 
 anticipate, expect, intend, believe, and the like. Readers should carefully
review these cautionary statements as they identify certain important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from
those in the forward-looking statements and from historical trends, including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. These forward-looking
statements are based on the information available to, and the expectations and assumptions deemed reasonable by, the Company at the time
the statements are made. These expectations, assumptions, and uncertainties include: the Company s expectation of heavier demand
on working capital in the fall and winter months in anticipation of August through December sales; our belief that the Company has stabilized
its customer base; will continue its efforts to expand the existing market area and increase sales to customers; and maintain tight control
of all expenditures.

fiscal year ended June 30, 2021, the Company s sales were 2,960,357, as compared to sales of 2,576,311 for fiscal year
ended June 30, 2020. The 14.9 increase in volume, 1.5 decrease in cost of sales and 10.5 increase in operating expenses resulted in
a change in profitability during the year, as reflected in the income from operations of 186,160 for fiscal year 2021 compared to the
loss from operations of 144,491 for fiscal year 2020. Working capital increased 279,057 to 568,676 for the fiscal year 2021 from 289,619
for the fiscal year 2020 due primarily to an increase in inventory and accounts receivable.

Critical Accounting Policies
and Estimates 

General 

 Management s discussion and analysis
of financial condition and results of operations are based upon the Company s consolidated financial statements, which have been
prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP). The preparation of these
consolidated financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities,
revenues, and expenses. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to
be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and
liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions
or conditions. 

The Company believes the following critical
accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements. 

There have been no other events that have
occurred subsequent to June 30, 2021, through the date of filing this form, that would require disclosure in the Form 10-K or would be
required to be recognized in the consolidated financial statements as of or for the year ended June 30, 2021. 

Revenue Recognition 

 The Company recognizes revenues as product
is shipped to customers. Sales are comprised of the total sales billed during the period, including shipping and handling charges to the
customer, less the estimated returns, customer allowances, and customer discounts.

Inventories 

 Inventories are carried at the lower
of cost or net realizable value, with cost being determined on the first-in, first-out basis of accounting. The cost
of goods in process include an estimate for manufacturing overhead. Finished goods inventory are valued using the lower of cost or market
value, determined by the retail inventory method. Under the retail inventory method, the valuation of finished goods inventory at cost
and the resulting gross margins are calculated by applying a cost-to-retail ratio to the retail value of inventories.

Fiscal Year 2021 Compared to
Fiscal Year 2020 

Sales 

 During the year ended June 30, 2021, sales,
net of returns and allowances, increased 384,046 or 14.9 as compared to the year ended June 30, 2020. Sales for Chase Candy products
increased 388,613 or 26.3 to 1,868,899 for the year ended June 30, 2021 compared to 1,480,286
for the year ended June 30, 2020. Sales for Seasonal Candy products decreased 4,567 or .4 to 1,091,458 for the year ended June 30,
2021 as compared to 1,096,025 for the year ended June 30, 2020. 

Sales for Chase Candy consisted of the
following divisions: L276 Cherry Mash Distributor Pack division, Cherry Mash Merchandisers division, L260 Changemaker Jar division, L279/L299
Bulk Mini Mash division, and L278/L212 Mini Mash division. The 14.9 increase in sales of Chase Candy of 388,613 for the year ended June 30,
2021 over the same period ended June 30, 2020, is primarily due to the following: 1) increased sales of Cherry Mash Merchandisers
division by approximately 49,000 versus the same period a year ago, primarily due to an increase in orders from existing customers, 2)
increased sales of the L278/L212 Mini Mash division by approximately 71,000 versus the same period a year ago, primarily due to an increase
in orders from existing customers, 3) increased sales of the L276 Cherry Mash Distributor Pack division by approximately 257,000 versus
the same period a year ago, primarily due to an increase in orders from existing customers, 4) increased sales of the Cherry Mash internet
sales via the Company s website by approximately 26,000 versus the same period a year ago, primarily due to an increase in orders
from existing customers; offset by 5) decreased sales of the L279/L299 Bulk Mini Mash division by approximately 12,000 versus the same
period a year ago, primarily due to a decrease in orders from existing customers and 6) an increase in promotions expenses allocated to
the Chase Candy division of approximately 6,000 primarily due to selling more items with higher promotion fees associated with them. 

Sales
for Seasonal Candy consisted of the following divisions: bulk seasonal division, clamshell seasonal division, and the generic seasonal
division. The .4 decrease in sales of Seasonal Candy of 4,567 for the year ended June 30, 2021 over the same period ended June 30, 2020,
 is primarily due to the net effect of the following: 1) decreased sales in the Chase clamshell seasonal division by approximately
 17,000 versus the same period a year ago, primarily due to decreased orders from existing customers 2) decreased sales in the bulk seasonal
division by approximately 28,000 versus the same period a year ago, primarily due to decreased orders from existing customers, offset
by 3) increased sales in the generic seasonal division by approximately 30,000 due to increased orders from existing customers and 4)
decrease in sales allowances and discounts taken by customers of approximately 10,000.

to 1,940,111 or 75.3 of sales for the year ended June 30, 2020. 

The 1.5 decrease in cost of sales of
 28,414 is primarily due to adverse effect the COVID-19 pandemic had on the cost of sales for the fourth quarter of fiscal year ended
June 30, 2020. Cost of sales for the fourth quarter ended June 30, 2020 increased 35 or 84,787 due to the costs associated with repurposing
of finished goods inventory to adequately fill customer orders and realignment of staff during a period of decreased production. This
cost was not applicable to the year ended June 30, 2021. 

Labor costs, including wages, vacation
pay and payroll taxes of 672,879 for the year ended June 30, 2021, increased 7.8 or 48,827 as compared to 624,052 for the year ended
June 30, 2020 primarily due to increased production wages due to increased hours, bonuses, and pay rates compared to the same period ended
June 30, 2020. 

Freight expense, including shipping and
handling costs on goods shipped of 115,587 for the year ended June 30, 2021, decreased 18.7 or 26,633 as compared to 142,220 for the
year ended June 30, 2020 due primarily to changing carriers during the fiscal year. 

Gross Profit on Sales 

 The gross profit increased 64.8 or 412,460
to 1,048,660 increasing to 35.4 of related sales for the year ended June 30, 2021, as compared to 636,200 or 24.7 of related sales
for the year ended June 30, 2020, as a net result of the 1.5 decrease in cost of sales described above, the 14.9 increase in sales and
a price increase that was effective in early 2021. 

Finished goods inventory as of June 30,
2021 of 287,245 increased 201,613 or 235.44 from the June 30, 2020 finished goods inventory of 85,632. Raw materials inventory as
of June 30, 2021 of 97,324 increased 31,769 or 48.5 from the June 30, 2020 raw materials inventory of 65,555. Packaging materials
inventory as of June 30, 2021 of 224,318 increased 68,280 or 43.8 from June 30, 2020 packaging materials inventory of 156,038. Goods
in process inventory as of June 30, 2021 of 11,254 increased 4,993 or 79.8 from the June 30, 2020 goods in process inventory of 6,261.
Inventory levels vary based primarily on sales and purchases.

Fiscal Year 2021 Compared to
Fiscal Year 2020 (Continued) 

Selling Expenses 

 Selling expenses for the year ended June
30, 2021 increased 20,831 to 320,775, which is 10.8 of sales, compared to 299,944 or 11.6 of sales for the year June 30, 2020.
This increase is primarily due to higher commissions, and shipping costs. Commission expense increased 17,560 to 119,288 for the year
ended June 30, 2021, as compared to 101,278 for the year ended June 30, 2020 primarily due to an increase in sales of items where
the Company pays commissions. Shipping costs associated with selling expenses increased 14,771 to 47,425 for the year ended June 30,
2021, as compared to 32,654 for the year ended June 30, 2020 primarily due to an increase in orders placed. The above increases were
offset by a decrease in depreciation expense of 12,554 for the year ended June 30, 2021. 

General and Administrative Expenses 

 General and administrative expenses for
the year ended June 30, 2021 increased 60,978 to 541,725, which is 18.3 of sales, compared to 480,747 or 18.7 of sales for the year
ended June 30, 2020. The increase is primarily due to higher professional fees and insurance expense. Professional fees increased 44,739
to 200,741 for the year ended June 30, 2021, as compared to 156,002 for the year ended June 30, 2020 primarily due to increased audit
and consulting fees. Insurance expense increased 15,181 to 146,161 for the year ended June 30, 2021, as compared to 130,980 for the
year ended June 30, 2020 primarily due to the increase in insurance premiums. 

Income (Loss) from Operations 

 Income from operations for the year ended
June 30, 2021 was 6.3 of sales, as compared to a loss from operations which was (5.6) of sales for the year ended June 30, 2020,
for the reasons previously described. 

Other Income (Expense) 

 Other
income reflects a net of income of 177,573 for the year ended June 30, 2021 , as compared
to a net of expense of (1,558) for the year ended June 30, 2020 . This increase of
 179,131 in other income was primarily due to the gain on extinguishment of debt related to the Paycheck Protection Program Promissory
Note. 

Income (Loss) before Income Taxes 

 Income before income taxes was 363,733
for the year ended June 30, 2021, as compared to a loss before income taxes of 146,049 for the year ended June 30, 2020. The reasons
for the increase of 509,782 have been previously discussed.

 The Company recorded no income tax benefit
for the years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020. Additionally, the Company has placed a valuation allowance
on the net deferred tax asset of 25,400 for the current year after it was determined that the Company would not be likely to use the
remaining balance in the near future.

 Net income for the year ended June 30,
2021 was 363,733, compared to a net loss for the year ended June 30, 2020 of (146,049). This increase of 509,782 is the result of those

Operating Activities 

 The
negative cash flow of 134,716 generated from operations is a result of increases in inventory, increases in trade receivables and the
gain on extinguishment of the PPP loan of 171,500. Total inventory as of June 30, 2021 of 620,141 increased 306,655 or 97.8 from
the June 30, 2020 total inventory of 313,486. Trade receivables as of June 30, 2021 of 192,945 increased 48,706 or 33.7 from the June
30, 2020 trade receivables of 144,239. These reductions in cash flow were offset by the net income amount of 363,733 for the year ended
June 30, 2021. The increase in inventory and the gain on extinguishment of debt had the most impact on the negative cash flow from operations. 

Investing Activities 

 The
negative cash flow of 15,880 from investing is a result of equipment purchases made during the year ended June 30, 2021.

Item 7 MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION

Fiscal Year 2021 Compared to
Fiscal Year 2020 (Continued) 

Financing Activities 

 The Company borrowed 395,000 and 227,000,
respectively, on its line-of-credit during fiscal 2021 and the fall of 2019 (fiscal 2020) busy seasons. Payments of 275,000 and 312,000,
respectively, were paid for years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020. The Company entered into a 350,000 line-of-credit agreement expiring
on January 4, 2022, with a variable interest rate at prime but not less than 5 . The line-of-credit
is collateralized by substantially all assets of the Company. Management anticipates renewal of the line-of-credit agreement at similar
terms upon expiration. 

Notes payable principal payments were
 15,679 and 12,132 for years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. 

The Company received a loan in the
amount of 171,500 during the year ended June 30, 2020 to fund payroll, rent, utilities and interest on mortgages and existing debt through
the federal Paycheck Protection Program (PPP). The PPP note has a 1.00 per annum interest rate and is subject to terms and conditions
applicable to loans administered by the SBA under the CARES act, as amended by the PPP Flexibility Act. Monthly principal and interest
payments, less the amount of any potential forgiveness (as discussed below) will commence on November 10, 2020. This loan was fully forgiven
during December 2020. A gain on extinguishment of debt has been recognized as other income. 

Overall cash and cash equivalents decreased
 46,275 to 7,115 at June 30, 2021 from 53,390 at June 30, 2020. 

At June 30, 2021, the Company s
accumulated deficit was 5,705,366, compared to an accumulated deficit of 6,069,099 as of June 30, 2020. Working capital as of June 30,
2021 increased 279,057 to 568,676 from 289,619 as of June 30, 2020. 

The Company s lease on its office
and plant facility is effective through March 31, 2025, with an option to extend for an additional term of five years, and currently
requires payments of 6,500 per month. At the end of each five year period, the base rent may be increased an amount not greater than
30 , at the sole discretion of lessor. The facility is leased from an entity that is partially owned by the son of the Chief Executive
Officer of the Company. 

In
order to maintain funds to finance operations and meet debt obligations, it is the intention of management to continue its efforts to
expand the present market area and increase sales to its customers. Management also intends to continue tight control on all expenditures.
 Due to volatility in the regions where these raw materials are grown, management anticipates the prices of these raw materials
to continue to fluctuate primarily based on supply and demand. Primarily due to the fluctuations in these raw material prices, gross margins
have decreased due to unchanged sales prices during the period. Management intends to make sales price adjustments in the future to correspond
with changes in raw material prices.

To the Board of Directors 

 Chase General Corporation and Subsidiary 

Opinion on the Financial Statements 

We have audited the accompanying
consolidated balance sheets of Chase General Corporation and Subsidiary Company as of June 30, 2021 and 2020, and the
related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the years then ended and the related
notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements ). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of June 30, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash
flows for each of the two years in the period ended June 30, 2021, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America. 

Basis for Opinion 

These consolidated financial statements
are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s consolidated
financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal
securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We conducted our audits in accordance
with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to
have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required
to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness
of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our audits included performing procedures
to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures
that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the
consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide
a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

Critical Audit Matters 

Critical audit matters are matters
arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to
the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2)
involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. We determined that there are no critical audit matters.

NOTE
 1 NATURE OF BUSINESS AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 

Nature of Business 

Chase
 General Corporation (the Company) was incorporated on November 6, 1944 in the state of Missouri
 for the purpose of manufacturing confectionery products. The Company grants credit terms
 to substantially all customers, consisting of repackers, grocery accounts, and national syndicate
 accounts, who are primarily located in the Midwest region of the United States. 

Significant
 accounting policies are as follows: 

Principles of Consolidation 

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Dye Candy Company. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. 

Segment Reporting of the Business 

The subsidiary, Dye Candy Company, operates two divisions, Chase
Candy Products and Seasonal Candy Products. Chase Candy Products involve production and sale of a candy bar marketed under the trade
name Cherry Mash . The Seasonal Candy Products involve production and sale of coconut, peanut, chocolate, and fudge confectioneries.
The products of both divisions are sold to the same type of customers in the same geographical areas. In addition, both divisions share
a common labor force and utilize the same basic equipment and raw materials. Management considers these two divisions as one reportable
segment in these consolidated financial statements. 

Use of Estimates 

The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated
financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from
those estimates. 

Cash and Cash Equivalents 

The Company considers all liquid investments with a maturity
of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents.

Shipping and Handling Costs 

Shipping
and handling costs for freight expense on goods shipped are included in cost of sales. Freight expense on goods shipped for the years
ended June 30, 2021 and 2020 was 115,587 and 142,220, respectively. 

Trade Receivables 

Trade receivables are uncollateralized customer obligations
which generally require payment within thirty days from the invoice date. Trade receivables are stated at the invoice amount as no interest
is charged to the customer for any past due amounts. Payments of trade receivables are applied to the specific invoices identified on
the customer s remittance advice or, if unspecified, to the earliest unpaid invoices. 

The carrying amount of trade receivables is reduced by a valuation
allowance that reflects management s best estimate of amounts that will not be collected. The allowance for doubtful accounts is
based on management s assessment of the collectability of specific customer accounts and the aging of the trade receivables. If
there is a deterioration of a major customer s credit worthiness or actual defaults are higher than the historical experience,
management s estimates of the recoverability of amounts due to the Company could be adversely affected. All accounts or portions
thereof deemed to be uncollectible, or that require an excessive collection cost, are written off to the allowance for doubtful accounts. 

Inventories 

Finished good, raw material and packaging material inventories
are carried at the lower of cost or net realizable value, with cost being determined on the first-in, first-out 
basis of accounting. The cost of goods in process include an estimate for manufacturing overhead. Finished goods inventory are valued
using the lower of cost or market value, determined by the retail inventory method. Under the retail inventory method, the valuation
of finished goods inventory at cost and the resulting gross margins are calculated by applying a cost-to-retail ratio to the retail value
of inventories. 

Property and Equipment 

The Company s property and equipment is recorded at cost
and is being depreciated on straight-line and accelerated methods over the following estimated useful lives: 

Buildings 
 39 years 

Machinery and equipment 
 5 7 years 

Trucks and autos 
 5 years 

Office equipment

NOTE 1 NATURE OF BUSINESS AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED) 

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets 

Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events
or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held
and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset.
If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount
of the assets exceed the fair value of the assets. 

Notes Payable 

The Small Business Administration Paycheck Protection Program
Promissory Note further discussed in Note 3 is being accounted for under Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 470, Debt. Under ASC
470, the initial recognition of the debt is a financial liability that accrues interest. Under ASC 470, derecognition of the liability
will occur when the Company has been legally released or pays off the loan at which time forgiveness will be recorded as
a gain on extinguishment. 

Income Taxes 

Deferred income taxes are provided using the liability method for temporary differences between
 financial statement and income tax reporting. Temporary differences are differences between the amounts of assets and liabilities
 reported for financial statement purposes and their tax bases. Deferred income tax assets are recognized for temporary differences
 that will be deductible in future years tax returns and for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred income tax
 assets are only recognized if it is more likely than not that a tax position will be realized or sustained upon examination by the
 relevant taxing authority. Deferred income tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is
 more likely than not that some or all of the deferred income tax assets will not be realized. A tax position that meets the
 more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is initially and subsequently measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that has a
 greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of relevant
 information. Deferred income tax liabilities are recognized for temporary differences that will be taxable in future years 
 tax returns. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the dates
 of enactment. Based on the facts, the Company has determined it necessary to reduce their deferred income tax asset with a valuation
 allowance due to it being more likely than not that the Company will be able to realize all of the deferred income tax asset. 

The Company s policy is to evaluate uncertain tax positions
under the guidance as prescribed by Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 740, Income Taxes . As of June 30, 2021 and 2020, the
Company has not identified any uncertain tax positions requiring recognition in the consolidated financial statements. The Company had
no accruals for interest or penalties as of June 30, 2021 and 2020.

Earnings Per Common Share 

 Basic earnings per common share is
computed by dividing income available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period.
Diluted earnings per common share shall be computed by including contingently issuable shares with the weighted average shares outstanding
during the period. When inclusion of the contingently issuable shares would have an antidilutive effect upon earnings per share, diluted
earnings per share will be calculated in the same manner as basic earnings per share. 

The following table details out the
contingently issuable shares for the years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020. For 2020, the contingently issuable shares were not included
in diluted earnings per common share as they would have an antidilutive effect upon earnings per share.

Advertising expense was 18,011 and 19,019 for the years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. 

Going Concern 

 The Company follows ASU No. 2014-15,
 Presentation of Financial Statements Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40) . ASU 2014-15 provides guidance related to management s
responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an entity s ability to continue as a going concern and to provide
related footnote disclosure for the years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020. Management determined that, when considered in the aggregate,
the current conditions and events, including the COVID-19 pandemic impact, do not raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability
to continue as a going concern for at least one year after the date the consolidated financial statements are available for issuance.

 NATURE OF BUSINESS AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING

Revenue Recognition 

 The majority of our revenue is derived
by fulfilling customer orders for the purchase of our products, including 1) a candy bar marketed under the trade name Cherry Mash and
2) coconut, peanut, chocolate, and fudge confectioneries. The Company recognizes revenue at the point in time that control of the ordered
product(s) is transferred to the customer, which is typically upon shipment to the customer. Shipping and handling costs incurred to
ship product to the customer are recorded within cost of sales. Amounts billed and due from our customers are classified as accounts
receivables on the balance sheet and require payment on a short-term basis. Generally, individual orders from customers are accounted
for as a single performance obligation. 

Revenue
is measured as the amount of consideration we expect to receive in exchange for fulfilling product orders. Sales, value add, and other
taxes we collect concurrent with revenue-producing activities are excluded from revenue. The amount of consideration the Company expects
to receive and revenue the Company recognizes includes estimates of variable consideration, including costs for trade promotional programs,
customer incentives, and allowances and discounts associated with aged or potentially unsaleable products. These estimates are based upon
our analysis of the programs offered, historical trends, and expectations regarding customer and consumer participation, sales and payment
trends and our experience with payment patterns associated with similar programs offered in the past. The Company reviews and updates
these estimates regularly and the impact of any adjustments are recognized in the period the adjustments are identified. The adjustments
recognized for the year ended June 30, 2021 and 2020 resulting from updated estimates of revenue for prior year product sales were not
significant. The Company has elected a practical expedient to recognize incremental costs incurred to obtain contracts, which primarily
represent sales commissions where the amortization period would be less than one year, as a selling expense when incurred in the financial
statements 

The majority of the Company s
products are confectionery and confectionery-based and, therefore, exhibit similar economic characteristics, such that they are based
on similar ingredients and are marketed and sold through the same channels to the same customers. The Company operates two divisions,
Chase Candy Products and Seasonal Candy Products. Chase Candy Products involve production and sale of a candy bar marketed under the trade
name Cherry Mash . The Seasonal Candy Products involve production and sale of coconut, peanut, chocolate, and fudge confectioneries.
Both divisions share a common labor force and utilize the same basic equipment and raw materials. Management considers these two divisions
as one reportable segment. The various divisions of revenue are as follows: 

2021 
 2020 
 
 Sales - Chase Candy 
 1,868,899

Recently Adopted Pronouncements

The
Company adopted the guidance of ASU No. 2016-02, Leases, (ASC 842) as of July 1, 2019 using the modified retrospective transition
approach with the cumulative effect recognized at the date of initial application. The new standard establishes a right-of-use model (ROU)
that requires a lessee to recognize a ROU asset and lease liability on the balance sheet for all, and disclose key leasing information.
The Company elected a package of practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance, which among other things, allows us to
carryforward the historical lease classification, and exclude from balance sheet reporting those leases with initial terms of 12 months
or less. Leases are classified as finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern and classification of expense recognition
in the income statement. Adoption of the new standard on July 1, 2019 resulted in the recording of operating lease ROU assets and lease
liabilities in the amount of 376,105. The standard did not materially affect the Company s consolidated net income or cash flows.
See Note 8 Commitments, Contingencies, and Related Party Transactions for the required disclosures of the nature, amount,
timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. 

Recently Issued Pronouncements 

 There have been no newly issued or
newly applicable accounting pronouncements that have, or are expected to have, a significant impact on the Company s consolidated
financial statements. 

NOTE 2 FORGIVABLE LOAN AND DEFERRED INCOME 

During 2004, the Company received a
 25,000 economic development incentive from Buchanan County, which is a five-year forgivable loan at a rate of 5,000 per year. The Nodaway
Valley Bank established an Irrevocable Standby Letter of Credit in the amount of 25,000 as collateral for this loan, with a maturity
date of January 3, 2010. The Company met the criteria of occupying a 20,000 square foot building and creating a minimum of two new full-time
equivalent jobs during the first year of operation in the new facility. In addition, the Company maintained 19 existing jobs during the
five-year term. Notice was received February 6, 2009 from the Buchanan County Commission, that the Company had fulfilled its minimum loan
requirements so that the loan was forgiven in full and has no further obligations. Since the Company was no longer legally required to
return the monies, the liability was reclassified as deferred revenue and amortized into income over the life of the lease term of the
new facility. Deferred revenue is recognized on a straight line basis over the lease term of 20 years. During the years ended June 30,
2021 and 2020, deferred revenue of 1,299 was amortized into income.

 COMMITMENTS, CONTINGENCIES AND RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS 

The Company leases its office and manufacturing
facility, located at 1307 South 59th, St. Joseph, Missouri under an operating lease from an entity that is partially owned by the son
of the Chief Executive Officer of the Company. The lease term is from February 1, 2005 through March 31, 2025 with an option to extend
for an additional term of five years. The Company does not believe that exercise of the renewal option is reasonably assured, and has
not included the additional five years in the lease term. The lease currently requires payments of 6,500 per month. 

Operating lease right-of-use assets
and lease liabilities were recognized upon adoption of the lease standard based on the present value of minimum lease payments over the
remaining lease term. The Company s operating lease has a remaining term of 5.5 years and the present value of the lease payments
is calculated using the lessor s implicit rate of 6.43 . Operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the
lease term. 

The Company s lease agreement
does not contain any residual value guarantees. Additionally, any other short-term leases are immaterial. The Company elected the practical
expedient to not separate lease and nonlease components and also elected the short-term practical expedient for all leases that qualify.
As a result, the Company will not recognize right-of-use assets or liabilities for short-term leases that qualify for the short-term practical
expedient, but instead will recognize the lease payments as lease cost on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Operating lease expenses
and cash paid for operating lease liabilities were 78,000 for the year ended June 30, 2021, of which, 71,565 is included in cost of
sales and 6,435 is included in general and administrative expenses. 

Minimum annual payments required under
existing operating lease liabilities that have initial or remaining noncancelable terms in excess of one year as of June 30, 2021 are
as follows:

 DISCLOSURES ABOUT FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 

The Company s financial instruments
consist principally of cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables and payables, and notes payable. There are no significant differences
between the carrying value and fair value of any of these consolidated financial instruments. As of June 30, 2021, the amount of the
Company s long-term debt approximates fair value based on the present value of estimated future cash flows using a discount rate
commensurate with a borrowing rate available to the Company. 

NOTE 10 
 CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK 

For the years ended June 30, 2021 and
2020, two customers accounted for 49 and 53 , respectively, of the sales. As of June 30, 2021 and 2020, two customers accounted for 52 
and 36 , respectively, of trade receivables. The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic are further discussed below in Note 11 . After
considering the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company does not anticipate significant changes to the concentration of credit risk
in the next 12 months. 

NOTE 11 
 SUBSEQUENT EVENTS 

The COVID-19 pandemic is having significant
effects on global markets, supply chains, businesses, and communities. The Company put preparedness plans in place at the manufacturing
facility. They have adjusted the number of people allowed at their facilities, enforced social distancing, maintained proper sanitation
protocol and have asked that any high risk or employees feeling ill to not come in. The office and sales staff continues to work, while
adhering to social distancing guidelines, implementing flexible hours, reducing person-to-person interaction and increasing safety measures. 

To date, there has been minimal disruption
to the supply chain network, including the supply of ingredients, packaging or other sourced materials, though it is possible that more
disruptions could occur if the COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact markets around the world. The Company has repackaged inventory to
continue to fill orders as needed and repurposed employees to better meet the current needs. Cost measures have been put in place to limit
any nonessential needs. 

The Company believes they have sufficient
liquidity to satisfy current cash needs, however, they continue to evaluate and take action, as necessary, to preserve adequate liquidity
and ensure that the business can continue to operate during these uncertain times. 

The potential impact to the Company s
consolidated financial statements could occur as early as the first quarter of fiscal year ending June 30, 2022 and include, but not limited
to: impairment of long lived assets; including property and equipment and operating lease right-of-use assets related to the Company s
fair value and collectability of receivables and other financial assets.

Item 9 CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE 

Not applicable 

Item 9A CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

The Company s principal
executive officer, who is also the chief financial and accounting officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the Company s
disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on such evaluation, such officer has
concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures are not effective as a result of a weakness in the design of
internal control over financial reporting identified below. 

Disclosure controls and procedures include controls and procedures
designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be
disclosed in periodic filings under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to Management, including those officers, and to
members of the board of directors, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Management s Report on
Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

The Company s management is responsible
for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act.
Management has assessed the Company s internal control over financial reporting in relation to criteria described in Internal
Control-Integrated Framework (2013) , issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based
on this assessment using those criteria, management concluded that, as of June 30, 2021, the Company s internal control over financial
reporting was not effective. 

A material weakness was identified in our internal control over financial
reporting due to a lack of accounting personnel with the appropriate level of knowledge, experience and training to perform an assessment
of its internal controls. This has also resulted in a failure to maintain appropriate segregation of duties over system access. Management
believes that this material weakness did not have an adverse effect on the Company s financial results reported herein. We believe
that this material weakness can be remedied or mitigated through further use of our outside, independent financial consultant. 

This Annual Report does not include
an attestation report of the Company s independent registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting.
Management s report was not subject to attestation by the Company s independent registered public accounting firm pursuant
to the temporary rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission that permit the Company to provide only management s report in
this Annual Report.
