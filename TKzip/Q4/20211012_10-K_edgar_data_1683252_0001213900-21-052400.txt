Special
Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements 

This
Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements, within the meaning of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the Securities
Act of 1933 that involve risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements convey our current expectations or forecasts of future events.
All statements contained in this Annual Report other than statements of historical fact are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking
statements include statements regarding our future financial position, business strategy, budgets, projected costs, plans and objectives
of management for future operations. The words may, continue, estimate, intend, plan, 
 will, believe, project, expect, seek, anticipate, should, 
 could, would, potential, or the negative of those terms and similar expressions may identify forward-looking
statements, but the absence of these words does not necessarily mean that a statement is not forward-looking. You should not place undue
reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this report. All of these forward-looking statements
are based on information available to us at this time, and we assume no obligation to update any of these statements. Actual results
could differ from those projected in these forward-looking statements as a result of many factors, including those identified in Business, 
 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and elsewhere. We urge you to review
and consider the various disclosures made by us in this report, and those detailed from time to time in our filings with the Securities
and Exchange Commission, that attempt to advise you of the risks and factors that may affect our future results. Factors that could cause
actual results to differ materially include, among others, our ability to make good decisions about the deployment of capital, our substantial
capital requirements and absence of liquidity, competition, our inability to obtain maximum value for our holdings, our ability to attract
and retain qualified employees, our ability to execute our strategy, market valuations in sectors in which we operate, our need to manage
our assets, and risks associated with our assets and their performance, including the fact that most have a limited history and a history
of operating losses, face intense competition and may never be profitable, the effect of economic conditions in the business sectors
in which we operate, compliance with government regulation and legal liabilities. Many of these factors are beyond our ability
to predict or control. In addition, as a result of these and other factors, our past financial performance should not be relied on as
an indication of future performance. All forward-looking statements attributable to us, or to persons acting on our behalf, are expressly
qualified in their entirety by this cautionary statement. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking
statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law. In light of these risks and
uncertainties, the forward-looking events and circumstances discussed in this report might not occur. 

JOBS
Act 

We
qualify as an emerging growth company as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups (JOBS) Act of 2012 (the JOBS Act).
As an emerging growth company, we may take advantage of certain reduced disclosure and other requirements that are otherwise applicable
generally to public companies. Pursuant to these provisions: 

we
 are not required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the Sarbanes-Oxley
 Act); 

we
 have (i) reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and (ii) exemptions
 from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation, including golden parachute compensation. 

We
may take advantage of these provisions for up to five years or until such earlier time that we are no longer an emerging growth company. 

We
would cease to be an emerging growth company upon the earliest to occur of (1) the last day of the fiscal year in which we have
more than 1.07 billion in annual revenue; (2) the date we qualify as a large accelerated filer, with at least
 700 million of public float (3) the issuance, in any three-year period, by us of more than 1.0 billion in non-convertible debt
securities held by non-affiliates; and (4) the last day of the fiscal year ending after the fifth anniversary of our initial
public offering. 

In
addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can use the extended transition period provided
in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. This permits an emerging growth
company to delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We intend
to take advantage of the exemptions discussed above. Accordingly, the information contained herein may be different than the information
you receive from other public companies.

Overview 

Token
Communities, Ltd. (hereinafter the Company , Our , We or Us researches and creates
white paper analysis for companies regarding block chain technology, and also operates the Lukki Exchange, including all
client lists, intellectual property related to the Lukki operating Tokens LOT ). The Lukki Exchange offers its users the
user-friendly interface an in-depth experience in crypto assets trading. We do not believe the operation of the Lukki Exchange triggers
any obligations under the Securities Act or Securities Exchange Act, including any requirements to register as a national securities
exchange, alternative trading system or broker-dealer, or any obligations to register with the CFTC as a futures exchange. The Lukki
Exchange is operated outside of the United States (China), and not available to citizens of the United States. Further the LOT is not
a security as established in the US Supreme Court case of SEC v Howey. The Howey Test has remained a notable determiner
of regulatory oversight for many decades. In the past few years, it has been called into question, most frequently in conjunction with
discussions about cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology. In SEC v Howey , the Supreme Court articulated the legal
standard for determining when a financial arrangement may be deemed an investment contract and, therefore, a security. 
As Howey and its progeny explain, a financial arrangement is an investment contract if the arrangement
involves (1) an investment of money; (2) in a common enterprise; (3) with a reasonable expectation of profits to be (4) derived from
the entrepreneurial or managerial efforts of others. The Howey Test determines that a transaction represents an investment contract
if a person invests his money in a common enterprise and is led to expect profits solely from the efforts of the promoter
or a third party, Here there is no evidence of investors reasonable expectation of profits derived predominantly from
the managerial efforts of others. In recent years, the SEC has ruled that the two most valuable cryptocurrencies Bitcoin and Ethereum are
not securities, Further we do not undertake any brokerage activities including marketing and facilitating the sale of digital assets,
accepting investors orders and funds for payment, and enabling the disbursement of proceeds. We do not receive compensation
based on a percentage of the proceeds raised. We also do not purchase and then resell LOT for accounts in the Company name.

Our
Company 

The
Company researches and creates white paper analysis for companies regarding block chain technology, and also operates the Lukki
Exchange, including all client lists, intellectual property related to the brand Lukki . Lukki Exchange is designed
in such a way that one can start trading path with maximum comfort and all the necessary tools. The platform offers its users the user-friendly
interface an in-depth experience in crypto assets trading. 

LOT
Token 

Lukki

and transparent for providing the best trading experience on the exchange and create an incredible investment ability for traders. LOT
tokens are ERC20 tokens based on ethereum chain. The LOT token is listed on several exchanges, such as STEX.com, P2PB2B.io, Whitebit.io,
and Lukki.io. A total amount of 2,000,000,000 LOT tokens have been issued. The Company holds 1,999,321,726 LOT Tokens. 

Intellectual
Property 

We
do not currently own, and do not have any current plans to seek, any patents in connection with our existing and planned blockchain and
cryptocurrency related operations. We do not have any copyrights, trademarks, but we generally rely upon copyright, trademark and trade
secret laws to protect and maintain our proprietary rights for our technology and products. Notwithstanding the steps we have taken to
protect our intellectual property rights, third parties may infringe or misappropriate our proprietary rights. Competitors may also independently
develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to the technologies we employ in our products and services. 

Competition 

There
are many companies offering or developing blockchain solutions, and there can be no assurance that direct competitors to our solutions
will arise. Our technology is designed to be compliant with the new GDPR and other Governmental regulations and initiatives to protect
the consumer s data but there is no guarantee that it will be in compliance. The markets for our products are intensely competitive,
continually evolving and subject to changing technologies. We face significant competition, including from companies that have entered
this space much earlier than us and are better capitalized, with vertically integrated business models, larger than us, have more access
to capital and have lower operating costs than we do. These competitors may be able to respond more rapidly to new or emerging technologies
and changes in customer requirements or to devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their products. These competitors
may enter our existing or future markets with currencies that may be less expensive, that may provide higher performance or additional
features or that may be introduced more quickly than our products. 

Industry

A
blockchain, also known as a distributed ledger technology, is a sequential, ever-growing, time-stamped set of records that
are grouped in blocks and maintained by disparate participants. Each block is interdependent, making alterations of records economically
difficult if not outright impossible. A Blockchain includes, but is not limited to, the following features: 

decentralized and distributed
 digital ledger used to record and secure transactions, which deters fraud. 

transactions cannot be
 changed. 

transactions can be verified
 and audited. 

confirmation that each
 unit of value was transferred only once. 

2 

The
blockchain, being a globally distributed ledger running on millions of devices, is capable of recording transfers of anything of value.
Two or more parties, be they businesses or individuals who may not even know each other, can forge agreements, make transactions, and
build value without relying on intermediaries (such as banks, payment institutions, rating agencies and other third parties) to verify
their identities, establish trust, or perform the critical business logic contracting, clearing, settling, and record-keeping tasks that
are foundational to all forms of commerce. As opposed to a centralized database whereby an entire database, or full copies of that database,
remains in the control of one person or entity stored on a computer that is controlled or owned by that same person or entity, a blockchain
ledger typically has partial copies of itself across various nodes, or computers, in the network. Each new block requires a method of
consensus between nodes of the network in order for the block to post to the ledger and become permanent. There are various methods being
developed for executing a consensus. Currently, the most popular blockchain is Bitcoin, a cryptocurrency, which uses a mathematical problem
to be solved before it can be confirmed and added to its blockchain. Cryptocurrencies are a medium of exchange that are transacted through
and recorded on a blockchain and therefore within our scope of business. The Bitcoin consensus process, for example, entails solving
complex mathematical problems using custom designed computers. However, many more public and private blockchains are being developed
with different algorithms or consensus models, which can use different hardware and methods for performing function of adding blocks
to their blockchains. 

Cryptocurrencies
are currencies that are not backed by a central bank or a national, supra-national or quasi-national organization and are not typically
backed by hard assets or other credit. Cryptocurrencies are typically used as a medium of exchange, similar to fiat currencies like the
U.S. Dollar. In addition to cryptocurrencies, there are other assets such as contracts or other information that reside on a blockchain
that represent a form of ownership. Examples may include insurance contracts, deeds, wills, health data, or securities. The value of
is determined by the value that various market participants place on them through their transactions, for example, via peer-to-peer transactions,
e-commerce, or exchanges. 

Government
Regulation 

 Government
regulation of blockchain and cryptocurrency is being actively considered by the United States federal government through various agencies
and regulatory bodies, as well as other countries and transnational organizations, such as the European Union. State and local regulations
also may apply to our activities such and other activities in which we participate or may participate in the future. Other governmental
or semi-governmental regulatory bodies have shown an interest in regulating or investigating companies engaged in the blockchain or cryptocurrency
business. For instance, the SEC has taken an active role in regulating the use of public offerings of proprietary coins (so-called Initial
Coin Offerings and has made statements and official promulgations as to the status of certain cryptocurrencies as securities 
subject to regulation by the SEC. 

Presently,
we do not believe any U.S. or State regulatory body has taken any action or position adverse to our main cryptocurrency, Lukki, with
respect to its production, sale, and use as a medium of exchange; however, future changes to existing regulations or entirely new regulations
may affect our business in ways it is not presently possible for us to predict with any reasonable degree of reliability. As the regulatory
and legal environment evolves, we may become subject to new laws, further regulation by the SEC and other agencies, which may affect
our mining and other activities. For additional discussion regarding our belief about the potential risks existing and future regulation
pose to our business, see the Section entitled Risk Factors herein and in our other SEC filings, which are incorporated
by reference herein. 

Employees 

Currently
we and our subsidiaries employ a total of nine individuals. These individuals consist of management, developers, sales and support staff.
Some of these individuals are employed through outside sourcing companies.

The
following discussion should be read in conjunction with our audited financial statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere
in this Annual Report. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs. Our
actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute
to such differences include, but are not limited to those discussed below and elsewhere in this Annual Report. Our audited financial
statements are stated in United States Dollars and are prepared in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. 

Plan
of Operation 

Token
Communities Ltd. (the Company or Limited researches and creates white paper analysis for companies regarding
block chain technology, and also operates the Lukki Exchange, including all client lists, intellectual property related
to the brand Lukki . 

Results
from Operations For the year ended J une 30, 2021 as compared to June 30, 2020 

Revenue 

For
the years ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, the Company had total sales of 0 and 0, respectively. The lack of revenues was due to the inability
of the Company to generate sales. 

Operating
Expenses 

Total
operating expenses increased from 165,233 in 2020 to 1,790,381 in 2021, an increase of 1,625,148. The increase was primarily due to
the initiation of the Shenzhen operation. The company had set up an office, hired employees, and set up marketing campaigns to support
the Shenzhen market. 

Loss
From Operations 

As
a result of the foregoing, our loss from operations was 1,790,381 for the year ended June 30, 2021, compared with 165,233, for the
year ended June 30, 2020. The increase in our overall loss from operations was a result of a slowdown in business operations and an increase
in General and Administrative expenses in Shenzhen. 

Other
Income (Expense) 

Other
Income (Expense) decreased from 518,400,000 in 2020 to 262,115 in 2021. This decrease was due to an increase in the change in fair
value of derivative liability relating to stock warrants which were cancelled in 2020. 

Net
Income (Loss) 

For
the year ended June 30, 2020 the Company had net income of approximately 518,234,767 compared to a net loss of approximately 1,528,265)
for the year ended June 30, 2021, a decrease of 519,763,032. The decrease is primarily due to the change in fair value of derivative
liability as discussed above. The change in valuation was related to the warrant holders releasing the Company of their obligation under
the original warrants as part of the transaction on July 14, 2020. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

As
of June 30, 2021 and 2020, the Company had 1,148 in Total Assets, consisting of 312 in cash, 836 in other assets. The Company s
total liabilities exceeded its consolidated current assets by approximately 1,753,869 as of June 30, 2021 primarily due to 927,987
due to related parties. Total liabilities exceeded its consolidated current assets by approximately and 893,140 as of June 30, 2020. 

6 

As
of June 30, 2021, the Company has yet to achieve profitable operations, and while the Company hopes to achieve profitable operations
in the future, if not it may need to raise capital from stockholders or other sources to sustain operations and to ultimately achieve
viable operations. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The Company s
principal sources of liquidity have been cash provided by operating activities, as well as its ability to raise capital. The Company s
operating results for future periods are subject to numerous uncertainties and it is uncertain if the Company will be able to become
profitable and continue growth for the foreseeable future. If management is not able to increase revenue and/or manage operating expenses,
the Company may not be able to maintain profitability. The Company s ability to continue in existence is dependent on the Company s
ability to achieve profitable operations. 

To
continue operations for the next 12 months we will have a cash need of approximately 500,000. Should we not be able to fulfill our cash
needs through the increase of revenue we will need to raise money through outside investors through convertible notes, debt or similar
instrument(s), the Company has no committed external source of funds, and there is no guarantee we would be able to raise such funds.
The Company plans to pay off current liabilities through sales and increasing revenue through sales of Company services and or products,
or through financing activities as mentioned above. 

Our
cash flows for the year ended June 30, 2021 and 2020 are summarized below:

Critical
Accounting Policies 

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
period. Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation
of the Consolidated Financial Statements. Estimates are used for, but not limited to, contingencies and taxes. Actual results could differ
materially from those estimates. The following critical accounting policies are impacted significantly by judgments, assumptions, and
estimates used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

7 

Loss
Contingencies 

The
Company is subject to various loss contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business. The Company considers the likelihood of
loss or impairment of an asset or the incurrence of a liability, as well as its ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss in
determining loss contingencies. An estimated loss contingency is accrued when management concludes that it is probable that an asset
has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. The Company regularly evaluates
current information available to us to determine whether such accruals should be adjusted. 

Income
Taxes 

The
Company recognizes deferred tax assets (future tax benefits) and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences
between the book carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities. The deferred tax assets and liabilities represent the
expected future tax return consequences of those differences, which are expected to be either deductible or taxable when the assets and
liabilities are recovered or settled. 

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements 

See
Note 2 of the consolidated financial statements for discussion of Recent Accounting Pronouncements. 

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements 

We
are not currently a party to, or otherwise involved with, any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have
a current or future material effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations,
liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. 

Recently
Adopted Accounting Standards 

In
May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Topic
606, or ASU 2014-09. ASU 2014-09 establishes the principles for recognizing revenue and develops a common revenue standard for U.S.
GAAP. The standard outlines a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers
and supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance. In applying the new revenue recognition
model to contracts with customers, an entity: (1) identifies the contract(s) with a customer; (2) identifies the performance obligations
in the contract(s); (3) determines the transaction price; (4) allocates the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract(s);
and (5) recognizes revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. The accounting standards update applies to all
contracts with customers except those that are within the scope of other topics in the FASB Accounting Standards Codification. The accounting
standards update also requires significantly expanded quantitative and qualitative disclosures regarding the nature, amount, timing and
uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. This guidance is effective for fiscal years and interim
periods within those years beginning after December 15, 2017. The Company adopt ed ASU 2014-09 effective January 1, 2018. The adoption
of this standard had no material impact on the Company s financial statements. 

Item
7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 

Pursuant
to Item 305(e) of Regulation S-K 229.305(e)), the Company is not required to provide the information required by this Item as
it is a smaller reporting company, as defined by Rule 229.10(f)(1).

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING
FIRM 

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders 
Token Communities, Ltd. 

Report on the Financial Statements 

We have audited the accompanying balance sheets
of Token Communities, Ltd. (the Company), which comprise the balance sheet as of June 30, 2021, and the related statement of Operations,
Changes in Stockholder s Equity, and Cash Flows for the year then ended, and the related notes to the financial statements. 

Management s Responsibility for the Financial
Statements 

Management is responsible for the preparation
and fair presentation of these financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America; this includes the design, implementation, and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation
of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. 

Auditor s Responsibility 

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
these financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the
United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free from material misstatements. 

An audit involves performing procedures to obtain
audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor s judgment,
including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those
risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity s preparation and fair presentation of the financial
statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion
on the effectiveness of the entity s internal control. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes evaluating
the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by management, as well
as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient
and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. 

Emphasis of Matter Regarding Going Concern 

The accompanying financial statements have been
prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As described in Note 3 to the financial statements, the Company has
not generated any revenues since inception and sustained a net loss of 1,528,625 for the year under audit and has accumulated losses
of 3,015,786. These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern.
Management s plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 3. The financial statements do not include any adjustments
that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. Our opinion is not modified with respect to this matter. 

Opinion 

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Token Communities, Ltd., as of June 30, 2021, and the results of its operations
and its cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 

Emphasis of Matters-Risks and Uncertainties 

The Company is not able to predict the
ultimate impact that COVID -19 will have on its business. However, if the current economic conditions continue, the pandemic could
have an adverse impact on the economies and financial markets of many countries, including the geographical area in which the
Company plans to operate. 

We have served as the Company s auditor since 2021.

REPORT
OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

To
the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Token Communities, Ltd. 

Opinion
on the Financial Statements 

We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Token Communities, Ltd. and its subsidiaries (the Company as of June 30, 2020 and 2019 and the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income, stockholders deficit
and cash flows for the years then ended, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements ).
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of
the Company as of June 30, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its consolidated operations and its cash flows for the years then ended,
in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 

Explanatory
Paragraph Going Concern 

The
accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed
in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has suffered recurring losses from operations since inception and expects
to continue to generate operating losses and negative cash flows for the foreseeable future. These conditions raise substantial doubt
about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management s plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 1. The
consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

Basis
for Opinion 

These
consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion
on the Company s consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company
in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission
and the PCAOB. 

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud.
The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part
of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing
an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our
audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether
due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures include examining, on a test basis, evidence
regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Note
1 Organization and Basis of Presentation 

Organization
and Line of Business 

Token
Communities Ltd. (the Company or Limited was organized under the laws of the State of Delaware on March
6, 2014, under the name Pacific Media Group Enterprises, Inc. On April 7, 2017, the Company amended its Certificate of Incorporation
with the Secretary of State of Delaware, changing its name to Extract Pharmaceuticals Inc. On January 26, 2018, the Board of Directors
adopted an Amendment to its Certificate of Incorporation, changing its name to Token Communities Ltd. The Company is a development
stage company that researches and creates white paper analysis for companies regarding block chain technology. 

On
February 26, 2018, the Company entered into an Acquisition and Share Exchange Agreement with Token Communities PLC PLC ).
 Under the Agreement, the Company s majority shareholder returned 19,266,000 common shares to treasury, and at closing 100 
of the issued and outstanding shares of PLC were acquired by the Company, for 172,800,000 newly issued common shares equal to 64 of
the Company s outstanding common stock as of the closing date, thus making the stockholders of PLC the majority stockholders of
the Company. The transaction closed on May 18, 2018. This transaction was accounted for as a reverse acquisition under the purchase
method of accounting since PLC obtained control of Limited. Accordingly, the merger of PLC into Limited was recorded as a recapitalization
of PLC, PLC being treated as the continuing entity. The transaction was treated as a recapitalization and not as a business combination.
Limited had 116,466,000 shares outstanding prior to the merger. At the time of the merger, Limited s principal stockholder surrendered
19,266,000 shares, which were cancelled. After the merger the total number of Limited shares outstanding was 270,000,000. 

PLC

The
historical financial statements presented are the financial statements of PLC. The Acquisition and Share Exchange Agreement was treated
as a recapitalization and not as a business combination; therefore, no pro forma information is disclosed. At the date of the merger,
the net liabilities of the legal acquirer, Limited, were 57,107. 

The
combined entities are referred to hereafter as the Company. 

F- 7 

On
May 28, 2020, the Company acquired 3.5 billion iRide tokens in exchange for 80 million shares provided to iRide.io Tech Pte., Ltd., valued
at 8,000, which was immediately expensed. 

On
July 14, 2020, a change in control of the Company was affected by a privately held corporation (American Software Capital, Inc. ASC )),
controlled by David Chen, Director and President/CEO of the Company) acquiring 83 of the outstanding stock from the Company. As part
of this transaction, the Company transferred the 3.5 billion iRide tokens and 1,745,406,000 shares of its common stock to ASC in exchange
for all technology, software codes and other intelligent products of the Lukki Exchange, a non-operating cyber coin exchange. Since the
Lukki exchange had no previous material revenue nor assets, the acquisition has been accounted for as an asset acquisition and due to
the fact that it has no value, and the parties to this transaction are related, the transaction has been accounted for as (0), the value
of the tokens are (0), and no financial statements are being provided as part of the transaction. 

As
a condition to the closing of the transactions contemplated in the Asset Purchase Agreement shareholders agreed to cancel an aggregate
of 174,540,600 shares of Common Stock of the Company, and the holders of the Company s Series A, B, C, D and E warrants agreed
to the cancellation of all such warrants. 

Basis
of Presentation 

The
accompanying consolidated financial statements CFS were prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States U.S. GAAP ). Limited s functional currency is the United States Dollars or
 USD and Limited s wholly-owned subsidiary, PLC s functional currency is the Pound Sterling GBP ).

Going
Concern 

The
accompanying CFS were prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP, which contemplates the continuation of the Company as a going concern. The
Company had a stockholders deficit of 1,753,869 at June 30, 2021 and has incurred losses from operations since inception and
expects to continue to generate operating losses and negative cash flows for the foreseeable future. These factors raise substantial
doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The continued operations of the Company are dependent upon its
ability to raise additional capital, obtain additional financing and/or acquire or develop a business that generates sufficient positive
cash flows from operations. 

The
accompanying CFS do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded assets, or the amounts
and classification of liabilities that might be necessary in the event the Company cannot continue as a going concern. 

F- 8 

Foreign
Currency Translation 

The
accounts of Limited are maintained in USD and the accounts of PLC are maintained in GBP. The accounts of PLC are translated into USD
in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB Accounting Standards Codification ASC Topic
830 Foreign Currency Transaction , with the GBP as the functional currency. According to Topic 830, all assets and liabilities
are translated at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date, stockholders equity is translated at historical rates and statement
of operations items are translated at the weighted average exchange rate for the period. The resulting translation adjustments are reported
under other comprehensive income (loss) in accordance with ASC Topic 220, Comprehensive Income . Gains and losses resulting from
the translations of foreign currency transactions and balances are reflected in the statement of operations and comprehensive income

Note
2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 

Use
of Estimates 

The
preparation of CFS in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the CFS and the reported
amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The Company regularly evaluates estimates and assumptions. The Company
bases its estimates and assumptions on current facts, historical experience and various other factors that it believes to be
reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and
liabilities and the accrual of costs and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. The actual results experienced
by the Company may differ materially and adversely from the Company s estimates. To the extent there are material differences
between the estimates and the actual results, future results of operations will be affected. 

Principles
of Consolidation 

The
accompanying CFS include the accounts of Limited and its wholly-owned Subsidiary, PLC. All significant intercompany transactions and
balances were eliminated in consolidation. 

F- 9 

Cash Equivalents 

For the purpose of the statement of cash flows, cash equivalents include
time deposits, certificate of deposits, and all highly liquid debt instruments with original maturities of three months or less. 

Accounts Receivable 

Accounts receivable are recorded, net of allowance
for doubtful accounts and sales returns. Management reviews the composition of accounts receivable and analyzes historical bad debts,
customer concentration, customer credit worthiness, current economic trends and changes in customer payment patterns to determine if the
allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate. An estimate for doubtful accounts is made when collection of the full amount is no longer
probable. Delinquent account balances are written-off after management has determined that the likelihood of collection is not probable
and known bad debts are written off against the allowance for doubtful accounts when identified. As of June 30, 2021 and 2020,
the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable was zero, respectively. 

Derivative Financial Instruments 

The Company evaluates its agreements to determine
if such instruments have derivatives or contain features that qualify as embedded derivatives. For derivative financial instruments that
are accounted for as liabilities, the derivative instrument is initially recorded at its fair value and is then re-valued at each reporting
date, with changes in the fair value reported in the statements of operations. Valuation of the derivatives by the Company requires significant
estimates and assumptions for each period. For the periods ended June 30, 2021 and June 30, 2020 respectively, the assumptions related
to derivative valuation was as follows:

For stock-based derivative financial
instruments, the Company uses a Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model to value the derivative instruments at inception and on
subsequent valuation dates. The classification of derivative instruments, including whether such instruments should be recorded as
liabilities or as equity, is evaluated at the end of each reporting period. Derivative instrument liabilities are classified in the
balance sheet as current or non-current based on whether or not net-cash settlement of the derivative instrument could be required
within 12 months of the balance sheet date. As of June 30, 2020, the Company s only derivative financial instruments were
outstanding warrants since the Company did not have enough unissued authorized shares to satisfy the exercise of all the outstanding
warrants. As of June 30, 2020, we noted that the warrant holders released the Company of their obligation under the original
warrants as part of the transaction on July 14, 2020. As evidence was obtained that impacted the valuation on June 30, 2020 after
the balance sheet date that impacted the balance at June 30, 2020, the warrants were written down to zero. There were no additional
warrants issued during the period ended June 30, 2021.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments 

For certain of the Company s financial instruments,
including cash and equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, trust liability and advances, the carrying amounts approximate
their fair values due to their short maturities. 

FASB ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements
and Disclosures , requires disclosure of the fair value FV of financial instruments held by the Company. FASB ASC Topic
825, Financial Instruments , defines FV, and establishes a three-level valuation hierarchy for disclosures of FV measurement that
enhances disclosure requirements for FV measures. The carrying amounts reported in the consolidated balance sheets for receivables and
current liabilities each qualify as financial instruments and are a reasonable estimate of their FVs because of the short period of time
between the origination of such instruments and their expected realization and their current market rate of interest. The three levels
of valuation hierarchy are defined as follows: 

Level
1 inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets. 

Level
2 inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical
or similar assets in inactive markets, and inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for
substantially the full term of the financial instrument. 

Level
3 inputs to the valuation methodology use one or more unobservable inputs which are significant to the FV measurement. 

The Company analyzes all financial
instruments with features of both liabilities and equity under FASB ASC Topic 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity , and
FASB ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging . 

F- 11 

The Company uses Level 2 inputs
for its valuation methodology for derivative liabilities as their fair values were determined by using the Black-Scholes-Merton pricing
model based on various assumptions. As of June 30, 2020, the Company s stock price used in the Black-Scholes-Merton pricing model
was based on recent sales of the Company s common stock to unrelated investors since there no market price for the Company s
common stock at June 30, 2020. The Company s derivative liabilities are adjusted to reflect FV at each period end, with any increase
or decrease in the FV being recorded in results of operations as adjustments to fair value of derivatives. 

Revenue Recognition 

ASU No. 2014-09 , Revenue from
Contracts with Customers Topic 606 ), became effective for the Company on July 1, 2018. The Company s
revenue recognition disclosure reflects its updated accounting policies that are affected by this new standard. The Company applied
the modified retrospective transition method for open contracts for the implementation of Topic 606. As
sales are and have been primarily from advisory fees and related services, and the Company has no significant post-delivery
obligations, this did not result in a material recognition of revenue on our accompanying CFS for the cumulative impact of applying
this new standard. The Company made no adjustments to its previously-reported total revenues, as those periods continue to be
presented in accordance with its historical accounting practices under Topic 605, Revenue Recognition . 

Revenue from advisory fees and related services
are recognized under Topic 606 in a manner that reasonably reflects the delivery of services to customers in return for
expected consideration and includes the following elements: 

executed
contract(s) with our customer(s) that we believe is legally enforceable; 

identification
of performance obligation in the respective contract; 

determination
of the transaction price for each performance obligation in the respective contract; 

allocation
of the transaction price to each performance obligation; and 

recognition
of revenue only when the Company satisfies each performance obligation. 

F- 12 

These five elements, as applied to the Company s
only revenue category, are summarized below: 

Advisory
fees and related services the Company charges advisory fees for a suite of one to two dozen services that include advising
on where to establish a corporation, establishing the corporation (often Gibraltar or Malta), writing white paper, setting up website,
making videos or animations describing the company and its business, engaging in public relations, and introducing potential investors. 

Income Taxes 

The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance
with ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes . ASC 740 requires a company to use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes,
whereby deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences, and deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable
temporary differences. Temporary differences are the differences between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax
bases. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some
portion, or all of, the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the
effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment. 

Under ASC 740, a tax position is recognized as
a benefit only if it is more likely than not that the tax position would be sustained in a tax examination, with a tax examination
being presumed to occur. The amount recognized is the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50 likely of being realized
on examination. For tax positions not meeting the more likely than not test, no tax benefit is recorded. The Company has
no material uncertain tax positions for any of the reporting periods presented. 

Basic and Diluted Earnings (loss) Per Share 

Earnings per share is calculated in accordance
with ASC Topic 260, Earnings Per Share . Basic earnings per share EPS is based on the weighted average number of
common shares outstanding. Diluted EPS is based on the assumption that all dilutive securities are converted. Dilution is computed
by applying the treasury stock method. Under this method, options and warrants are assumed to be exercised at the beginning of the period
(or at the time of issuance, if later), and as if funds obtained thereby were used to purchase common stock at the average market price
during the period. There were no potentially dilutive securities outstanding during any of the periods presented in these financial statements. 

Foreign Currency Transactions and Comprehensive Income 

U.S. GAAP generally requires recognized revenue,
expenses, gains and losses be included in net income. Certain statements, however, require entities to report specific changes in assets
and liabilities, such as gain or loss on foreign currency translation, as a separate component of the equity section of the balance sheet.
Such items, along with net income, are components of comprehensive income. The functional currency of the Company s subsidiary is
the GBP. Translation gain of 19,609 at June 30, 2021 is classified as an item of other comprehensive income in the stockholders 
deficit section of the balance sheet. 

F- 13 

Statement of Cash Flows 

Cash flows from the Company s operations
are calculated based upon the local currencies using the average translation rates. As a result, amounts related to assets and liabilities
reported on the statements of cash flows will not necessarily agree with changes in the corresponding balances on the balance sheets. 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements 

In January 2017, the FASB issued Accounting Standards
Update ASU 2017-01, Business Combinations (Topic 805) Clarifying the Definition of a Business . The amendments
in this update clarify the definition of a business with the objective of adding guidance to assist entities with evaluating whether transactions
should be accounted for as acquisitions or disposals of assets or businesses. The definition of a business affects many areas of accounting
including acquisitions, disposals, goodwill, and consolidation. The guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after
December 15, 2017 and should be applied prospectively on or after the effective date. The Company is in the process of evaluating
the impact of this ASU on the Company s CFS. 

In November 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-18,
 Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash, which requires restricted cash to be presented with cash and cash equivalents
on the statement of cash flows and disclosure of how the statement of cash flows reconciles to the balance sheet if restricted cash is
shown separately from cash and cash equivalents on the balance sheet. ASU 2016-18 is effective for interim and annual periods beginning
after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted. The adoption of this ASU did not have an impact on the Company s CFS. 

In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-16,
 Income Taxes (Topic 740): Intra-Entity Transfer of Assets Other than Inventory , which requires the recognition of the income
tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset, other than inventory, when the transfer occurs. ASU 2016-16 is effective for
interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. The Company is in the process of evaluating
the impact of this ASU on the Company s CFS. 

In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15 , Statement
of Cash Flows (Topic 230), Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments . ASU 2016-15 provides guidance for targeted
changes with respect to how cash receipts and cash payments are classified in the statements of cash flows, with the objective of reducing
diversity in practice. ASU 2016-15 is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption
permitted. The adoption of this ASU did not have an impact on the Company s CFS. 

F- 14 

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,
 Leases (Topic 842) . ASU 2016-02 requires lessees to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and
requires expanded disclosures about leasing arrangements. ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018
and interim periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. The Company is in the process
of evaluating the impact of this ASU on the Company s CFS. 

In May 2014, FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue
from Contracts with Customers . ASU 2014-09 is a comprehensive revenue recognition standard that will supersede nearly all existing
revenue recognition guidance under current U.S. GAAP and replace it with a principle-based approach for determining revenue recognition. 
ASU 2014-09 will require that companies recognize revenue based on the value of transferred goods or services as they occur in the contract. 
The ASU also will require additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from
customer contracts, including significant judgments and changes in judgments and assets recognized from costs incurred to obtain or fulfill
a contract. ASU 2014-09 is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption
is permitted only in annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods therein. Entities will
be able to transition to the standard either retrospectively or as a cumulative-effect adjustment as of the date of adoption. The
Company adopted this ASU on October 13, 2017 and used the modified retrospective method of adoption. The adoption of this ASU did not
have a material impact on the Company s CFS. 

Management does not believe that any recently
issued, but not yet effective, accounting standards could have a material effect on the accompanying CFS. As new accounting pronouncements
are issued, we will adopt those that are applicable under the circumstances. 

Risks and Uncertainties 

In December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus
(COVID-19) emerged in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. While initially the outbreak was largely concentrated in China and caused significant
disruptions to its economy, it has now spread to several other countries and infections have been reported globally fiscal first quarter
and potentially beyond. 

Because COVID-19 infections have been reported
throughout the United States, certain federal, state and local governmental authorities have issued stay-at-home orders, proclamations
and/or directives aimed at minimizing the spread of COVID-19. Additional, more restrictive proclamations and/or directives may be issued
in the future. As a result, all of our office locations have been closed effective April 1, 2020. 

The ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic
on the Company s operations is unknown and will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be
predicted with confidence, including the duration of the COVID-19 outbreak, new information which may emerge concerning the severity
of the COVID-19 pandemic, and any additional preventative and protective actions that governments, or the Company, may direct, which
may result in an extended period of continued business disruption, reduced customer traffic and reduced operations. Any resulting
financial impact cannot be reasonably estimated at this time but is anticipated to have a material adverse impact on our business,
financial condition and results of operations. 

F- 15 

The measures taken to date will impact the Company s
business for the fiscal fourth quarter and potentially beyond. Management expects that all of its business segments, across all of its
geographies, will be impacted to some degree, but the significance of the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on the Company s business
and the duration for which it may have an impact cannot be determined at this time. 

Management s Evaluation of Subsequent Events 

The Company evaluates events that have occurred
after the balance sheet date of June 30, 2021, through the date which the CFS were issued. Based upon the review, the Company did not
identify any recognized or non-recognized subsequent events that would have required adjustment or disclosure in the CFS.

Note 4 Stockholders Equity

As of June 30, 2021, the authorized share capital
of the Company consists of 5,000,000,000 shares of common and 20,000,000 shares of preferred stock with 0.0001 par value. Each outstanding
share of common stock entitles the holder to one vote per share on all matters submitted to a stockholder vote. All shares of common stock
are non-assessable and non-cumulative, with no pre-emptive rights. 

Prior to the transaction described in Note 1,
the Company had 116,466,000 shares of common stock outstanding. At the time of the merger, a principal shareholder surrendered 19,266,000
shares of common stock, which were cancelled. Also at the time of the merger, 172,800,000 shares of common stock were issued for all of
the issued and outstanding shares of PLC. The total shares outstanding at June 30, 2019 was 270,000,000. See Note 1 above. 

F- 16 

Prior to the transaction, the Company had 135,000,000
warrants outstanding consisting of 27,000,000 A Warrants each convertible into one share of common stock at 0.074; 27,000,000
 B Warrants each convertible into one share of common stock at an exercise price of 0.093; 27,000,000 C Warrants 
each convertible into one share of common stock at 0.111; 27,000,000 D Warrants each convertible into one share of common
stock at 0.129; and 27,000,000 E Warrants each convertible into one share of common stock at 0.148. 

On February 19, 2019, the Company and the holders
of 81,000,000 Warrants executed an Amendment and Modification Agreement, changing the warrant exercise prices from 0.074 to 0.148, to
 1.90 for all classes of warrants it held. On the same day the Company and the holders of 43,200,000 warrants split equally between Class
B, C, D and E (10,800,000 per class) executed an Amendment and Modification Agreement, changing the warrant exercise price to a phased
strike price ranging between 1.05 and 2.00. Previously the holder of 10,800,000 A Warrants also entered into an amendment
and modification agreement, changing the warrant strike price ranging from 1.05 to 2.00 

Following the transaction described in Note 1,
last year a number of warrants which had previously been issued have been under review by the Company to ensure their original terms and
conditions were not out of synchronization with the business plans overall of the newly restructured company going forward. One warrant
holder of A Class warrants requested the original terms of his warrants be amended to accommodate the anticipated rise in value execution
of the business plan would be expected to have on the Company value. Increases in the warrant strike price benefits the Company as increased
funds are raised and placed directly in the company upon the exercise of the warrant. Accordingly the Company consented to vary the strike
price on an increasing sliding scale from 1.05 to 2.00. Following a review post the recent share fluctuations, management and the other
warrant holders agreed it is in the best interests of the Company, stock and warrant holders that the remaining warrants are also amended
to follow the precedent set in respect of the previously amended warrant conditions. With the exception of the A Class warrants which
were already amended as detailed above, the remaining warrants have been extended to expire on August 30, 2022. This was finalized on
February 21, 2019. 

The warrants were cancelled subsequent to the
year ended June 30, 2020. 

On July 23, 2019, the Company issued 80,000,000
shares as part of an acquisition whose terms were considered immaterial. 

On June 30, 2020 the Company issued 277,200 shares of common stock
in settlement of debt of 268,942. 

On July 14, 2020, the Company issued 1,745,000,585
shares as part of the acquisition agreement described in Note 1. This resulted in an expense on the income statement in the amount of
 174,500. 

F- 17 

On August 12, 2020, the Company issued 595,162
shares of common stock for services with a deemed value of 595,162. 

Note 5 Related Party Transactions 

Amounts due to a related party are for advances
made by a stockholder of the Company. The balance due of 927,987 and 261,695 as at June 30, 2021 and June 30, 2020 respectively, is
presented as due to related parties in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. The amounts due are non-interest bearing and
payable upon demand. In the period ended June 30, 2021, certain related parties forgave advances and accrued expenses in the amount of
 262,116. This resulted in a gain on forgiveness of debt on the income statement in the amount of 262,116. 

Note 6 Commitments and Contingencies 

The Company is party to certain legal proceedings
from time to time incidental to the conduct of its business. These proceedings could result in fines, penalties, compensatory or treble
damages or non-monetary relief. The nature of legal proceedings is such that the Company cannot assure the outcome of any particular matter,
and an unfavorable ruling or development could have a materially adverse effect on the Company s CFS in the period in which a ruling
or settlement occurs. However, based on information available to the Company s management to date, the Company s management
does not expect the outcome of any matter pending against the Company is likely to have a material effect on the Company s CFS. 

On July 6, 2018 PLC entered into a binding agreement

None. 

Item 9A. Controls and Procedures. 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

We have performed an evaluation
under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our President, and our Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and
Chief Financial Officer (CFO), of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)
under the Exchange Act) as of June 30, 2021. Based on that evaluation, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and
CFO, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of June 30, 2021 to provide reasonable assurance that
information required to be disclosed by us in the reports filed or submitted by us under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to
our management, including our principal executive officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure due
to the material weaknesses described below. 

Based on our evaluation
under the framework described above, our management concluded that we had material weaknesses (as such term is defined below)
in our control environment and financial reporting process consisting of the following as of the Evaluation Date: 

1) 
 lack of a functioning audit committee resulting in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal control and procedures; and 

2) 
 inadequate segregation of duties consistent with control objectives 

A material weakness 
is defined under SEC rules as a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there
is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of a company s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented
or detected on a timely basis by the company s internal controls. 

A system of controls, no
matter how well designed and operated, cannot provide absolute assurance that the objectives of the system of controls are met, and no
evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within a company have been
detected. 

Management s Annual Report on Internal
Control over Financial Reporting 

Our management is responsible
for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f).
Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial
officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on criteria established
in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that (a) pertain to the maintenance
of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; (b)
provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit the preparation of financial statements in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with
authorizations of the our management and directors; and (c) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use or disposition of the Company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 

Item 9B. Other Information.

Director Compensation 

Directors
do not receive compensation for serving as a Director of the Company. 

Employment Agreements 

The Company does not have any written agreements
with any of its executive officers. 

Overview of Compensation Program 

We
currently do not maintain a Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. Until a formal committee is established, our entire Board
of Directors has responsibility for establishing, implementing and continually monitoring adherence with the Company s compensation
philosophy. The Board of Directors ensures that the total compensation paid to the executives is fair, reasonable, and competitive. 

Compensation Philosophy and Objectives 

The Board of Directors believes
that the most effective executive compensation program is one that is designed to reward the achievement of specific annual, long-term
and strategic goals by the Company and that aligns executives interests with those of the stockholders by rewarding performance
above established goals, with the ultimate objective of improving stockholder value. As a result of the size of the Company, the Board
evaluates both performance and compensation on an informal basis. Upon hiring additional executives, the Board intends to establish a
Compensation Committee to evaluate both performance and compensation to ensure that the Company maintains its ability to attract and
retain superior employees in key positions and that compensation provided to key employees remains competitive relative.

Role of Executive Officers In Compensation
Decisions
