ITEM
1. BUSINESS 

History
of the Company 

The
Company was originally incorporated in Nevada under the name Lepota Inc. on December 9, 2013. It maintains its principal
executive offices at Room 1703B, Zhongzhou Building, No. 3088 Jintian Road, Futian District, Shenzhen
City, Guangdong Province, People s Republic of China 518000 . The Company was formed for the purpose of importing and distributing
cosmetics into the Russian Federation. 

The
Company filed a registration statement on Form S-1 with the SEC on September 18, 2014, which was declared effective on May 4, 2016. However,
because the Company did not identify a viable business
model or engage in any business prior to the share exchange described below, it was a shell company until August 12, 2020. 

On
February 18, 2020, as a result of a private transaction, 5,000,000 shares of the Company s Common Stock were transferred from Rene
Lawrence, its controlling shareholder, to certain purchasers (the Purchasers ), with Zhao Lixin, the Company s current
CEO, becoming a 53.8 holder of the voting rights of the Company and the Purchasers becoming the controlling shareholders. As a result
of the change of control, Iurii Iurtaev resigned as the Company s president, chief executive officer, chief financial officer and
director and Rene Lawrence resigned as the Company s secretary. Zhao Lixin was then named 

3 

President,
Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer, Secretary and Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Company. 

On
August 12, 2020 (the Closing Date ), the Company closed on a share exchange (the Share Exchange with Mu Yan
Technology Holding Co., Limited, a limited liability company incorporated in Samoa Mu Yan Samoa and the holders of 100 
of the outstanding shares of Mu Yan Samoa s common stock (the Mu Yan Shareholders ). As a result, Mu Yan Samoa is
now a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. Under the Share Exchange Agreement, the Mu Yan Shareholders exchanged 100 of the outstanding
shares of Mu Yan Samoa s common stock for 300,000,000 shares of the Company s Common Stock. As a result of the Share Exchange,
effective September 22, 2020, the Company s name was changed to Mu Yan Technology Group Co., Limited. 

For
accounting purposes, the Share Exchange was treated as a recapitalization of the Company with Mu Yan Samoa as the acquirer. When we refer
in this Annual Report to business and financial information for fiscal years prior to the consummation of the Share Exchange, we are
referring to the business and financial information of Mu Yan Samoa unless the context suggests otherwise. 

As
a result of the closing of the Share Exchange, the Mu Yan Shareholders own approximately 98 of the total outstanding common shares of
the Company and the former shareholders of the Company own approximately 2 . The shares issued to the Mu Yan Shareholders in connection
with the Share Exchange were not registered under the Securities Act of 1933 (the Securities Act in reliance upon the
exemption from registration provided by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act, which exempts transactions by an issuer not involving
any public offering. These securities may not be offered or sold absent registration or an applicable exemption from the registration
requirement. 

As
a result of the recapitalization described above, management of the Company believes that the Company is no longer a shell company. The
Company s operations now consist of the operations of Mu Yan Samoa and its subsidiaries. 

Throughout
the remainder of this Annual Report, when we use phrases such as we, our, company and us, 
we are referring to the Company and all of its subsidiaries, as a combined entity.

Corporate
Structure 

The
following chart sets forth our corporate structure immediately following the Share Exchange: 

The
Company is a US holding company incorporated in Nevada on December 9, 2013, which operates through its wholly owned subsidiary, Mu Yan

The
Business of Mu Yan (Shenzhen) Digital Technology Co., Limited 

We
are a technology company developing and selling our Mobile Advertising Backpack, called Huobaobao, with a programmable screen for the
offline marketing and advertising industry. Our backpacks are currently sold to consumers in the PRC, although we intend to expand into
the global market. We display advertising content to target customers through our backpack s advertising screen. The Huobaobao
can display a variety of content, from videos to photos to text. 

Our
Services and Products 

Graphic
rendering of our Huobaobao backpack being worn by consumers. 

We
sell our Huobaobao, backpack with a programmable screen for the marketing and advertising industry. We are currently selling the fourth
iteration of our Huobaobao backpack. The Huobaobao backpack includes a SIM card, and advertising content that is developed in partnership
with our advertising partners and our internal team is sent online from our platform servers to the backpack and played in real time.
The backpack includes a GPS navigation card which allows advertisers to localize and geotarget advertisements to their target consumers.
The ads are distributed on the backs of our customers and are viewed by a wide variety of individuals in a wide variety of physical places
within China. According to internal Company data, the Huobaobao backpack is viewed by an average of 4.2 people for every fifteen-second
advertisement that is broadcast on its screen, which management estimates to be an increase in viewers of two hundred times that of traditional
leaflets and five times that of elevator ads.

Exhibition
for the fourth iteration of our Huobaobao backpack. 

The
fourth iteration of our Huobaobao backpack has a 4,096 color advertising screen for high color accuracy and super clear video advertising,
with lower power consumption and an enhanced battery life compared to the last iteration. With 256MB of high speed memory, it can play
about 90 videos or more than 300 animated advertisements offline. It supports precise indoor and outdoor full coverage positioning function
with accurate advertising trajectory, both outdoors or indoors such as in shopping malls, subways and other indoor locations. The fourth
iteration backpack is made of ABS, which is a high strength, durable and water proof thermoplastic polymer material, while the back of
the backpack is made of a strong, breathable, honeycomb polyester fiber for comfort in addition to good wrinkle resistance and elasticity
for shape retention and shape recoverability. 

We
hire third-party manufacturing partners to manufacture our Huobaobao backpacks. We believe outsourcing to third parties allows us to
maximize our capacity and maintain flexibility, while reducing capital expenditures and improving our product upgrades. 

The
Huobaobao backpack will play fifty different advertisements per day, each of which lasts approximately fifteen seconds. Each Huobaobao
backpack includes a power bank and, depending on the price of that accessory, can run content for as little as four hours and as much
as twelve hours. 

Sales
and Marketing 

From
January 1, 2020 to July 31, 2021, we sold 32,900 Huobaobao backpacks into the Chinese market, or an average of 2,350 backpacks per month.
Our sales have been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and new product roll-out delays. The Company is in the process of building a website
to feature its Huobaobao backpacks and expects to launch the website before the end of the 2021 calendar year. We are communicating with
marketing agencies to assist with brand development, but we currently do not rely heavily on advertising to sell our backpacks. 

7 

The
Advertising Market in China 

Currently
we only sell our products within the PRC, although our goal is to expand into the international market. According to www.baidu.com ,
the advertising market in the PRC generates approximately 700 billion per year in revenue, compared to approximately 3.9 trillion worldwide.
The proportion of advertising revenue to total GDP in China is 0.84 percent, compared to 1.5 to 2 percent in developed economies. We
believe that the advertising business in China has substantial room for growth. 

Our
Competitive Strengths 

Whereas
traditional leaflet advertising and elevator advertising in China is limited in reach, intrusive, traditional and monotonous, advertisements
and content on our Huobaobao backpacks are viewed in myriad settings, are iconic and inherently amusing, and the displays on the backpack
screen can be in the form of video, photos or text. We enjoy first-mover advantage in an exciting new advertising category in China. 

According
to internal Company data, the Huobaobao backpack is viewed by an average of 4.2 people for every fifteen-second advertisement that is
broadcast on its screen, which management estimates to be an increase in viewers which is two hundred times that of traditional leaflets
and five times that of elevator ads. 

We
have a professional and experienced senior management team with a proven track record. By combining our management s capability
in implementing growth strategies and our in-depth knowledge in the offline marketing and advertising industry, our management team is
confident that our company is poised to capture potential market opportunities in offline marketing and advertising segments. 

Our
Huobaobao backpacks are able to deliver ads in highly crowded spaces (eg, business districts) in an interesting and non-intrusive manner,
resulting in high engagement and broad distribution of ads. The Huobaobao backpack supports video, photo and textual content, enhancing
creativity and flexibility for advertisers. 

The
Company has a content editing team that ensures the safety, appeal and effectiveness of the content that is broadcasted on the Huobaobao
screen, ensuring that advertisements attract the attention of consumers and produce a high rate of return to brands. 

Growth
Strategy 

In
addition to sales of our Huobaobao backpack, we have initiated advertising services by directly selling and monetizing advertising on
our backpacks. Although our progress in this area was slowed by the process of updating and upgrading our backpack, the Company is intent
on growing our advertising revenue now that development of the fourth iteration backpack is complete. To ensure the quality of our business,
we enforce strict rules for potential advertisers, prohibiting advertisements that relate to drugs or which are in violation of relevant
PRC law. 

We
have noted the development of mobile advertising, digital advertising and scene advertising within the advertising industry in recent
years, and we believe that the mobile scene advertising space is an emerging and viable opportunity for our Huobaobao backpack. 

Research
and Development 

As
consumer behaviors and preferences constantly evolve, the demands from the end customers become increasingly diversified. We make significant
investments in technology to optimize our existing products and services and to develop new iterations of our backpack so that we can
expand our offerings to satisfy diversifying user demands.

Competition 

We
are subject to intense competition from providers of similar products, as well as potential new types of services and products. Our competitors
may have substantially more cash, traffic, technical, performer and other resources, as well as broader product or service offerings
and can leverage their relationships based on other products or services to gain a larger share of marketing budgets from customers.
We believe that our ability to compete effectively depends upon many factors, including our ad targeting capabilities, market acceptance
of our products, our marketing and selling efforts and the strength and reputation of our brand. We also experience significant competition
for highly skilled personnel, including management, designers, sales personnel and marketing personnel. Our growth strategy depends in
part on our ability to retain our existing personnel and add additional highly skilled employees. 

Employees 

As
of October, 2021, we have 37 full-time employees, including 9 in the technical department, 6 in the finance department, 5 in the system
operation and maintenance center, 7 in the operations department, 6 in the general management office, 3 in the human resources administration
center and 1 in the outreach department. We are compliant with local prevailing wage, contractor licensing and insurance regulations,
and have good relations with our employees. 

Corporation
Information 

Our
principal executive offices are located at Room 1703B, Zhongzhou Building, No. 3088, Jintian Road, Futian District, Shenzhen City, Guangdong
Province, People s Republic of China 518000. Our telephone number at this address is +86 755-83257679. 

Government
Regulation 

Our
Company and our advertisers are subject to the Advertising Law of the People s Republic of China (the Advertising Law ).
The Advertising Law is a national regulation that regulates various advertising matters. Its main purpose is to regulate the advertising
market and protect the rights and interests of consumers. The regulation was enacted on October 27, 1994 and formally took effect on
February 1, 1995. On November 13, 2009, the National Consumers Association of China revealed that the Advertising Law of the People s
Republic of China will be revised to include relevant regulations on celebrity endorsement advertising. The new content severely punished
celebrity endorsements and false advertising. On February 21, 2014, the Legislative Affairs Office of the State Council of China publicly
solicited opinions on the Advertising Law of the People s Republic of China (Revised Draft) (Draft for Solicitation of Comments). 
The draft for comments clearly stated that no organization or individual shall send advertisements to landline telephones, mobile phones
or personal e-mail addresses without the consent or request of the parties concerned, or if the parties expressly refuse. On April 24,
2015, the Advertising Law of the People s Republic of China was revised and passed, and it came into force on September
1, 2015.

ITEM
1A. RISK FACTORS 

Risks
Related to Our Business and Industry 

Limited
Operating History 

We
were a shell company until August 2020, and have a limited operating history and minimal revenues or earnings from operations since inception.
 You should consider our future prospects in light of the risks and uncertainties experienced
by early stage companies. Some of these risks and uncertainties relate to our ability to: 

offer
 products of sufficient quality to attract and retain a larger customer base; 

attract
 additional customers and increase spending per customer; 

increase
 awareness of our products and continue to develop customer loyalty; 

respond
 to competitive market conditions; 

respond
 to changes in our regulatory environment; 

maintain
 effective control of our costs and expenses; 

raise
 sufficient capital to sustain and expand our business; and 

attract,
 retain and motivate qualified personnel. 

If
we are unsuccessful in addressing any of these risks and uncertainties, our business may be materially and adversely affected. 

We
envision a period of rapid growth that may impose a significant burden on our administrative and operational resources, which, if not
effectively managed, could impair our growth. 

Our
strategy envisions a period of rapid growth that may impose a significant burden on our administrative and operational resources. The
growth of our business will require significant investments of capital and management s close attention. Our ability to effectively
manage our growth will require us to substantially expand the capabilities of our administrative and operational resources and to attract,
train, manage and retain qualified management, sales and marketing and other personnel; we may be unable to do so. In addition, our failure
to successfully manage our growth could result in our sales not increasing commensurately with capital investments. If we are unable
to successfully manage our growth, we may be unable to achieve our goals. 

Limited
Liability 

Our
Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws generally provide that the liability of our officers and directors will be eliminated to the
fullest extent allowed under law for their acts on behalf of the Company. 

Uncertain
Government Regulation 

Our
business is subject to extensive regulation. In addition, we may be adversely affected as a result of new or revised legislation or regulations
imposed by the SEC or other United States governmental regulatory authorities or self-regulatory organizations that supervise the markets.
We also may be adversely affected by changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and rules by these governmental authorities
and self-regulatory organizations. 

We
Use A Variety Of Raw Materials, Components And Contract Manufacturing Services In Our Businesses, And Significant Shortages, Supplier
Capacity Constraints, Supplier Production Disruptions Or Price Increases Could Increase Our Operating Costs And Adversely Impact The
Competitive Positions Of Our Products. 

Our
reliance on suppliers (including third-party manufacturing suppliers and logistics providers) and commodity markets to secure raw materials
and components used in our products exposes us to volatility in the prices and availability of these materials. A disruption in deliveries
from our suppliers, supplier capacity constraints, supplier production disruptions, supplier quality issues, closing or bankruptcy of
our suppliers, price increases or decreased availability of raw materials or commodities, could have a material adverse effect on our
ability to meet our commitments to customers or could increase our operating costs. We believe that our supply management and production
practices are based on an appropriate balancing of the foreseeable risks and the costs of alternative practices. Nonetheless, price increases,
supplier capacity constraints, supplier production disruptions or the unavailability of some raw materials may have a material adverse
effect on our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.

Economic
Conditions 

Our
business will be materially affected by conditions in the financial markets and economic conditions or events in the United States, the
PRC and throughout the world that are outside our control, including, without limitation, changes in interest rates, availability of
credit, inflation rates, economic uncertainty, changes in laws (including laws relating to taxation), trade barriers, commodity prices,
currency exchange rates and controls and national and international political circumstances (including wars, terrorist acts or security
operations). These factors may affect the level and volatility of securities prices and the liquidity and value of investments, and we
may not be able to or may choose not to manage our exposure to these market conditions and/or other events. In the event of a market
downturn, our businesses could be adversely affected in different ways. 

We
May Incur Material Product Liability Claims That Could Increase Our Costs And Harm Our Financial Condition And Operation Results. 

It
is possible that widespread product liability claims could increase our costs, and adversely affect our revenues and operating income.
Moreover, liability claims arising from a serious adverse event may increase our costs through higher insurance premiums and deductibles,
and may make it more difficult to secure adequate insurance coverage in the future. In addition, as we do not maintain product liability
insurance, we will be responsible to cover future product liability claims, thereby requiring us to pay substantial monetary damages
and adversely affecting our business. We haven t had any incident wherein damages were reported and determined to be caused by
our products. 

Implications
Of Being An Emerging Growth Company 

As
a company with less than 1,070,000,000 billion in annual gross revenue during its last fiscal year, we qualify as an emerging
growth company as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (the JOBS Act ). For as long as a company is
deemed to be an emerging growth company, it may take advantage of specified reduced reporting and other regulatory requirements that
are generally unavailable to other public companies. These provisions include: 

a
 requirement to have only two years of audited financial statements and only two years of related Management s Discussion and
 Analysis included in an initial public offering registration statement; 

an
 exemption to provide less than five years of selected financial data in an initial public offering registration statement; 

an
 exemption from the auditor attestation requirement in the assessment of our internal controls over financial reporting; 

an
 exemption from the adoption of new or revised financial accounting standards until they would apply to private companies; 

an
 exemption from compliance with any new requirements adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board requiring mandatory
 audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor s report in which the auditor would be required to provide additional information
 about the audit and the financial statements of the issuer; and 

reduced
 disclosure about our executive compensation arrangements. 

An
emerging growth company is also exempt from Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes Oxley Act, which requires that the registered accounting firm
shall attest to and report on the assessment of the effectiveness of the internal control structure and procedures for financial reporting.
Similarly, as a smaller reporting company we are exempt from Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and our independent registered
public accounting firm will not be required to formally attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting
until such time as we cease being a smaller reporting company. 

12 

As
an emerging growth company, we are exempt from Section 14A (a) and (b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act ),
which require stockholder approval of executive compensation and golden parachutes. 

Section
107 of the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section
7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging growth company can
delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected
to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period. Our financial statements may therefore not be comparable to those
of companies that comply with such new or revised accounting standards. 

We
would cease to be an emerging growth company upon the earliest of: 

the
 first fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the completion of our initial public offering; 

the
 first fiscal year after our annual gross revenues are 1.07 billion or more; 

the
 date on which we have, during the previous three-year period, issued more than 1 billion in non-convertible debt securities; or 

as
 of the end of any fiscal year in which the market value of our Common Stock held by non-affiliates exceeded 700 million as of the
 end of the second quarter of that fiscal year. 

We
Have Identified Material Weaknesses In Our Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. If We Fail To Maintain An Effective System Of Internal
Control Over Financial Reporting, We May Not Be Able To Accurately Report Our Financial Results Or Prevent Fraud. As A Result, Stockholders
Could Lose Confidence In Our Financial And Other Public Reporting, Which Would Harm Our Business And The Trading Price Of Our Shares. 

Effective
internal control over financial reporting is necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and, together with adequate disclosure
controls and procedures, are designed to prevent fraud. Any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or difficulties encountered
in their implementation, could cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. Ineffective internal control could also cause investors
to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our shares. 

We
have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting in the Company and in Mu Yan Samoa and its subsidiaries.
As defined in Regulation 12b-2 under the Exchange Act, a material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies,
in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual
or interim consolidated financial statements will not be prevented, or detected on a timely basis. Specifically, we determined that we
had the following material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting: (i) we have limited controls over information
processing; (ii) we have inadequate segregation of duties; (iii) we do not have a formal audit committee with a financial expert; and
(iv) we do not have sufficient formal written policies and procedures for accounting and financial reporting with respect to the requirements
and application of both generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America, or GAAP, and SEC guidelines. Although
the financial statements and footnotes are reviewed by our management, we do not have a formal policy to review significant accounting
transactions and the accounting treatment of such transactions. 

13 

Even
if we develop effective internal controls over financial reporting, such controls may become inadequate due to changes in conditions,
or the degree of compliance with such policies or procedures may deteriorate, which could result in the discovery of additional material
weaknesses and deficiencies. In any event, the process of determining whether our existing internal control over financial reporting
is compliant with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act Section 404 and is sufficiently effective requires the investment
of substantial time and resources by our senior management. As a result, this process may divert internal resources and take a significant
amount of time and effort to complete. In addition, we cannot predict the outcome of this process and whether we will need to implement
remedial actions in order to establish effective controls over financial reporting. The determination of whether or not our internal
controls are sufficient, and any remedial actions required could result in us incurring additional costs that we did not anticipate,
including the hiring of additional outside consultants. We may also fail to timely complete our evaluation, testing and any remediation
required to comply with Section 404. 

We
are required, pursuant to Section 404, to furnish a report by management on, among other things, the effectiveness of our internal control
over financial reporting. However, for as long as we are a smaller reporting company, our independent registered public
accounting firm will not be required to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section
404. While we could be a smaller reporting company for an indefinite amount of time, and thus relieved of the above-mentioned attestation
requirement, an independent assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting could detect problems that
our management s assessment might not. Such undetected material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting could
lead to financial statement restatements and require us to incur the expense of remediation. 

Rising
Competition May Materially Affect Our Operations And Financial Condition 

We
operate in a highly competitive and rapidly evolving field, and new developments are expected to continue at a rapid pace. Competitors
may succeed by expanding their capacity or succeed in developing products that are more efficient, easier to use or less expensive than
those which have been or are being developed by us that would render our technology and products obsolete and non-competitive. Any of
these actions by our competitors could adversely affect our sales. 

Additionally,
several companies are developing similar and substitute products to address the same LED backpack field that we are targeting. These
competitors may have greater financial and technical resources, productivity and marketing capabilities and facilities and human resources,
or they may have a better quality of products, service and production cycle. The competition from these competitors may adversely affect
our business. 

An
increase in competition could result in material selling price reductions or loss of our market share, which could have an adverse material
impact on our operations and financial condition. 

Negative
Publicity May Harm Our Reputation And Have A Material Adverse Effect On Our Business And Operating Results. 

Negative
publicity involving us, our customers, our management, distributors or our business model may materially and adversely harm our business.
We cannot assure you that we will be able to defuse negative publicity about us, our management and/or our products to the satisfaction
of our investors, customers and distributors. Such negative publicity, especially when it is directly addressed against us or our products,
may also require us to engage in defensive media campaigns. This may cause us to increase our marketing expenses and divert our management s
attention and may adversely impact our business and results of operations. 

The
Continuing And Collaborative Efforts Of Our Senior Management And Key Employees Are Crucial To Our Success, And Our Business May Be Harmed
If We Were To Lose Their Services. 

We
depend on the continued contributions of our senior management, especially the executive officers listed in the Management 
section of this report, and other key employees, many of whom are difficult to replace. The loss of the services of any of our executive
officers or other key employees could materially harm our business. Competition for qualified talent in the market is intense. Our future
success is dependent on our ability to attract a significant number of qualified employees and retain existing key employees. If we are
unable to do so, our business and growth may be materially and adversely affected. Our need to significantly increase the number of our
qualified employees and to retain key employees may cause us to materially increase compensation-related costs, including stock-based
compensation. 

14 

We
May Not Be Able To Adequately Protect Our Intellectual Property, Which Could Cause Us To Be Less Competitive And Third-Party Infringements
Of Our Intellectual Property Rights May Adversely Affect Our Business. 

We
rely on a combination of copyright, trademark and trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure to protect our intellectual property
rights. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, third parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain and use our intellectual
property or seek court declarations that they do not infringe upon our intellectual property rights. Monitoring unauthorized use of our
intellectual property is difficult and costly, and we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent misappropriation of
our intellectual property. From time to time, we may have to resort to litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights, which
could result in substantial costs and diversion of our resources. 

We
May Be Subject To Intellectual Property Infringement Claims Or Other Allegations By Third Parties For Information Or Content Displayed
On Our Products, Or Distributed To Our Customers, Which May Materially And Adversely Affect Our Business, Financial Condition And Prospects. 

We
may in the future be subject to intellectual property infringement claims or other allegations by third parties for products and services
we provide or for information or content displayed on our product, or distributed to our end customers, which may materially and adversely
affect our business, financial condition and prospects. Defending intellectual property litigation is costly and can impose a significant
burden on our management and employees, and there can be no assurances that favorable final outcomes will be obtained in all cases. Such
claims, even if they do not result in liability, may harm our reputation. Any resulting liability or expenses, or changes required to
our platform to reduce the risk of future liability, may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and prospects. 

Performance
Of Our Products Depends On The Performance Of The Internet Infrastructure And Fixed Telecommunications Networks. 

We
primarily rely on a limited number of telecommunication service providers to provide our end customers with data communications capacity
through local telecommunications lines and Internet data centers to control the LED screen of our products. Our end customers have limited
access to alternative networks or services in the event of disruptions, failures or other problems with Internet infrastructure or the
fixed telecommunications networks provided by telecommunication service providers. 

Our
Business Operations May Be Adversely Affected By The Outbreak Of Coronavirus COVID-19 Or Future Epidemics Or Pandemics. 

In
December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus COVID-19 was reported in Wuhan, China. On March 11, 2020, the World Health
Organization categorized it as a pandemic. To reduce the spread of COVID-19, the Chinese government employed measures including city
lockdowns, quarantines, travel restrictions, suspension of business activities and school closures. 

The
COVID-19 pandemic significantly disrupted China s economy in the first quarter of 2020. Despite the PRC government s efforts
to revive China s economy, China s economy experienced a significant slowdown since the outbreak and will continue to face
new difficulties and challenges due to the spread of the pandemic, increasing risk of imported cases and heightened volatility and uncertainties
in the global economy, and there remains uncertainty as to how soon or whether economic activities in China will rebound to the level
prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. 

15 

Our
business has been and may continue to be adversely impacted. Our sole operating subsidiary is located in China, as are its employees,
contract manufacturers and customers. Measures taken in China to control the virus, such as lockdowns, negated the value of our method
of advertising. From February to April 2020, people were advised to stay at home as much as possible and to avoid public places and crowds.
It is likely that these factors, in addition to temporary closures of non-essential retail establishments, negatively impacted sales
of our backpacks during the fiscal year ended July 31, 2020. However, since our operating subsidiary, Mu Yan Shenzhen, was formed in
September 2019 and did not commence sales of the Huobaobao backpack until January 2020, we have no comparable revenue data for a prior
fiscal year, making it impossible to quantify or accurately assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business. 

The
potential downturn brought by and the duration of the COVID-19 outbreak is difficult to assess or predict and the full impact of the
virus on our operations will depend on many factors beyond our control. A slowdown in the Chinese economy and/or negative business sentiment
could potentially have a significant negative impact on our revenues since companies might be expected to reduce their advertising budgets.
A major resurgence of the epidemic in China could be expected to significantly reduce the demand for our products. In addition, our business
operations could be disrupted again if any of our employees, or our manufacturers employees, is suspected of contracting COVID-19,
since all employees could be quarantined and/or facilities shut down for disinfection. The extent to which the COVID-19 outbreak impacts
our business, results of operations and financial condition remains uncertain. Our business, results of operations, financial condition
and prospects could be materially adversely affected to the extent that COVID-19 persists in China or harms the Chinese and global economies
in general. 

We
may also experience negative effects from future public health crises beyond our control. These events are impossible to forecast, their
negative effects may be difficult to mitigate and they could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

Risks
Associated with Doing Business in the PRC 

We
Derive All Of Our Sales From The PRC. 

All
of our sales are generated from China. We anticipate that sales of our products in China will continue to represent at least the majority
of our total sales in the near future. Any significant decline in the condition of the PRC economy could adversely affect consumer demand
for our products, among other things, which in turn would have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. 

Future
Inflation In China May Inhibit Our Activity To Conduct Business In China. 

In
recent years, the Chinese economy has experienced periods of rapid expansion and high rates of inflation. During the past ten years,
the rate of inflation in China has been as high as 20.7 and as low as - 2.2 (Source: http://www.stats.gov.cn/) These factors have led
to the adoption by the Chinese government, from time to time, of various corrective measures designed to restrict the availability of
credit or regulate growth and contain inflation. High inflation may in the future cause the Chinese government to impose controls on
credit and/or prices, or to take other action, which could inhibit economic activity in China, and thereby harm the market for our products. 

Fluctuations
In Exchange Rates Could Adversely Affect Our Business And The Value Of Our Securities. 

The
value of the Chinese Yuan CNY or RMB against the U.S. dollar and other currencies may fluctuate and is
affected by, among other things, changes in China s political and economic conditions and foreign exchange policies. On July 21,
2005, the PRC government changed its decade-old policy of pegging the value of the RMB to the U.S. dollar. Under the revised policy,
the RMB is permitted to fluctuate within a narrow and managed band against a basket of certain foreign currencies. The RMB appreciated
more than 20 against the U.S. dollar over the three years following the removal of the U.S. dollar peg. Since July 2008, however, the
RMB has traded within a narrow range against the U.S. dollar. It is difficult to predict how long the current situation may last and
when and how the RMB exchange rates may change going forward. 

16 

Our
revenues and costs are mostly denominated in RMB, while a significant portion of our financial assets are denominated in U.S. dollars.
At the holding company level, we rely entirely on dividends and other fees paid to us by our subsidiaries and consolidated affiliated
entities in China. Any significant revaluation of RMB may materially and adversely affect our cash flows, revenues, earnings and financial
position. For example, an appreciation of RMB against the U.S. dollar would make any new RMB denominated investments or expenditures
more costly to us to the extent that we need to convert U.S. dollars into RMB for such purposes. An appreciation of RMB against the U.S.
dollar would also result in foreign currency translation losses for financial reporting purposes when we translate our U.S. dollar denominated
financial assets into RMB, as RMB is our reporting currency. Conversely, a significant depreciation of the RMB against the U.S. dollar
may significantly reduce the U.S. dollar equivalent of our earnings, which in turn could adversely affect the price of our Common Stock. 

We
May Rely On Dividends And Other Distributions On Equity Paid By Our PRC Subsidiaries To Fund Any Cash And Financing Requirements We May
Have, And Any Limitation On The Ability Of Our PRC Subsidiaries To Make Payments To Us Could Have A Material And Adverse Effect On Our
Ability To Conduct Our Business. 

We
are a Nevada holding company and we rely principally on dividends and other distributions on equity from our PRC subsidiaries for our
cash requirements, including for servicing any debt we may incur. Our PRC subsidiaries ability to distribute dividends is based
upon their distributable earnings. Current PRC regulations permit our PRC subsidiaries to pay dividends to their respective shareholders
only out of their accumulated profits, if any, determined in accordance with PRC accounting standards and regulations. In addition, our
PRC subsidiaries are required to set aside at least 10 of their after-tax profits each year, if any, to fund a statutory reserve until
such reserve reaches 50 of their registered capital. Our PRC subsidiaries, as foreign invested enterprises, or FIEs, are also required
to further set aside a portion of their after-tax profit to fund an employee welfare fund, although the amount to be set aside, if any,
is determined at their discretion. These reserves are not distributable as cash dividends. If our PRC subsidiaries incur debt on their
own behalf in the future, the instruments governing the debt may restrict their ability to pay dividends or make other payments to us.
Any limitation on the ability of our PRC subsidiaries to distribute dividends or other payments to their shareholders could materially
and adversely limit our ability to grow, make investments or acquisitions that could be beneficial to our business, pay dividends or
otherwise fund and conduct our business. 

To
The Extent That Our Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm s Audit Documentation Related To Their Audit Reports For The
Company Are, Or Will Be, Located In China, The PCAOB May Not Be Able To Inspect Such Audit Documentation And, As A Result, You May Be
Deprived Of The Benefits Of Such Inspection. 

Our
independent registered public accounting firm issued audit opinions on the financial statements included in this Annual Report and will
issue audit reports related to the Company in the future. As the auditor of a company filing reports with the SEC and as a firm registered
with the PCAOB, our auditor is required by the laws of the United States to undergo regular inspections by the PCAOB. However, to the
extent that our auditor s work papers are or become located in China, such work papers will not be subject to inspection by the
PCAOB because the PCAOB is currently unable to conduct inspections without the approval of the Chinese authorities. Inspections of certain
other firms that the PCAOB has conducted outside of China have identified deficiencies in those firms audit procedures and quality
control procedures, which may be addressed as part of the inspection process to improve future audit quality. The inability of the PCAOB
to conduct inspections of our auditor s work papers in China would make it more difficult to evaluate the effectiveness of our
auditor s audit procedures or quality control procedures as compared to auditors outside of China that are subject to PCAOB inspections.
Investors may consequently lose confidence in our reported financial information and procedures and the quality of our financial statements.
As a result, our investors may be deprived of the benefits of the PCAOB s oversight of our auditors through such inspections. 

17 

In
addition, trade tensions and policy changes between China and the United States have also led to measures that could have adverse effects
on China-based issuers, including proposed legislation in the United States that would require listed companies whose audit reports and/or
auditors are not subject to review by the PCAOB to be subject to enhanced disclosure obligations and be subject to delisting if they
do not comply with the requirements. If our auditor is sanctioned or otherwise penalized by the PCAOB or the SEC as a result of failure
to comply with inspection or investigation requirements, our financial statements could be determined to be not in compliance with the
requirements of the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act or other laws or rules in the United States,
which could ultimately result in our Common Stock being delisted from whatever exchange it may become listed on. 

Risks
Related to Our Shares 

The
OTC And Share Value 

Our
Common Stock trades over the counter, which may deprive stockholders of the full value of their shares. Our stock is quoted via the Over-The-Counter OTC Pink Sheets under the ticker symbol MYTG. Therefore, our Common Stock is expected to have fewer market
makers, lower trading volumes and larger spreads between bid and asked prices than securities listed on an exchange such as the New York
Stock Exchange or the NASDAQ Stock Market. These factors may result in higher price volatility and less market liquidity for our Common
Stock. 

Low
Market Price 

A
low market price would severely limit the potential market for our Common Stock. Our Common Stock is expected to trade at a price below
 5.00 per share, subjecting trading in the stock to certain SEC rules requiring additional disclosures by broker-dealers. These rules
generally apply to any non-NASDAQ equity security that has a market price share of less than 5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions
(a penny stock ). Such rules require the delivery, prior to any penny stock transaction, of a disclosure schedule explaining
the penny stock market and the risks associated therewith and impose various sales practice requirements on broker-dealers who sell penny
stocks to persons other than established customers and institutional or wealthy investors. For these types of transactions, the broker-dealer
must make a special suitability determination for the purchaser and have received the purchaser s written consent to the transaction
prior to the sale. The broker-dealer also must disclose the commissions payable to the broker-dealer, current bid and offer quotations
for the penny stock and, if the broker-dealer is the sole market maker, the broker-dealer must disclose this fact and the broker-dealer s
presumed control over the market. Such information must be provided to the customer orally or in writing before or with the written confirmation
of trade sent to the customer. Monthly statements must be sent disclosing recent price information for the penny stock held in the account
and information on the limited market in penny stocks. The additional burdens imposed upon broker-dealers by such requirements could
discourage broker-dealers from effecting transactions in our Common Stock. 

Lack
Of Market And State Blue Sky Laws 

Investors
may have difficulty in reselling their shares due to the lack of market or state Blue Sky laws. The holders of our shares of Common Stock
and persons who desire to purchase them in any trading market that might develop in the future should be aware that there may be significant
state law restrictions upon the ability of investors to resell our shares. Accordingly, even though our shares are quoted on the OTC
Market, investors should consider any secondary market for our securities to be a limited one. We intend to seek coverage and publication
of information regarding our Company in an accepted publication that permits a manual exemption. This manual exemption
permits a security to be distributed in a particular state without being registered if the company issuing the security has a listing
for that security in a securities manual recognized by the state. However, it is not enough for the security to be listed in a recognized
manual. The listing entry must contain (1) the names of issuers, officers and directors, (2) an issuer s balance sheet, and (3)
a profit and loss statement for either the fiscal year preceding the balance sheet or for the most recent fiscal year of operations.
We may not be able to secure a listing containing all of this information. Furthermore, the manual exemption is a non-issuer exemption
restricted to secondary trading transactions, making it unavailable for issuers selling newly issued securities. Most of the accepted
manuals are those published in Standard and Poor s, Mergent s, Fitch s Investment Service and Best s Insurance
Reports, and many states expressly recognize these manuals. A smaller number of states declare that they recognize securities
manuals but do not specify the recognized manuals. The following states do not have any provisions and therefore do not expressly
recognize the manual exemption: Alabama, Georgia, Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana, Montana, South Dakota, Tennessee, Vermont and Wisconsin. 

18 

Penny
Stock Regulations 

We
are subject to penny stock regulations and restrictions and you may have difficulty selling shares of our Common Stock. The SEC has adopted
regulations which generally define so-called penny stocks to be an equity security that has a market price less than 5.00
per share or an exercise price of less than 5.00 per share, subject to certain exemptions. Our Common Stock is currently a penny
stock, and we are subject to Rule 15g-9 under the Exchange Act, or the Penny Stock Rule. This rule imposes additional
sales practice requirements on broker-dealers that sell such securities to persons other than established customers. For transactions
covered by Rule 15g-9, a broker- dealer must make a special suitability determination for the purchaser and have received the purchaser s
written consent to the transaction prior to sale. As a result, this rule may affect the ability of broker-dealers to sell our securities
and may affect the ability of purchasers to sell any of our securities in the secondary market. 

For
any transaction involving a penny stock, unless exempt, the rules require delivery, prior to any transaction in a penny stock, of a disclosure
schedule prepared by the SEC relating to the penny stock market. Disclosure is also required to be made about sales commissions payable
to both the broker-dealer and the registered representative and current quotations for the securities. Finally, monthly statements are
required to be sent disclosing recent price information for the penny stock held in the account and information on the limited market
in penny stock. 

We
do not qualify for exemption from the Penny Stock Rule. In any event, even if our Common Stock were exempt from the Penny Stock Rule,
we would remain subject to Section 15(b)(6) of the Exchange Act, which gives the SEC the authority to restrict any person from participating
in a distribution of penny stock, if the SEC finds that such a restriction would be in the public interest. 

Rule
144 Risks 

Sales
of our Common Stock under Rule 144 could reduce the price of our stock. Issued and outstanding shares of our Common Stock that Rule 144
of the Securities Act defines as restricted securities will be subject to the resale restrictions of Rule 144. In general, persons holding
restricted securities, including affiliates, must hold their shares for a period of at least six months, may not sell more than 1.0 
of the total issued and outstanding shares in any 90-day period and must resell the shares in an unsolicited brokerage transaction at
the market price. The availability for sale of substantial amounts of Common Stock under Rule 144 could reduce prevailing market prices
for our securities. 

No
Audit Or Compensation Committee 

Because
we do not have an audit or compensation committee, stockholders will have to rely on our directors, who are not independent, to perform
these functions. Thus, there is a potential conflict in that our directors, who are also part of management, will determine management
compensation and audit issues that may affect management decisions. 

Security
Laws Exposure 

We
are subject to compliance with securities laws, which exposes us to potential liabilities, including potential rescission rights. We
may offer to sell shares of our Common Stock to investors pursuant to certain exemptions from the registration requirements of the Securities
Act, as well as those of various state securities laws. The basis for relying on such exemptions is factual; that is, the applicability
of such exemptions depends upon our conduct and that of those persons contacting prospective investors and making the offering. We may
not seek any legal opinion to the effect that any such offering would be exempt from registration under any federal or state law. Instead,
we may elect to rely upon the operative facts as the basis for such exemption, including information provided by investors themselves. 

19 

If
any such offering did not qualify for such exemption, an investor would have the right to rescind its purchase of the securities if it
so desired. It is possible that if an investor should seek rescission, such investor would succeed. A similar situation prevails under
state law in those states where the securities may be offered without registration in reliance on the partial pre-emption from the registration
or qualification provisions of such state statutes under the National Securities Markets Improvement Act of 1996. If investors were successful
in seeking rescission, we would face severe financial demands that could adversely affect our business and operations. Additionally,
if we did not in fact qualify for the exemptions upon which we have relied, we may become subject to significant fines and penalties
imposed by the SEC and state securities agencies. 

No
Cash Dividends 

Because
we do not intend to pay any cash dividends on our Common Stock, our stockholders will not be able to receive a return on their shares
unless they sell them. We intend to retain any future earnings to finance the development and expansion of our business for the foreseeable
future. There is no assurance that stockholders will be able to sell shares of our Common Stock when desired. 

Reduced
Reporting Requirements For Emerging Growth Companies 

We
are an emerging growth company, as defined in the JOBS Act and take advantage of certain exemptions from various requirements
applicable to other reporting companies that are not emerging growth companies including, most significantly, not being required to comply
with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for so long as we are an emerging growth company.
As a result, if we elect not to comply with such auditor attestation requirements, our investors may not have access to certain information
they may deem important. 

The
JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company does not need to comply with any new or revised financial accounting standards
until such date that a private company is otherwise required to comply with such new or revised financial accounting standards. The Company
has elected to use the extended transition period for complying with new or revised financial accounting standards under Section 102(b)(2)
of the JOBS Act that allows the Company to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates
for public and private companies until those standards apply to private companies.

7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

The
following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated
financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this report. Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared
in accordance with U.S. GAAP. In addition, our consolidated financial statements and the financial data included in this Annual Report
reflect our reorganization and have been prepared as if our current corporate structure had been in place throughout the relevant periods.
The following discussion and analysis contain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ
materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. For additional information regarding these risks and uncertainties,
please see Risk Factors. 

Overview 

The
Company was originally incorporated in Nevada under the name Lepota Inc. on December 9, 2013. It maintains its principal
executive offices at Room 1703B, Zhongzhou Building, No. 3088 Jintian Road, Futian District, Shenzhen
City, Guangdong Province, People s Republic of China 518000 . The Company was formed for the purpose of importing and distributing
cosmetics into the Russian Federation. 

The
Company filed a registration statement on Form S-1 with the SEC on September 18, 2014, which was declared effective on May 4, 2016. However,
because the Company did not identify a viable business
model or engage in any business prior to the Share Exchange, it was a shell company until August 12, 2020. 

On
February 18, 2020, as a result of a private transaction, 5,000,000 shares of the Company s Common Stock were transferred from Rene
Lawrence, its controlling shareholder, to certain purchasers (the Purchasers ), with Zhao Lixin, the Company s current
CEO, becoming a 53.8 holder of the voting rights of the Company, and the Purchasers becoming the controlling shareholders. As a result
of the change of control, Iurii Iurtaev resigned as the Company s president, chief executive officer, chief financial officer and
director and Rene Lawrence resigned as the Company s secretary. Zhao Lixin was then named President, Chief Executive Officer, Chief
Financial Officer, Treasurer, Secretary and Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Company. 

On
August 12, 2020 (the Closing Date ), the Company closed on the Share Exchange with Mu Yan Samoa and the Mu Yan Shareholders.
As a result, Mu Yan Samoa is now a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. Under the Share Exchange Agreement, the Mu Yan Shareholders
exchanged 100 of the outstanding shares of Mu Yan Samoa s common stock for 300,000,000 shares of the Company s Common Stock.
As a result of the Share Exchange, effective September 22, 2020, the Company s name was changed to Mu Yan Technology Group Co.,
Limited. 

For
accounting purposes, the Share Exchange was treated as a recapitalization of the Company with Mu Yan Samoa as the acquirer. When we refer
in this Annual Report to business and financial information for periods prior to the consummation of the Share Exchange, we are referring
to the business and financial information of Mu Yan Samoa unless the context suggests otherwise. 

22 

As
a result of the closing of the Share Exchange, the Mu Yan Shareholders own approximately 98 of the total outstanding common shares of
the Company and the former shareholders of the Company own approximately 2 . The shares issued to the Mu Yan Shareholders in connection
with the Share Exchange were not registered under the Securities Act in reliance upon the exemption from registration provided by Section
4(a)(2) of the Securities Act, which exempts transactions by an issuer not involving any public offering. These securities may not be
offered or sold absent registration or an applicable exemption from the registration requirement. 

As
a result of the recapitalization described above, management of the Company believes that the Company is no longer a shell company. The
Company s operations now consist of the operations of Mu Yan Samoa and its subsidiaries. 

Since
our operating subsidiary, Mu Yan Shenzhen, was formed in September 2019 and did not commence sales of the Huobaobao backpack until January
2020, we have no comparable revenue data for a prior fiscal year, making it impossible to quantify or accurately assess the impact of
the COVID-19 pandemic on our revenues for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2020. However, management believes that the pandemic did negatively
impact our results of operations for that fiscal year. 

Throughout
the remainder of this Annual Report, when we use phrases such as we, our, Company and us, 
we are referring to the Company and all of its subsidiaries, as a combined entity.

The
following summarizes our results of operations for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2021 and the fiscal year ended July 31, 2020. The table

Revenue 

Revenue
generated from selling our mobile advertisement backpack contributed 5,926,274 and 9,050,811 to our total revenue for the fiscal years
ended July 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The decrease in revenue for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2021 was due to a significant
decrease in the number of mobile advertisement backpacks sold during the fiscal year ended July 31, 2021 as a result of the suspension
of sales while the Company worked on upgrading and updating the hardware and the software utilized in the backpack as well as a shortage
of raw materials.. 

Revenue
generated from advertising services contributed 334,889 and Nil to our total revenue for the year ended July 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
The increase in revenue from advertising services was due to the fact that the Company did not commence operations in this business segment
until December 2020. 

Total
revenue for the years ended July 31, 2021 and 2020 were 6,261,163 and 9,050,811, respectively.

Cost
of revenue for mobile advertisement backpack for the years ended July 31, 2021 and 2020 was 2,560,674 and 3,113,151, respectively.
The significant decrease in cost of revenue was a result of our having sold 15,252 mobile advertisement backpacks during the year ended
July 31, 2021 compared to 17,648 backpacks having been sold during the year ended July 31, 2020. 

For
our mobile advertisement backpack business, we outsourced the assembly processes of our products to subcontractors, and we maintained
stable relationships with them. We outsource our delivery services to two courier companies. Delivery fees are paid by the ultimate customers
upon delivery of the products. We have not experienced difficulty in obtaining inventory for our business, and we believe we maintain
good relationships with our suppliers. 

Inventory
costs for our mobile advertisement backpack business were 43.2 of our total mobile advertisement backpack business revenue in the year
ended July 31, 2021, compared with 34.4 in the year ended July 31, 2020. The increased percentage was mainly due to a 50 reduction
in the selling price of our mobile advertisement backpacks due to a promotion from September 2020 to November 2020. 

Cost
of revenue for advertising services for the years ended July 31, 2021 and 2020 was 73,671 and Nil, respectively. The increase in cost
of revenue for advertising services was due to the fact that the Company did not commence sales in this business segment until December
2020. 

For
our advertising services business, we outsource some of the business to our contractors. Labor fees, which amounted to 8,530 for the
year ended July 31, 2021 and Nil for the year ended July 31, 2020, represented approximately 11.6 and Nil of total cost of revenues
for our advertising services segment for the years ended July 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Marketing fees, which amounted to 65,141
for the year ended July 31, 2021 and Nil for the year ended July 31, 2020, represented approximately 88.4 and Nil of total cost of
revenues for our advertising services segment for the years ended July 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. 

24 

Labor
costs for our service business accounted for 2.5 of our total service revenue for the year ended July 31, 2021, compared with Nil for
the year ended July 31, 2020. Marketing costs for our service business accounted for 19.5 of our total service revenue for the year
ended July 31, 2021, compared with Nil for the year ended July 31, 2020. 

Total
cost of revenue for the year ended July 31, 2021 was 2,634,345 compared with 3,113,151 for the year ended July 31, 2020. Total cost
of revenue as a percentage for the year ended July 31, 2021 was 42.1 , compared with 34.4 for the year ended July 31, 2020. Gross profit

Gross
profit for our mobile advertisement backpack for the year ended July 31, 2021 and the year ended July 31, 2020 were 3,365,600 and 5,937,660,
respectively. Gross profit margins for our mobile advertisement backpack for the year ended July 31, 2021 and the year ended July 31,
2020 were 56.8 and 65.6 , respectively. The decrease in gross profit margin was principally due to a promotion in which the selling
price of the backpacks was reduced by 50 from September 2020 to November 2020, and a further reduction in revenue that resulted from
reduced sales while the Company worked on upgrading and updating the hardware and the software utilized in the mobile advertisement backpack.
Management believes that, now that the upgrades and updates have been completed, the Company s dependence upon third party suppliers
will decrease and unit savings in production will be realized. 

Gross
profit for advertising services for the year ended July 31, 2021 and the year ended July 31, 2020 were 261,218 and Nil , respectively.
Gross profit margins for advertising services for the year ended July 31, 2021 and the year ended July 31, 2020 were 78 and Nil, respectively.
The increase in gross profit margin for advertising services was due to the fact that the Company did not commence sales in this business
segment until December 2020.

selling and marketing expenses for the years ended July 31, 2021 and 2020 were 637,856 and 904,192, respectively. Selling and marketing
expenses during both of those years consisted primarily of marketing expenses. The decrease in selling and marketing expenses from the
year ended July 31, 2020 to the year ended July 31, 2021 was primarily attributable to a decrease in selling expenses related to our
mobile advertisement backpack due to a reduction in sales of that product. During the year ended July 31, 2021, we sold 15,252 backpacks,
whereas during the year ended July 31, 2020, we sold 17,648. 

General
and Administrative Expenses

general and administrative expenses for the year ended July 31, 2021 and 2020 were 1,803,010 and 900,761, respectively. General and
administrative expenses consisted primarily of administrative payroll, office expense, depreciation charges and other office expenses
that are not directly attributable to our revenues. The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to
business entertainment expense incurred to maintain business relationships with cooperative partners on our mobile advertisement backpack
while the Company worked on upgrading and updating the hardware and the software utilized in the mobile advertisement backpack. 

Research
and Development Expenses 

Our
research and development expenses for the fiscal years ended July 31, 2021 and 2020 were 526,646 and 322,839, respectively. Research

or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses,
results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. 

Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates 

We
prepare our financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP, which requires management to make certain estimates and apply judgments.
We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience, current trends and other factors that management believes to be important
at the time the financial statements are prepared. On a regular basis, we review our accounting policies and how they are applied and
disclosed in our consolidated financial statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates made by management. 

We
believe that of our significant accounting policies, which are described in note 2 to our financial statements, the following accounting
policies involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity. Accordingly, these are the policies we believe are the most critical to
aid in fully understanding and evaluating our financial condition and results of operations. 

Recently
Issued and Adopted Accounting Pronouncements 

In
February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). The guidance supersedes existing guidance on accounting for leases with
the main difference being that operating leases are to be recorded in the statement of financial position as right-of-use assets and
lease liabilities, initially measured at the present value of the lease payments. For operating leases with a term of 12 months or less,
a lessee is permitted to make an accounting policy election not to recognize lease assets and liabilities. For public business entities,
the guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early
application of the guidance is permitted. In transition, entities are required to recognize and measure leases at the beginning of the
earliest period presented using a modified retrospective approach. Mu Yan Shenzhen leased an office in Shenzhen, PRC, under an operating
lease which will terminate in 2022; hence, adoption of this standard by the Company resulted in the recognition of right-of-use assets
of 8,825 and operating lease liabilities of 368,896 for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2021. 

27 

In
June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments Credit Losses (Topic 326), Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial
Statements. This ASU requires a financial asset (or group of financial assets) measured at amortized cost basis to be presented at the
net amount expected to be collected. The allowance for credit losses is a valuation account that is deducted from the amortized cost
basis of the financial asset(s) to present the net carrying value at the amount expected to be collected on the financial asset. This
Accounting Standards Update affects entities holding financial assets and net investment in leases that are not accounted for at fair
value through net income. The amendments affect loans, debt securities, trade receivables, net investments in leases, off balance sheet
credit exposures, reinsurance receivables, and any other financial assets not excluded from the scope that have the contractual right
to receive cash. For public business entities, the amendments in this Update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December
15, 2022, including interim periods within those fiscal years. All entities may adopt the amendments in this Update through a cumulative-effect
adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance is effective (that is, a modified-retrospective
approach). The Company is in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption of this pronouncement on its financial statements. 

The
Company reviews new accounting standards as issued. Management has not identified any other new standards that it believes will have
a significant impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements.

REPORT
OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

To
the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Mu Yan Technology Group Co., Limited: 

Opinion
on the Financial Statements 

We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Mu Yan Technology Group Co., Limited together with its subsidiaries the
Company as of July 31, 2021, and the related consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income, stockholders 
equity, and cash flows for the period then ended, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements ).
In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of July 31,
2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the period then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States. 

Basis
for Opinion 

These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s
financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal
securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company
is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audit
we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion
on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our
audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or
fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audit provides
a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

Emphasis
of Matter 

The
Company has significant transactions with related parties, which are described in Note 10 to the financial statements. Transactions involving
related parties cannot be presumed to be carried out on an arm s length basis, as the requisite conditions of competitive, free
market dealings may not exist.

The
full realization of the tax benefit associated with a carry forward depends predominantly upon the Company s ability to generate
taxable income during the carry forward period. 

In
assessing the realization of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of
the deferred tax assets will be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future
taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal
of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. A valuation allowance
is provided for deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not these items will either expire before the Company is able to realize
their benefits, or that future deductibility is uncertain.

and operating lease liabilities of . 

The
adoption of the new lease guidance did not have a material impact on the Company s results of operations or liquidity but resulted
in the recognition of operating lease liabilities and operating lease right-of-use assets on its balance sheets. Right-of-use ROU assets represent the right to use an underlying asset for the lease term, and lease liabilities represent the obligation to make lease
payments arising from the lease. ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the estimated present
value of lease payments over the lease term. The Company has a lease for the office in Shenzhen, PRC, under an operating lease , which is classified as an operating lease. There are no residual value guarantees and no restrictions or covenants imposed
by the lease. Rent expense for the year ended July 31, 2021 and the year ended July 31, 2020 were and , respectively.
Cash paid for the operating lease was included in the operating cash flows. 

There

of right-of-use assets, in current operating lease liabilities and Nil in non-current operating lease liabilities. 

Significant
assumptions and judgments made as part of the adoption of this new lease standard include determining (i) whether a contract contains
a lease, (ii) whether a contract involves an identified asset, and (iii) which party to the contract directs the use of the asset. The
discount rates used to calculate the present value of lease payments were determined based on hypothetical borrowing rates available
to the Company over terms similar to the lease terms.

9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE 

On
June 10, 2020, the Company dismissed Jorgensen Co. Jorgensen as our independent registered public accounting firm.
The reports of Jorgensen on our financial statements for the fiscal years ended July 31, 2019 and 2018 did not contain an adverse opinion
or disclaimer of opinion, and they were not qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope or accounting principles, except that
such reports included a going concern qualification. During our fiscal years ended July 31, 2019 and 2018 and the subsequent interim
period preceding their dismissal, there were no disagreements with Jorgensen, whether or not resolved, on any matter of accounting principles
or practices, financial statement disclosure or auditing scope or procedure, which, if not resolved to the satisfaction of Jorgensen,
would have caused them to make reference to the subject matter of the disagreement in connection with their report on our financial statements. 

On
June 10, 2020, the Company engaged Pan-China Singapore PAC PCCPA to replace Jorgensen as its independent registered public
accounting firm to audit the Company s financial statements for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2020. 

ITEM
9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Under
the supervision and with the participation of our principal executive officer, Zhao Lixin, and principal financial officer, Feng Wanning,
we conducted an evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined under Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e)
promulgated under the Exchange Act, as of July 31, 2021. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial
officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were ineffective at such time to ensure that information required to be
disclosed by us in the reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act were recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the
time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Our principal executive officer and principal financial officer also concluded
that our disclosure controls, which are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file
or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, were inappropriate to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure. 

Based
on management s assessment, the Company determined that there were material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting
as of July 31, 2021. The material weaknesses identified were as follows: 

Due to the small size of the Company and the lack of an accounting and finance department or a sufficient
number of experienced accounting and finance personnel, there were limited controls over information processing. 

There was an inadequate segregation of duties consistent with control objectives as management was composed
of only three persons at fiscal year-end, and there remains an issue with inadequate segregation of duties as of the date of filing this
Annual Report. In order to remedy this situation, we would need to hire additional managers and staff to provide greater segregation
of duties. Currently, it is not financially feasible to hire additional managers and staff to obtain optimal segregation of duties. Management
will reassess this matter on an ongoing basis to determine whether improvement in segregation of duties is feasible. 

The Company does not have a formal audit committee with a financial expert, and thus the Company lacks
the Board oversight role within the financial reporting process. 

Although the financial statements and footnotes are reviewed by our management, we do not have formal policies
and procedures necessary to adequately review significant accounting transactions and the accounting treatment of those transactions. 

48 

As
a result of these material weaknesses, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective
as of July 31, 2021. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting,
such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented
or detected on a timely basis. A significant deficiency is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial
reporting that is less severe than a material weakness, yet important enough to merit attention by those responsible for oversight of
the company s financial reporting. 

Evaluation
of Internal Controls and Procedures 

Management
is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. As defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under
the Exchange Act, internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the Company s
principal executive, principal operating and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the
Company s Board of Directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States of America. 

The
Company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the Company s assets;
(2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with
authorizations of the Company s management and directors; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection
of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of
any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,
or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

Our
management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting at July 31, 2021, and determined that, as of July
31, 2021, our internal control over financial reporting was not effective. 

This
Annual Report does not include an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial
reporting. Management s report was not subject to attestation by the Company s registered public accounting firm pursuant
to the exemption provided to issuers that are not large accelerated filers nor accelerated filers under the
Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. 

Changes
in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting 

There
have been no changes to our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during our last fiscal year that have materially
affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.

Term
of Office 

Our
directors hold their position until the next annual meeting of shareholders and until their successors are elected and qualified by our
shareholders, or until their earlier death, retirement, resignation or removal. 

Family
Relationships 

There
are no family relationships between the Company and any of our current or proposed directors or executive officers. 

Corporate
Governance 

Our
board of directors has not established any committees, including an audit committee, a compensation committee or a nominating committee,
or any committee performing a similar function. The functions of those committees are being undertaken by our Board. Because we do not
have any independent directors, our Board believes that the establishment of committees of our Board would not provide any benefits to
the Company and could be considered more form than substance. 

We
do not have a policy regarding the consideration of any director candidates that may be recommended by our shareholders, including the
minimum qualifications for director candidates, nor have our officers and directors established a process for identifying and evaluating
director nominees.

with most small companies, until such time as we further develop our business, achieve a stronger revenue base and have sufficient working
capital to purchase directors and officers insurance, we do not have any immediate prospects to attract independent directors.
When we are able to expand our Board to include one or more independent directors, we intend to establish an audit committee of our Board
of Directors. It is our intention that one or more of these independent directors will also qualify as an audit committee financial expert.
Our securities are not quoted on an exchange that has requirements that a majority of our Board members be independent and we are not
currently otherwise subject to any law, rule or regulation requiring that all or any portion of our Board of Directors include independent 
directors, nor are we required to establish or maintain an audit committee or other committee of our Board. 

Communications

Shareholders
with questions about the Company are encouraged to contact the Company by sending communications to the attention of the Chief Executive
Officer at Room 1703B, Zhongzhou Building, No. 3088, Jintian Road, Futian District, Shenzhen City, Guangdong Province, PRC 518000. Stockholders
may communicate with the Board of Directors by sending their communications to the Board of Directors, c/o the Chief Executive Officer
at the same address. 

Director
Compensation 

Our
current directors are employees of the Company. They have not received and will not receive compensation for their service outside the

If
our Board consists of any non-employee directors in the future, we may compensate our non-employee directors for their service in the
future. We also intend to allow our non-employee directors to participate in any equity compensation plans that we adopt in the future.
