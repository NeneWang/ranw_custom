 Note regarding forward-looking statements 
 This report contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act"). We have based these forward-looking statements largely on our current expectations and projections about future events and financial trends affecting the financial condition of our business. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks, uncertainties and assumptions, including, among other things: 
 
 general economic and business conditions, both nationally and in our markets, 
 our expectations and estimates concerning future financial performance, financing plans and the impact of competition, 
 our ability to implement our growth strategy, 
 anticipated trends in our business, 
 advances in technologies, and 
 other risk factors set forth herein. 
 
 In addition, in this report, we use words such as "anticipates," "believes," "plans," "expects," "future," "intends," and similar expressions to identify forward-looking statements. As used in this current report, the terms "we", "us", "our" and the "company" refer to Hammer Fiber Optics Holdings Corp. 
 We undertake no obligation to update publicly or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise after the date of this Annual Report on Form 10K. In light of these risks and uncertainties, the forward-looking events and circumstances discussed in this prospectus may not occur and actual results could differ materially from those anticipated or implied in the forward-looking statements. 
 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 
 Our Corporate History and Background 
 The Company was incorporated in the State of Nevada on September 23, 2010, under the name Recursos Montana S.A. The Company's principal activity was as a pre-exploration stage company engaged in the acquisition and exploration of mineral properties then owned by the Company. During this time, the Company was deemed a "shell company" in the pre-exploration stage and was ultimately unable to commence exploration activities. 
 On February 2, 2015, the Company entered into a Share Exchange Agreement with Tanaris Power Holdings, Inc., whereby the Company acquired 100 of Tanaris Power Holdings, Inc. issued and outstanding common stock in exchange for shares of the Company's common stock equal 51 of the issued and outstanding common stock and cash consideration to Tanaris in the aggregate amount of 350,000. Tanaris Power Holdings, Inc. was the owner of certain rights in connection with the marketing and sale of smart lithium-ion batteries and battery technologies for various industrial vehicles markets and related applications. On March 6, 2015, the Company amended its Articles of Incorporation to change its name to Tanaris Power Holdings, Inc. 
 On April 25, 2016, Tanaris Power Holdings, Inc., a Nevada corporation entered into a Share Exchange Agreement (the "Share Exchange Agreement") with Hammer Fiber Optics Investments, Ltd., a Delaware corporation ("HFOI"), and the controlling stockholders of HFOI (the "HFOI Shareholders"). Pursuant to the Share Exchange Agreement, the Company acquired 20,000,000 shares of common stock of HFOI from the HFOI shareholders (the "HFOI Shares") and in exchange the Company issued to the HFOI Shareholders 50,000,000 (post-Merger) restricted shares of its common stock (the "HMMR Shares"). As a result of the Share Exchange Agreement, HFOI became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. Hammer Fiber Optics Investments, Ltd. was formed in the State of Delaware on June 13, 2014. 
 On April 13, 2016, our Board of Directors approved a Plan of Merger (the "Plan of Merger") under Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) Section 92A.180 to merge (the "Merger") with our wholly-owned subsidiary Hammer Fiber Optics Holdings Corp., a Nevada corporation, to effect a name change from Tanaris Power Holdings, Inc. to Hammer Fiber Optics Holdings Corp. The transaction was accounted for as a reverse merger. The Plan of Merger also provided for a 1 for 1,000 exchange ratio for shareholders of both the Company and Hammer Fiber Optics Holdings Corp., which had the effect of a 1 for 1,000 reverse split of our common stock. Articles of Merger were filed with the Secretary of State of Nevada on April 13, 2016 and, on April 14, 2016, this corporate action was submitted to FINRA for its review and approval. 
 On May 3, 2016, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority ("FINRA") approved the merger with our wholly-owned subsidiary, Hammer Fiber Optics Holdings Corp. Accordingly, thereafter the Company's name was changed and our shares of common stock began trading on the Over the Counter Bulletin Board (OTCBB) under our new ticker symbol "HMMR" as of May 27, 2016. 
 
 3 

On September 11, 2018, our Board of Directors approved stock purchase agreements with 1stPoint Communications LLC and its subsidiaries, Endstream Communications LLC, Open Data Centers LLC and Shelcomm Inc. for the acquisition of all of the equity of the entities. 1stPoint and its subsidiaries possess CLEC licenses in Florida, New York State, and a nationwide CMRS (Commercial Mobile Radio Services) license. The companies operate a data center facility in Piscataway, New Jersey. The acquisition of 1stPoint Communications, LLC, Open Data Centers, LLC and Shelcomm, Inc. closed on November 1, 2018. The acquisition of Endstream Communications, LLC closed on December 17, 2018. 
 On January 29, 2019 our Board of Directors approved a stock purchase agreement with American Network, Inc to acquire all of its equity. The acquisition of American Network, Inc closed on September 1, 2019. 
 As of April 30, 2020 our Board of Directors approved the discontinuation of the operations of Open Data Centers LLC. The operations of Open Data Centers, LLC were discontinued effective April 30, 2020 and the Company shut down its operations in its Piscataway, NJ data center. 
 On October 19, 2021 our Board of Directors approved a name change from Hammer Fiber Optics Holdings Corp to Hammer Technology Holdings. The name change was submitted to the Secretary of State of Nevada on October 7, 2021 for an effective date of October 19, 2021 and, on October 11, 2021, this corporate action was submitted to FINRA for its review and approval. 
 On October 25, 2021 our Board of Directors approved a share exchange agreement with Telecom Financial Services Limited ("TFS") for the acquisition one hundred percent (100 of its stock. TFS owns the intellectual property critical to the operations of the company's financial technology business unit as well as certain key supplier, marketing and operating agreements. TFS will be renamed HammerPay [USA] Ltd. This acquisition has been discussed in the Subsequent Events.

 ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 
 You should carefully consider each of the risks and uncertainties described below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, as well as any amendments or updates reflected in subsequent filings with the SEC. We believe these risks and uncertainties, individually or in the aggregate, could cause our actual results to differ materially from expected and historical results and could materially and adversely affect our business operations, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. Further, additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our results and business operations. 
 Risks Associated with Our Business 
 Our operations and financial performance could be negatively impacted, if the markets for our products do not develop and expand as we anticipate. 
 The markets for our products and services are characterized by rapidly changing technologies, evolving industry or regulatory standards and new product introductions. Our success is dependent on the successful introduction of new products and services, or upgrades of current products and services, and our ability to compete with new technologies. The following factors related to our products, services and markets, if they do not continue as in the recent past, could have an adverse impact on our operations: 
 
 our ability to source critical materials such as optical fiber and cable and hardware and equipment, at competitive prices; 

4 

our ability to develop new products in response to government regulations and laws; 

our ability to secure and retain adequate spectrum to facilitate ongoing operations and deployment of our services beyond our present geographic footprint. 
 
 We rely on contract manufacturing of our products. Our inability to secure production sources meeting our quality, cost, working conditions and other requirements, or failures by our contractors to perform, could harm our sales and reputation. 
 We source many of our materials from international manufacturers. As a result, we must locate and secure production that meets our demands. We depend on our manufacturers to maintain adequate financial resources and maintain sufficient development and manufacturing capacity. We do not have material long-term contracts with any of our manufacturers, and these manufacturers generally may unilaterally terminate their relationship with us at any time. Our dependence on contract manufacturers could subject us to a number of risks if these manufacturers do not meet our quality, cost, working conditions and other requirements or if they fail to materially perform, any of which could seriously harm our sales and reputation. Further, if we need to place greater demands on our current manufacturers due to increased customer demands, or seek additional or replacement manufacturers, we may be unable to do so on terms that are acceptable to us, if at all. 
 Violation of labor laws and practices by our manufacturers and suppliers could harm our business. 
 We require our manufacturers and suppliers to operate in compliance with applicable laws and regulations. While the Company promotes ethical business practices, we do not control our manufacturers or suppliers or their labor practices. The violation of labor or other laws by any of our manufacturers or suppliers, or divergence of their labor practices from those generally accepted as ethical in the local markets, could interrupt or otherwise disrupt the shipment of our products, harm the value of our trademarks, damage our reputation or expose us to potential liability for their wrongdoings. 
 A privacy breach could damage our reputation and our relationship with our customers, expose the Company to litigation risk and adversely affect our business. 
 As part of our normal course of business, we collect, process and retain sensitive and confidential customer information. Despite security measures we have in place, our facilities and systems may be vulnerable to security breaches, acts of vandalism, computer viruses, misplaced or lost data, programming and/or human errors, or other similar events. Any security breach involving the misappropriation, loss or other unauthorized disclosure of confidential information could severely damage our reputation and our relationships with our customers, expose the Company to risks of litigation and liability and adversely affect our business. 
 Our Articles of Incorporation exculpates our officers and directors from certain liability to our Company or our stockholders. 
 Our Articles of Incorporation contain a provision limiting the liability of our officers and directors for their acts or failures to act, except for acts involving intentional misconduct, fraud or a knowing violation of law. This limitation on liability may reduce the likelihood of derivative litigation against our officers and directors and may discourage or deter our stockholders from suing our officers and directors based upon breaches of their duties to our Company. 
 Our directors and named executive officers are also our principal stockholders, as such they will be able to exert significant influence over matters submitted to stockholders for approval, which could delay or prevent a change in corporate control or result in the entrenchment of management or the Board of Directors, possibly conflicting with the interests of other stockholders. 
 Our directors and named executive officers are also our principal stockholders as such they exert significant influence in determining the outcome of corporate actions requiring stockholder approval and otherwise control of our business. This control could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control or entrenching management or the Board of Directors, which could conflict with the interests of our other stockholders and, consequently, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. 
 The Company's independent auditors have issued a going concern opinion. 
 The Company's ability to remain a going concern is highly dependent on its ability to raise sufficient debt and/or equity capital, among other things. No assurance can be given that the company will be successful in these efforts. 
 Information technology dependency and security vulnerabilities could lead to reduced revenue, liability claims, or competitive harm. 
 The Company is increasingly dependent on sophisticated information technology and infrastructure. Any significant breakdown, intrusion, interruption or corruption of these systems or data breaches could have a material adverse effect on our business. 
 We use electronic information technology (IT) in our manufacturing processes and operations and other aspects of our business. Despite our implementation of security measures, our IT systems are vulnerable to disruptions from computer viruses, natural disasters, unauthorized access, cyber-attack and other similar disruptions. A material breach in the security of our IT systems could include the theft of our intellectual property or trade secrets. Such disruptions or security breaches could result in the theft, unauthorized use or publication of our intellectual property and/or confidential business information, harm our competitive position, reduce the value of our investment in research and development and other strategic initiatives, or otherwise adversely affect our business. We have, from time to time, experienced incidents related to our IT systems, and expect that such incidents will continue, including malware and computer virus attacks, unauthorized access, systems failures and disruptions. We have measures and defenses in place against unauthorized access, but we may not be able to prevent, immediately detect, or remediate such events. 
 
 5 

Business disruptions could affect our operating results 
 A significant portion of our development activities and certain other critical business operations are concentrated in a few geographic areas. A major earthquake, fire or other catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our critical facilities could severely affect our ability to conduct normal business operations and, as a result, our future financial results could be materially and adversely affected. 
 If we cannot attract more customers to purchase our products, we may not be able to increase or sustain our revenues. 
 Our future success will depend on our ability to attract additional customers. The growth of our customer base could be adversely affected by: 
 
 customer unwillingness to implement our products and services; 

any delays or difficulties that we may incur in completing the development and introduction of our products or product enhancements or service enhancements; 

the overall satisfaction of our customers; 

new product and service introductions by our competitors; 

any failure of our products to perform as expected; or 

any difficulty we may incur in meeting customers' expectations. 
 
 Fluctuations in the economy affect the telecommunications industry, including broadband and Internet and may decrease demand for various products and services. Such a decrease may have an adverse effect on the demand in the fiber optic sector and negatively impact the growth of our customer base. 
 Foreign Currency 
 We transact business in various foreign currencies including the Euro and the Leone. In general, the functional currency of a foreign operation is the local country's currency. Consequently, revenues and expenses of operations outside the United States are translated into UDS Dollars using the weighted-average exchange rates on the period end date and assets and liabilities of operations outside the United States are translated into US Dollars using the change rate on the balance sheet dates. The effects of foreign currency translation adjustments are included in the stockholders' equity as a component of the AOCL in the accompanying financial statements. 
 Risks Relating to Ownership of Our Securities 
 Our stock price may be volatile, which may result in losses to our shareholders. 
 The stock markets have experienced significant price and trading volume fluctuations, and the market prices of companies listed on the OTCQB quotation system in which shares of our common stock are listed, have been volatile in the past and have experienced sharp share price and trading volume changes. The trading price of our common stock is likely to be volatile and could fluctuate widely in response to many factors, including the following, some of which are beyond our control: 
 
 variations in our operating results; 

changes in expectations of our future financial performance, including financial estimates by securities analysts and investors; 

changes in operating and stock price performance of other companies in our industry; 

6 

additions or departures of key personnel; and 

future sales of our common stock. 
 
 Domestic and international stock markets often experience significant price and volume fluctuations. These fluctuations, as well as general economic and political conditions unrelated to our performance, may adversely affect the price of our common stock. 
 Our common shares may become thinly traded and you may be unable to sell at or near ask prices, or at all. 
 We cannot predict the extent to which an active public market for trading our common stock will be sustained. The trading price of our common shares has historically been sporadically or "thinly-traded" meaning that the number of persons interested in purchasing our common shares at or near ask prices at any given time may be relatively small or non-existent. This situation is attributable to a number of factors, including the fact that we are a small company which is relatively unknown to stock analysts, stock brokers, institutional investors and others in the investment community who generate or influence sales volume. Even if we came to the attention of such persons, those persons tend to be risk-averse and may be reluctant to follow, purchase, or recommend the purchase of shares of an unproven company such as ours until such time as we become more seasoned and viable. As a consequence, there may be periods of several days or more when trading activity in our shares is minimal or non-existent, as compared to a seasoned issuer which has a large and steady volume of trading activity that will generally support continuous sales without an adverse effect on share price. We cannot provide any assurance that a broader or more active public trading market for our common stock will develop or be sustained, or that current trading levels will be sustained. 
 The market price for our common stock is particularly volatile given our status as a relatively small company, which could lead to wide fluctuations in our share price. You may be unable to sell your common stock at or above your purchase price if at all, which may result in substantial losses to you. 
 Shareholders should be aware that, according to SEC Release No. 34-29093, the market for penny stocks can be negatively affected from patterns of fraud and abuse. Such patterns include (1) control of the market for the security by one or a few broker-dealers that are often related to the promoter or issuer; (2) manipulation of prices through prearranged matching of purchases and sales and false and misleading press releases; (3) boiler room practices involving high-pressure sales tactics and unrealistic price projections by inexperienced sales persons; (4) excessive and undisclosed bid-ask differential and markups by selling broker-dealers; and (5) the wholesale dumping of the same securities by promoters and broker-dealers after prices have been manipulated to a desired level, along with the resulting inevitable collapse of those prices and with consequent investor losses. Our management is aware of the abuses that have occurred historically in the penny stock market. Although we do not expect to be in a position to dictate the behavior of the market or of broker-dealers who participate in the market, management will strive within the confines of practical limitations to prevent the described patterns from being established with respect to our securities. The occurrence of these patterns or practices could increase the volatility of our share price. 
 We do not anticipate paying any cash dividends to our common shareholders. 
 We presently do not anticipate that we will pay dividends on any of our common stock in the foreseeable future. If payment of dividends does occur at some point in the future, it would be contingent upon our revenues and earnings, if any, capital requirements, and general financial condition. The payment of any common stock dividends will be within the discretion of our Board of Directors. We presently intend to retain any earnings after paying the interest for the preferred stock, if any, to implement our business plan; accordingly, we do not anticipate the declaration of any dividends for common stock in the foreseeable future. 
 Volatility in our common share price may subject us to securities litigation. 
 The market for our common stock is characterized by significant price volatility as compared to seasoned issuers, and we expect that our share price will continue to be more volatile than a seasoned issuer for the indefinite future. In the past, plaintiffs have often initiated securities class action litigation against a company following periods of volatility in the market price of its securities. We may, in the future, be the target of similar litigation. Securities litigation could result in substantial costs and liabilities and could divert management's attention and resources. 
 
 7 
 
 The elimination of monetary liability against our directors, officers and employees under Nevada law and the existence of indemnification rights of our directors, officers and employees may result in substantial expenditures by our company and may discourage lawsuits against our directors, officers and employees. 
 Our Articles of Incorporation contain a specific provision that eliminates the liability of our directors and officers for monetary damages to our company and shareholders. Further, we are prepared to give such indemnification to our directors and officers to the extent provided for by Nevada law. We may also have contractual indemnification obligations under our employment agreements with our officers. The foregoing indemnification obligations could result in our company incurring substantial expenditures to cover the cost of settlement or damage awards against directors and officers, which we may be unable to recoup. These provisions and resultant costs may also discourage our company from bringing a lawsuit against directors and officers for breaches of their fiduciary duties, and may similarly discourage the filing of derivative litigation by our shareholders against our directors and officers even though such actions, if successful, might otherwise benefit our company and shareholders. 
 
 8 

Our business is subject to changing regulations related to corporate governance and public disclosure that have increased both our costs and the risk of noncompliance. 
 Because our common stock is publicly traded, we are subject to certain rules and regulations of federal, state and financial market exchange entities charged with the protection of investors and the oversight of companies whose securities are publicly traded. These entities, including the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, the United States Security Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), have issued requirements and regulations and continue to develop additional regulations and requirements in response to corporate scandals and laws enacted by Congress, most notably the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Our efforts to comply with these regulations have resulted in, and are likely to continue resulting in, increased general and administrative expenses and diversion of management time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. Because new and modified laws, regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations in many cases due to their lack of specificity, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. This evolution may result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and additional costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to our disclosure and governance practices. 
 ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS 
 None 
 ITEM 2. PROPERTIES 
 The Company does not own any real property, nor have any long term lease obligations. 
 ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
 From time to time, the Company may become subject to various legal proceedings that are incidental to the ordinary conduct of its business. Although the Company cannot accurately predict the amount of any liability that may ultimately arise with respect to any of these matters, it makes provision for potential liabilities when it deems them probable and reasonably estimable. These provisions are based on current information and legal advice and may be adjusted from time to time according to developments.

 Overview 
 The company was incorporated on September 23, 2010 pursuant to the laws of the State of Nevada under the name of Recursos Montana S.A. On March 6, 2015 the Company amended its Articles of Incorporation to change its name to "Tanaris Power Holding, Inc." On April 25, 2016, Tanaris Power Holdings, Inc., a Nevada corporation (the "Company" or "TPHX") entered into a Share Exchange Agreement (the "Share Exchange Agreement") with Hammer Fiber Optics Investments, Ltd., a Delaware corporation ("HFOI"), and the controlling stockholders of HFOI (the "HFOI Shareholders"). Pursuant to the Share Exchange Agreement, closed on July 19, 2016, the Company acquired 20,000,000 shares of common stock of HFOI from the HFOI shareholders and in exchange the Company issued to the HFOI Shareholders 50,000,000 (post-Merger) restricted shares of its common stock. As a result of the Share Exchange Agreement, HFOI became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. 
 The Company was originally organized for the purpose of acquiring and developing mineral properties. The Company had not established the existence of a commercially viable minable ore deposit and therefore did not reach the exploration stage. As such, the company negotiated to dispose of the business of investing in minerals in favor of developing new business opportunities in the technology sector. The company Hammer Fiber Optics Holdings Corp. is now an alternative telecommunications carrier that is poised to position itself as a premier provider of diversified dark fiber networking solutions as well as high capacity broadband wireless access networks in the United States and abroad. 
 On September 11, 2018, Mark Stogdill, President and Chief Executive Officer and Executive Director of the Board of Directors of the Company resigned from his position as President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company. Mr. Stogdill retains his position as a Director of the Board of Directors. In combination with this change, Erik B. Levitt was appointed the interim President and Chief Executive Officer, effective immediately. 
 On October 10, 2018 the Company announced the closure of the Atlantic City, NJ wireless broadband network as a result of the termination of the Master Spectrum Lease Agreement held by the Company subsidiary Hammer Fiber Optic Investments Ltd. d/b/a Hammer Communications by Verizon Communications. Verizon Communications had informed the Company of their intention to honor the terms of the lease agreement, then subsequently issued a notification to the Company that the spectrum lease for the 28 GHz spectrum will be prematurely terminated as of October 31, 2018. The Company negotiated with Verizon to find a path forward and was offered a less desirable spectrum leasing arrangement. After extensive engineering discussions it was determined that it was not feasible to pursue the alternative agreement proposed by Verizon. As a result, the Company discontinued operations as of October 31, 2018.

On September 11, 2018, our Board of Directors approved stock purchase agreements with 1stPoint Communications LLC and its subsidiaries, Endstream Communications LLC, Open Data Centers LLC and Shelcomm Inc. for the acquisition of all of the equity of the entities. 1stPoint and its subsidiaries possess CLEC licenses in Florida, New York State, and a nationwide CMRS (Commercial Mobile Radio Services) license. The companies operate a data center facility in Piscataway, New Jersey. The acquisition of 1stPoint Communications, LLC, Open Data Centers, LLC and Shelcomm, Inc. closed on November 1, 2018. Mr. Levitt was also elected as a member of the Board of Directors, effective immediately. The acquisition of Endstream Communications, LLC closed on December 17, 2018. 
 On January 29, 2019 our Board of Directors approved a stock purchase agreement with American Network, Inc to acquire all of its equity. The acquisition of American Network, Inc closed on September 1, 2019. 
 As of April 30, 2020 our Board of Directors approved the discontinuation of the operations of Open Data Centers LLC. The operations of Open Data Centers, LLC were discontinued effective April 30, 2020 and the Company shut down its operations in its Piscataway, NJ data center. 
 On September 14, 2021, Erik B. Levitt, President and Chief Executive Officer and Executive Director of the Board of Directors of the Company resigned from his position as President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company. Mr. Levitt retains his position as an Executive Director of the Board of Directors and Principal Financial Officer as well as the Managing Member and Chief Executive Officer of 1stPoint Communications, LLC and Endstream Communications, LLC. In combination with this change, Michael C. Cothill was appointed the Executive Chairman, effective immediately. 
 On October 19, 2021 our Board of Directors approved a name change from Hammer Fiber Optics Holdings Corp to Hammer Technology Holdings. The name change was submitted to the Secretary of State of Nevada on October 7, 2021 for an effective date of October 19, 2021 and, on October 11, 2021, this corporate action was submitted to FINRA for its review and approval. 
 On October 25, 2021 our Board of Directors approved a share exchange agreement with Telecom Financial Services Limited ("TFS") for the acquisition one hundred percent (100 of its stock. TFS owns the intellectual property critical to the operations of the company's financial technology business unit as well as certain key supplier, marketing and operating agreements. TFS will be renamed HammerPay. This acquisition has been discussed in the Subsequent Events. 
 COVID-19 Pandemic Update 
 In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared a global health pandemic related to the outbreak of a novel coronavirus. The COVID-19 pandemic adversely affected the company's financial performance in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal year 2020 and could have an impact throughout fiscal year 2021. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, government health officials have recommended and mandated precautions to mitigate the spread of the virus, including shelter-in-place orders, prohibitions on public gatherings and other similar measures. As a result, the company and certain of the company's customers and suppliers temporarily closed locations beginning late in the second quarter of fiscal year 2020, continuing into the third quarter of fiscal year 2020. Partly due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company shut down the operations of its' Open Data Centers, LLC operations effective April 30, 2020. There is uncertainty around the duration and breadth of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the impact it will have on the company's operations, supply chain and demand for its products. As a result, the ultimate impact on the company's business, financial condition or operating results cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. 
 As of the date of this document, one hundred percent of the loans provided under the Paycheck Protection Program have been forgiven by the Small Business Administration. These notes have been retired and are categorized as Other Income on our financial statements. 
 Results of Operations 
 The Year Ended July 31, 2021 Compared to the Year Ended July 31, 2020 
 Net revenues from continuing operations for the year ended July 31, 2021 and 2020 were 2,199,127 and 1,781,139, respectively. 
 During the year ended July 31, 2021, the Company incurred total operating expenses from continuing operations of 1,568,357 compared with 2,058,804 for the comparable period ended in 2020. The increase in operating costs was primarily due to expenses related to its increased revenues in its Over-the-Top ("OTT") business as well as development expenses associated with new product development. 
 The Company recorded depreciation expense of 55,398 during the year ended July 31, 2021 compared to 44,454 in the comparable period in 2020, primarily due to increases in computer equipment in support of growth in the OTT business. 
 During the year ended July 31, 2021, interest expense was 30,797 compared to 31,843 in the comparable period in 2020.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 We have financed our operations since inception primarily through private placements of our common stock. As of July 31, 2021, we had cash and cash equivalents of 73,971. 
 Net cash from operating activities was -78,360 and 150,703 for the year ended July 31, 2021 and July 31, 2020, respectively. The decrease was primarily due to the development activities related to Hammer's telecommunications software and operations of its new wireless network in Huntsville, AL. 
 Net cash used in investing activities was 75,503 and 50,857 for the year ended July 31, 2021 and July 31, 2020, respectively. The increase in cash used in investing activities was primarily due software development activities and its new network in Huntsville, AL. 
 Net cash provided by financing activities was 157,538 and 299,527 for the year ended July 31, 2021 and July 31, 2020, respectively. The decrease in cash provided by financing activities for the period ended July 31, 2021 when compared to the same period in 2020 was primarily the result of reduced operating cash flow requirements associated with the continuing operations of the business and payments for settlements against discontinued operations. 
 We have not attained profitable operations and are dependent upon obtaining financing to pursue any extensive activities. For these reasons, our auditors have included in their report on our audited financial statements for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2021 an explanatory paragraph regarding factors that raise substantial doubt that we will be able to continue as a going concern. 
 Going Concern 
 As at July 31, 2021, substantial doubt existed as to the Company's ability to continue as a going concern as the Company has earned only minimal revenue, has no certainty of earning additional revenues in the future, has a working capital deficit and an overall accumulated deficit since inception. The Company will require additional financing to continue operations either from management, existing shareholders, or new shareholders through equity financing and/or sources of debt financing. These factors raise substantial doubt regarding the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
 To the Shareholders and 
 Board of Directors of Hammer Fiber Optics Holdings Corp. 
 Opinion on the Financial Statements 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Hammer Fiber Optics Holdings Corp. (the "Company") as of July 31, 2021 and 2020, the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders' equity (deficit), and cash flows for each of the two-years in the period ended July 31, 2021, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the "financial statements"). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of July 31, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended July 31, 2021, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
 Substantial Doubt About the Company's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern 
 The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company's cumulative net losses raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern for one year from the issuance of these financial statements. Management's plans are also described in Note 4. The consolidated financial statements do not include adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 
 Basis of Opinion 
 These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) ("PCAOB") and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 We conducted our audit in accordance with standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audit, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 
 Our audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 Critical Audit Matters 
 The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.

Intangible Assets with Indefinite Lives 
 As described in Notes 3 and 4 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company had intangible assets with indefinite useful lives. The assessment for impairment on these intangible assets required accounting considerations and significant estimates. 
 A significant portion of the Company's intangible assets are wireless licenses that provide wireless operations with the exclusive right to utilize designated radio frequency spectrum to provide communication services. The Company tests the wireless licenses and other indefinite lived intangible assets for potential impairment annually or more frequently if impairment indicators are present. The Company performs a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative impairment test. Based upon the qualitative and quantitative factors, the Company determined that its' intangible assets were not impaired at July 31, 2021. 
 We identified the accounting considerations of the valuation of intangible assets with indefinite lives as a critical audit matter. The principal considerations for our determination were: (1) the significant judgment by management in determining the accounting for the valuation of intangible assets with indefinite useful lives and the (2) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating management's accounting for the valuation of intangible assets with indefinite useful lives. 
 Our audit procedures related to management's conclusion on the evaluation of the valuation of intangible assets with indefinite lives, included the following, among others: (1) evaluating the assessment performed by Management and, (2) independently assessing the carrying values of the intangible assets with indefinite lives

 NOTE 3 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
 Basis of presentation 
 The accompanying consolidated financial statements and related notes have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("U.S. GAAP"). 
 Use of estimates 
 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
 COVID-19 Pandemic Update 
 In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared a global health pandemic related to the outbreak of a novel coronavirus. The COVID-19 pandemic adversely affected the company's financial performance in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal year 2020 and could have an impact throughout fiscal year 2021. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, government health officials have recommended and mandated precautions to mitigate the spread of the virus, including shelter-in-place orders, prohibitions on public gatherings and other similar measures. As a result, the company and certain of the company's customers and suppliers temporarily closed locations beginning late in the second quarter of fiscal year 2020, continuing into the third quarter of fiscal year 2020. Partly due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company shut down the operations of its' Open Data Centers, LLC operations effective April 30, 2020. There is uncertainty around the duration and breadth of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the impact it will have on the company's operations, supply chain and demand for its products. As a result, the ultimate impact on the company's business, financial condition or operating results cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. On May 5, 2020 and on February 26, 2021 the Company's 1stPoint Communications LLC subsidiary entered into two 88,097 notes payable to Bank of America, pursuant to the Paycheck Protection Program ("PPP Loan") under the CARES Act. 1stPoint has met the requirements for Loan Forgiveness, and as of October 19, 2021, these notes have been forgiven by the Small Business Administration in accordance with rules of the CARES Act. The amounts of have been reflected as other income in the company's financial statements. 
 Cash and cash equivalents 
 Cash and cash equivalents include cash in banks, money market funds, and certificates of term deposits with maturities of less than three months from inception, which are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which, in the opinion of management, are subject to an insignificant risk of loss in value. 
 Property and equipment 
 Property and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is provided for on a straight-line basis over the useful lives of the assets. For network service equipment, and furniture and fixtures, the useful life is ten and five years, respectively. Leasehold Improvements are depreciated over six years. Expenditures for additions and improvements are capitalized; repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred. 
 Impairment of long-lived assets 
 The Company evaluates long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the assets to future undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the asset. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. The Company has not recognized impairment losses for any long-lived assets.

 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 JULY 31, 2021 and 2020 
 NOTE 3 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED) 
 Notes Receivable 
 These assets are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. Subsequent to initial recognition, they are recorded at amortized cost less any provision for impairment. Individually significant receivables are considered for impairment when they are past due or when other objective evidence is received that a specific counterparty is more likely than not to default. 
 Indefinite lived intangible assets 
 The Company reviews property, plant and equipment, inventory component prepayments and certain identifiable intangibles, excluding goodwill, for impairment. Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of these assets is measured by comparison of their carrying amounts to future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate. If property, plant and equipment, inventory component prepayments and certain identifiable intangibles are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized equals the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds its fair value. The Company has not recorded any related impairment losses. The Company does not amortize goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives, rather such assets are required to be tested for impairment at least annually or sooner whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets may be impaired. The Company has not recorded any related impairment losses. 
 Revenue recognition 
 The Company accounts for revenues under Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2014-09, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers" (Topic 606), which we adopted on August 1, 2018, using the modified retrospective approach. This standard update, along with related subsequently issued updates, clarifies the principles for recognizing revenue and develops a common revenue standard for GAAP. . The Company performs the following five steps: (i) identify the contract(s) with a customer, (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract, (iii) determine the transaction price, (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract, and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. The Company applies the five-step model to arrangements that meet the definition of a contract under Topic 606, including when it is probable that the entity will collect the consideration it is entitled to in exchange for the goods or services it transfers to the customer. At contract inception, once the contract is determined to be within the scope of Topic 606, the Company evaluates the goods or services promised within each contract related performance obligation and assesses whether each promised good or service is distinct. The Company recognizes as revenue, the amount of the transaction price that is allocated to the respective performance obligation when (or as) the performance obligation is satisfied. Amounts invoiced or collected in advance of product delivery or providing services are recorded as unearned revenue or customer deposits. The company accrues for sales returns, bad debts, and other allowances based on its historical experience. The Company's revenues have consisted primarily of subscription agreements for its broadband internet and voice-over-IP phone services. Residential broadband service delivered to customers over the Company's hybrid fiber and wireless network in Atlantic County, New Jersey has been the primary revenue source. Revenues are supplemented by phone and add-on services. Broadband services delivered via fiber optics to enterprise businesses account for the remaining sources of revenue. Services have been billed monthly to subscribers on either a one- year or two-year contract for residential customers and three-year contracts for enterprise business customers. Revenue begins accruing as service is delivered at commencement of the customer's service contract. 
 Income taxes 
 The Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method in accordance with ASC 740, "Accounting for Income Taxes". The asset and liability method provides that deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and for operating loss and tax credit carry forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized.

 NOTE 3 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED) 
 Fair value measurements 
 The Company adopted the provisions of ASC Topic 820, "Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures", which defines fair value as used in numerous accounting pronouncements, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure of fair value measurements. The estimated fair value of certain financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents are carried at historical cost basis, which approximates their fair values because of the short-term nature of these instruments. 
 ASC 820 defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. ASC 820 also establishes a fair value hierarchy, which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. ASC 820 describes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value: 
 Level 1 - quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
 Level 2 - quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or inputs that are observable 
 Level 3 - inputs that are unobservable (for example cash flow modeling inputs based on assumptions) The Company has no assets or liabilities valued at fair value on a recurring basis. 
 Consolidation of financial statements 
 Hammer Fiber Optics Holdings Corp. is the parent company and sole shareholder of Hammer Wireless Corporation, Hammer Fiber Optic Investments Ltd, 1stPoint Communications, LLC, Endstream Communications, LLC, Shelcomm, Inc., Open Data Centers, LLC, and American Network, Inc. The company is also the beneficial owner of Hammer Wireless SL. The financial statements for Hammer Fiber Optics Holdings Corp. and its subsidiaries are reported on a consolidated basis. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. Hammer Fiber Optics Investments, Ltd and Open Data Centers, LLC have been discontinued and are reported on a summarized basis in consolidation. 
 Basic and Diluted Earnings (Loss) per Common Share 
 The basic earnings (loss) per share are calculated by dividing the Company's net income available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares during the year. The diluted earnings (loss) per share is calculated by dividing the Company's net income (loss) available to common shareholders by the diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year. The diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding is the basic weighted number of shares adjusted for any potentially dilutive debt or equity. Diluted earnings (loss) per share are the same as basic earnings (loss) per share due to the lack of dilutive items in the Company. As of July 31, 2021 and 2020, there were no common stock equivalents outstanding. 
 Recent accounting pronouncements 
 In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. ASU 2014-09 is a comprehensive revenue recognition standard that will supersede nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under current U.S. GAAP and replace it with a principle-based approach for determining revenue recognition. ASU 2014-09 will require that companies recognize revenue based on the value of transferred goods or services as they occur in the contract. The ASU also will require additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts, including significant judgments and changes in judgments and assets recognized from costs incurred to obtain or fulfill a contract. In addition, during 2016 the FASB has issued ASU 2016-08, ASU 2016-10 and ASU 2016-12, all of which clarify certain implementation guidance within ASU 2014-09, and ASU 2016-11, which rescinds certain SEC guidance effective upon an entity's adoption of ASU 2014-09. ASU 2014-09 is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted only in annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods therein. The Company adopted ASU No. 2014-09 and related updates on August 1, 2018. Adoption did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.

 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

 NOTE 3 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED) 
 In February 2016, FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). ASU 2016-02 provides for improvements for accounting guidance related to leasing treatments on financial statements as a response to user input. The update maintains two classifications of leases, Financial lease and Operating leases. The Update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018. The Company is assessing the impact this standard will have on its' consolidated financial statements. The Company does not expect the adoption of any other recent accounting pronouncements to have a material impact on its financial statements. 
 Reclassifications 
 Certain reclassifications have been made to the financial statements to conform to the consolidated 2021 financial statement presentation. 
 Accounts Receivable 
 Accounts receivable are recorded at invoiced amount and generally do not bear interest. An allowance for doubtful accounts is established, as necessary, based on past experience and other factors which, in management's judgment, deserve current recognition in estimating bad debts. Such factors include growth and composition of accounts receivable, the relationship of the allowance for doubtful accounts to accounts receivable and current economic conditions. The determination of the collectability of amounts due from customer accounts requires the Company to make judgments regarding future events and trends. Allowances for doubtful accounts are determined based on assessing the Company's portfolio on an individual customer and on an overall basis. This process consists of a review of historical collection experience, current aging status of the customer accounts, and the financial condition of the Company's customers. 
 NOTE 4 - GOING CONCERN 
 The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has consistently sustained losses since its inception. These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern for a period of one year from the issuance of these financial statements. The Company's continuation as a going concern is dependent upon, among other things, its ability to increase revenues, adequately control operating expenses and receive debt and/or equity capital from third parties. No assurance can be given that the Company will be successful in these efforts. 
 The financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. The Company intends to continue to address this condition by seeking to raise additional capital through the issuance of debt and/or the sale of equity until such time that ongoing revenues can sustain the business, at which time capitalization may be considered through other means.

 NOTE 8 - INDEFINITE LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS 
 The Company has intangible assets with indefinite useful lives resulting from various acquisitions, including of 1stPoint Communications LLC and Endstream Communications, LLC. 
 A portion of our intangible assets are wireless licenses that provide our wireless operations with the exclusive right to utilize designated radio frequency spectrum to provide communication services. While licenses are often issued for only a fixed time, such licenses are subject to renewal. License renewals have occurred routinely and at nominal cost. Moreover, the Company has determined that there are currently no legal, regulatory, contractual, competitive, economic or other factors that limit the useful life of our licenses. As a result, we treat the wireless licenses as an indefinite-lived intangible asset. We re-evaluate the useful life determination for wireless licenses each year to determine whether events and circumstances continue to support an indefinite useful life. 
 The Company has 18,934 of recognized indefinite lived intangible assets, which consist of the ownership of Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) address blocks. The Hammer Wireless SL, Ltd. Subsidiary has been granted a nationwide telecommunications and wireless license in the country of Sierra Leone, for which it paid 218,584. Hammer paid 42,500 to Wikibuli, Inc. in exchange for capital stock in Wikibuli, the operating company in Dominica. 
 These assets are not amortized and are evaluated routinely for potential impairment. If a determination is made that the intangible asset is impaired after performing the initial qualitative assessment, the asset's fair value will be calculated and compared with the carrying value to determine whether an impairment loss should be recognized. Based upon the qualitative and quantitative factors, the Company determined that its intangible assets are not impaired at July 31, 2021. 
 NOTE 9 - RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS 
 On October 9, 2016, the Company entered into a short-term loan agreement with a family member of a member of the Company's Board of Directors (BOD). Under the agreement, the lender advanced 100,000 to the Company for the purpose of providing working capital. The loan carries an annual interest rate of 3 . On September 15, 2016, the Company received 210,000 from a family member of a member of the BOD, also for the purpose of working capital, and has recorded such amount as a deposit in anticipation of executing a loan agreement. The company settled this note for the full amount in stock at 3/share of HMMR common stock on July 31, 2021. 
 On April, 9 2018, the Company received an additional 20,000 deposit from a family member of a member of the BOD. The amount was intended as additional working capital. The Company anticipates execution of a loan agreement relative to this advance. 
 During the fiscal year ended July 31, 2016, the Company entered into two promissory notes with a Director for an aggregate amount of 2,400,000 and 1,000,000, respectively. The 2,400,000 note matures on January 4, 2019. The terms consist of ten principal and interest payments due quarterly in the amount of 300,000 for total payments of 3,000,000. To date, the Company has made payments on this note amounting to 725,831. The payments were applied to interest accrued as of the time of payment as well as to principal.

The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the Act) reduced the statutory corporate federal income tax rate from 35 to 21 beginning in 2018. The blended tax rate for 2018 considered the tax laws enacted in 2017. The tax effect of temporary differences from net operating losses ("NOL") has been reduced to reflect the newly enacted rates. 
 The Company has approximately 22,912,000 of NOL carried forward to offset taxable income in future years. The tax laws enacted in 2017 also changed the treatment of NOL. Prior to the change, NOL could be carried back up to two years and carried forward up to 20 years to offset taxable income. In the new tax law, the NOL that can be carried forward is limited to 80 of the taxable income, can no longer be carried back, but are allowed to be carried forward indefinitely. The new law will apply to NOL arising in tax years beginning

 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 JULY 31, 2021 and 2020 
 NOTE 11 - INCOME TAXES (CONTINUED) 
 December 31, 2017, hence, 3,000,000 of the NOL will be subject to the 80 limitation and will be carried forward indefinitely while 19,297,000 of the NOL will be carried forward for 20 years and will begin to expire in 2036. 
 In assessing the realization of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the period in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. Based on the assessment, management has established a full valuation allowance against all of the deferred tax assets relating to NOLs for every period because it is more likely than not that all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. 
 As of July 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company has no unrecognized income tax benefits. The Company's policy for classifying interest and penalties associated with unrecognized income tax benefits is to include such items as a tax expense. No interest or penalties have been recorded during the years ended July 31, 2021 and 2020. As of July 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company did not have any amounts recorded pertaining to uncertain tax positions. 
 The tax years from 2015 and forward remain open to examination by federal and state authorities due to net operating loss and credit carryforwards. The Company is currently not under examination by the Internal Revenue Service or any other taxing authorities.

 NOTE 14 - FOREIGN CURRENCY 
 We transact business in various foreign currencies including the Euro and the Leone. In general, the functional currency of a foreign operation is the local country's currency. Consequently, revenues and expenses of operations outside the United States are translated into US Dollars using the weighted-average exchange rates on the period end date and assets and liabilities of operations outside the United States are translated into US Dollars using the change rate on the balance sheet dates. The effects of foreign currency translation adjustments are not material to the Company's accompanying financial statements.

 ITEM 9A(T). CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Management's Report on Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 , as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer (who is acting as our principal executive officer, principal financial officer and principle accounting officer) to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 As of July 31, 2020, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision of our Chief Executive Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. The officer concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of the end of the period covered by this report. 
 Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are required to assess the expected benefits and related costs of control procedures. The objectives of internal control include providing management with reasonable, but not absolute, assurance that assets are safeguarded against loss from unauthorized use or disposition, and that transactions are executed in accordance with management's authorization and recorded properly to permit the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of July 31, 2021. In making this assessment, our management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ("COSO") in Internal Control-Integrated Framework. Our management has concluded that, as of July 31, 2021, our internal control over financial reporting was not effective. 
 
 15 

This annual report does not include an attestation report of our company's registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management's report was not subject to attestation by our Company's registered public accounting firm pursuant to temporary rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission that permit our company to provide only management's report in this annual report. 
 Inherent limitations on effectiveness of controls 
 Internal control over financial reporting has inherent limitations which include but is not limited to the use of independent professionals for advice and guidance, interpretation of existing and/or changing rules and principles, segregation of management duties, scale of organization, and personnel factors. Internal control over financial reporting is a process which involves human diligence and compliance and is subject to lapses in judgment and breakdowns resulting from human failures. Internal control over financial reporting also can be circumvented by collusion or improper management override. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis, however these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process and it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce, though not eliminate, this risk. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There have been no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the year ended July 31, 2021 that have materially or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.

 ITEM 12. CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS, AND DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE 
 Related Party Transactions 
 None of the directors or executive officers of the Company, nor any person who owned of record or was known to own beneficially more than 10 of the Company's outstanding shares of its common stock, nor any associate or affiliate of such persons or companies, has any material interest, direct or indirect, in any transaction that has occurred during the past two fiscal years, or in any proposed transaction, which has materially affected or will affect the Company other than as disclosed at Note 8 to the financial statements. 
 With regard to any future related party transaction, we plan to fully disclose any and all related party transactions in the following manner: 
 
 Disclosing such transactions in reports where required; 
 Disclosing in any and all filings with the SEC, where required; 
 Obtaining disinterested directors consent; and 
 Obtaining shareholder consent where required. 
 
 Director Independence 
 For purposes of determining director independence, we have applied the definitions set out in NASDAQ Rule 5605(a)(2). The OTCBB on which shares of the Company's Common Stock are quoted does not have any director independence requirements. The NASDAQ definition of "Independent Director" means a person other than an Executive Officer or employee or any other individual having a relationship, which, in the opinion of the Board of Directors, would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director. 
 Under the definitions outlined it is our opinion that Michael Sevell and Mark Stogdill are independent directors.

 We are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and are not required to provide the information under this item.
