 PART I Item 1. Business General Prudential Bancorp is a Pennsylvania corporation that was incorporated in June 2013. It is the successor corporation to Prudential Bancorp, Inc. of Pennsylvania Old Prudential Bancorp ), the former stock holding company for Prudential Bank (the Bank and formally known as Prudential Savings Bank ), a Pennsylvania-chartered, FDIC-insured savings bank, after the completion in October 2013 of the mutual-to-stock conversion of Prudential Mutual Holding Company (the MHC ), the former mutual holding company for the Bank. The mutual-to-stock conversion was completed on October 9, 2013. In connection with the conversion, Prudential Bancorp sold 7,141,602 shares of common stock at 10.00 per share in a public offering. In addition, 2,403,207 shares were issued in exchange for the outstanding shares of common stock of Old Prudential Bancorp held by shareholders other than the MHC. Each share of Old Prudential Bancorp s common stock owned by the public was exchanged for 0.9442 shares of Prudential Bancorp common stock. Gross proceeds from the conversion and offering were approximately 71.4 million. Upon completion of the offering and the exchange, 9,544,809 shares of common stock of Prudential Bancorp were issued and outstanding. As of January 1, 2017, the Company completed its acquisition of Polonia Bancorp, Inc. Polonia Bancorp and Polonia Bank, Polonia s wholly owned subsidiary. Polonia Bancorp and Polonia Bank were merged with and into the Company and the Bank, respectively. As a result of Polonia shareholder stock and cash elections and the related proration provisions of the merger agreement, Prudential Bancorp issued approximately 1,274,197 shares of its common stock and approximately 18.9 million in the merger. Prudential Bancorp s business activity primarily consists of the ownership of the Bank s common stock. Prudential Bancorp does not own or lease any property. Instead, it uses the premises, equipment and other property of the Bank. Accordingly, the information set forth in this annual report, including the consolidated financial statements and related financial data, relates primarily to the Bank. As a bank holding company, Prudential Bancorp is subject to the regulation of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System Federal Reserve Board ). The Company s results of operations are primarily dependent on the results of the Bank. As of September 30, 2021, the Company, on a consolidated basis, had total assets of approximately 1.1 billion, total deposits of approximately 711.5 million, and total stockholders equity of approximately 130.5 million. The Bank is a community-oriented savings bank headquartered in South Philadelphia which was originally organized in 1886 as a Pennsylvania-chartered building and loan association known as The South Philadelphia Building and Loan Association No. 2. The Bank grew through a number of mergers with other institutions with the last merger being with Polonia Bank completed in January 2017. The Bank converted to a Pennsylvania-chartered savings bank in August 2004. The banking office network currently consists of the headquarters and main office and nine additional full-service branch offices. Seven of the banking offices are located in Philadelphia (Philadelphia County), one is in Drexel Hill, Delaware County and one is in Huntingdon Valley, Montgomery County, Pennsylvania. The Bank maintains ATMs at all of the banking offices. The Bank also provides on-line and mobile banking services. We are primarily engaged in attracting deposits from the general public and using those funds to invest in loans and securities. The Company s principal sources of funds are deposits, repayments of loans and mortgage-backed securities, maturities and calls of investment securities and interest-bearing deposits, funds provided from operations and funds borrowed from the Federal Home Loan Bank FHLB of Pittsburgh. These funds are primarily used for the origination of various loan types including single-family residential mortgage loans, construction and land development loans, non-residential or commercial real estate mortgage loans, home equity loans and lines of credit, commercial business loans and consumer loans. Traditionally, the Bank focused on originating long-term, single-family residential mortgage loans for portfolio. However, in recent years the focus has shifted to emphasizing commercial real estate and construction and land development lending. Construction and land development loans increased from 145.5 million or 22.3 of the 
 4 

Table of Contents 
 total loan portfolio at September 30, 2017 to 205.4 million or 29.0 of the total loan portfolio at September 30, 2021. The Company also increased its commercial real estate loans from 127.6 million or 19.6 of the total loan portfolio at September 30, 2017 to 166.0 million or 23.5 of the total loan portfolio at September 30, 2021 and our commercial business loans increased from 488,000 or 0.1 of our total loan portfolio at September 30, 2017 to 57.2 million or 8.1 of the total loan portfolio at September 30, 2021. See - Lending Activities and -Asset Quality The investment and mortgage-backed securities portfolio decreased by 117.2 million to 326.0 million at September 30, 2021 from 443.2 million at September 30, 2020. This decrease was primarily due to sales and paydowns of investment and mortgage-backed securities. The Company recorded approximately 1.6 million in gains on sale of investment and mortgage-backed securities during fiscal 2021. At September 30, 2021, the investment and mortgage-backed securities available for sale had an aggregate net unrealized gain of 7.7 million compared with an aggregate net unrealized gain of 13.4 million as of September 30, 2020. At September 30, 2021, the Company s non-performing assets totaled 12.5 million or 1.1 of total assets as compared to 13.0 million or 1.2 of total assets at September 30, 2020. Non-performing assets at September 30, 2021 included three construction loans aggregating 4.1 million, 18 one-to-four family residential mortgage loans aggregating 3.0 million, two commercial real estate loans aggregating 1.3 million and two construction loans aggregating 4.1 million that were foreclosed during the third quarter of fiscal 2021 and are held as other real estate owned. At September 30, 2021, the Company had two loans totaling 1.1 million that were classified as troubled debt restructurings TDRs ). One TDR is on non-accrual and consists of a 391,000 loan secured by a single-family residential property which is performing in accordance with the restructured terms. The remaining TDR is a 705,000 commercial real estate loan classified as non-accrual and is part of a lending relationship totaling 6.0 million (after taking into account the previously disclosed 1.9 million write-down recognized during the quarter ending March 31, 2017 related to this borrowing relationship as well as the two construction loans noted above that became other real estate owned during the quarter ended June 30, 2021). The primary project of the borrower (the development of a 169-unit townhouse project in Bristol Borough, Pennsylvania) is the subject of litigation between the Bank and the borrower. As previously disclosed, subsequent to the commencement of the litigation, the borrower filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 11 (Reorganization) of the federal bankruptcy code in June 2017. The Bank moved the underlying litigation with the borrower noted above from state court to the federal bankruptcy court in which the bankruptcy proceeding is being heard. The state litigation is stayed pending the resolution of the bankruptcy proceedings. As of September 30, 2021, 35 units have been sold in the project resulting in 875,000 applied against the outstanding debt owed the Bank. As of September 30, 2021, the Company had reviewed 8.4 million of loans for possible impairment of which 8.4 million was classified substandard compared to 13.0 million reviewed for possible impairment and 13.0 million of which was classified substandard as of September 30, 2020. As of September 30, 2021, the allowance for loan losses totaled 8.5 million, or 1.4 of total loans and 101.6 of total non-performing loans (which included loans acquired from Polonia Bank at their fair value) at September 30, 2021. See - Asset Quality . The main office is located at 1834 West Oregon Avenue, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and the Company s telephone number is (215) 755-1500. The Company files with the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC and makes available, free of charge, through its website, its Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, Proxy Statements on Schedule 14A, and all amendments to those reports as soon as reasonably practicable after the reports are electronically filed with the SEC. These reports can be obtained on the Company s website at https://www.psbanker.com by following the link, About Us, followed by Investor Relations. The information contained on or connected to our website is not incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Market Area and Competition Most of Prudential Bancorp s business activities are conducted within a few hours drive from Philadelphia and include eastern Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Delaware and southern New York. We face substantial competition from other financial institutions in our service area, especially from many local community banks, as well as many local credit unions. Competition among financial institutions is based upon a number 
 5 

Table of Contents 
 of factors, including the quality of services rendered, interest rates offered on deposit accounts, interest rates charged on loans and other credit services, service charges, the convenience of banking facilities, locations and hours of operation and, in the case of loans to larger commercial borrowers, applicable lending limits. Many of the financial institutions with which we compete have greater financial resources than we do, and offer a wider range of deposit and lending products. We believe that an attractive niche exists serving small to medium-sized business customers not adequately served by our larger competitors, and we will seek opportunities to build commercial relationships to complement our retail strategy. We believe small to medium-sized businesses will continue to respond in a positive manner to the attentive and highly personalized service we provide. Lending Activities General. At September 30, 2021, the net loan portfolio totaled 618.2 million or 56.2 of total assets. The Company has changed its lending philosophy and increased its investment in loans for construction and land development, commercial real estate and commercial business loans which comprised in the aggregate 60.6 of the loan portfolio at September 30, 2021. Management believes it has the expertise to underwrite these types of loans which management believes will enhance the Company s earnings while reducing interest rate risk due to the generally shorter contractual maturity of such loans. At September 30, 2021, the Company still held 202.3 million of residential real estate loans collateralized by one-to-four family, also known as single-family , residential properties located primarily in the Company s market area. The types of loans that we may originate are subject to federal and state banking laws and regulations. Interest rates charged by us on loans are affected principally by the demand for such loans and the supply of money available for lending purposes and the rates offered by competitors. These factors are, in turn, affected by general and economic conditions, the monetary policy of the federal government, including the Federal Reserve Board, legislative tax policies and governmental budgetary matters. Loan Portfolio Composition . The following table shows the composition of the loan portfolio by type of loan at the dates indicated.

 (1) Includes home equity loans and lines of credit. 
 The Bank originates construction and development loans and commercial real estate loans with fixed rates and shorter contractual maturities (than is generally the case for residential mortgage loans). To a lesser extent, single-family residential mortgage loans are originated for sale on the secondary market in order to mitigate interest rate risk and to increase non-interest income. Loan Originations. The Bank s lending activities are subject to underwriting standards and loan origination procedures established by our Board of Directors and management. Loan originations are obtained through a variety of sources, including existing customers as well as new customers obtained from referrals and local advertising and promotional efforts. Consumer loan applications are taken at any of our offices while loan applications for all other types of loans, including home equity and home equity lines of credit, are taken only at our main office. All loan applications are processed and underwritten centrally at our executive office in Huntingdon Valley, Pennsylvania. Single-family residential mortgage loans are generally written on standardized documents used by the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation FHLMC or Freddie Mac and Federal National Mortgage Association FNMA or Fannie Mae ). Property valuations of loans secured by real estate are undertaken by independent third-party appraisers approved by the board of directors and are reviewed internally before acceptance. At both September 30, 2021 and September 30, 2020, the Company had no residential real estate loans in portfolio that would be considered subprime loans, which we define as mortgage loans advanced to borrowers who do not qualify for loans bearing market interest rates

Table of Contents 
 because of problems with their credit history. The Bank does not originate and has not in the past originated subprime loans. We also purchase participation interests in larger balance loans, typically commercial real estate and construction and land development loans, from other financial institutions in our market area. Such participations are reviewed for compliance, are underwritten independently in accordance with our underwriting criteria and are approved before they are purchased by the Management Loan Committee and one of the following: the President s Committee, the Executive Committee or the full Board, depending upon the dollar amount of the participation interest being purchased. Generally, loan purchases have been without any recourse to the seller, but on occasion we have obtained such provisions. However, we actively monitor the performance of such loans through the receipt of regular updates, including inspection reports, from the lead lender regarding the loan s performance, discussing the loan with the lead lender on a regular basis and receiving copies of updated financial statements of the borrower from the lead lender. These loans are subjected to regular internal reviews in accordance with our loan policy. The Bank typically holds a 100 interest in construction and land development loans. The Bank has in the past and currently reserves the option to sell participation interests. We generally have sold participation interests in loans only when a loan would exceed the Bank s internal and/or legal loans to one borrower limits. With respect to the sale of participation interests in loans, we have typically received commitments to purchase the participation interests offered prior to the time the loan is closed. See -Lending Activities - Construction and Land Development Lending. As part of the Bank s loan policy, we are permitted, to make loans to one borrower and related entities in an aggregate amount of up to 15 of the capital accounts of the Bank which consist of the aggregate of its capital, surplus, undivided profits, capital securities and allowance for loan losses. At September 30, 2021, the Bank s internal guidance limit is 15.0 million to one borrower or borrowing relationship as a threshold. The Bank is permitted to exceed such limit in certain situations subject to the (i) approval of the Board of Directors and (ii) subject to the overall legal/regulatory lending limit which was calculated to be 19.9 million at September 30, 2021. At September 30, 2021, our three largest loans to one borrower and related entities amounted to 16.0 million, 16.0 million and 14.9 million. The largest relationship is with a real estate developer located in northern New Jersey and consists of a multi-family residential housing construction project, two commercial real estate loans and a personal line of credit. The second largest relationship consists of a participation interest in a 16.0 million commercial line of credit secured by commercial real estate in central and northern New Jersey. The third largest relationship consists of a participation interest in a construction loan to construct a 30 story, 102 unit mixed-use luxury apartment building in Manhattan, New York. The three relationships are all performing in accordance with contractual terms. For more information regarding these loans, see -Lending Activities - Construction and Land Development Lending.

 One-to-Four Family Residential Mortgage Lending. One of the Bank s primary lending activities continues to be the origination or purchase of loans secured by first mortgages on one-to-four family residential properties located in the Company s market area. Our single-family residential mortgage loans are obtained through the lending department and branch personnel. The balance of such loans has decreased from 351.3 million or 53.8 of total loans at September 30, 2017 to 202.3 million, or 28.6 of total loans at September 30, 2021. The percentage of total loans as well as the total amount that such loans have represented of the loan portfolio has decreased as our focus has shifted to the origination of commercial real estate loans, construction and land development loans and commercial business loans. Single-family residential mortgage loans generally are underwritten on terms and documentation conforming to guidelines issued by Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae. We currently offer adjustable-rate mortgage and balloon loans, which are structured as shorter term fixed-rate loans (generally 10 years or less) followed by a final payment of the full amount of the principal due at the maturity date. Due to the interest rate environment, originations of such loans have been limited in recent years. At September 30, 2021, 32.9 million, or 16.3 , of our one-to-four family residential loan portfolio consisted of adjustable-rate loans, including hybrid loans. We also originate fixed-rate, fully amortizing mortgage loans with maturities of 15, 20 or 30 years, for resale in the secondary market on a servicing release basis. While continuing to operate in the historically low current interest rate environment and to assist in the implementation of our asset/liability management policy, we have placed an emphasis on the origination of single-family mortgage loans to be sold in the secondary markets. We underwrite one-to-four family residential mortgage loans with loan-to-value ratios of up to 95 , provided that the borrower obtains private mortgage insurance on loans that exceed 80 of the appraised value or sales price, whichever is less, of the secured property. We also require that title insurance, hazard insurance and, if appropriate, flood insurance be maintained on all properties securing real estate loans. A licensed appraiser appraises all properties securing one-to-four family first mortgage loans. Our mortgage loans generally include due-on-sale clauses which provide us with the contractual right to deem the loan immediately due and payable in the event the borrower transfers ownership of the property. Our single-family residential mortgage loans also include home equity loans and lines of credit, which amounted to 2.1 million and 6.9 million, respectively, at September 30, 2021. The unused portion of home equity lines was 6.6 million at such date. Our home equity loans are fully amortizing and have terms to maturity of up to 20 years. While home equity loans also are secured by the borrower s residence, we generally obtain a second mortgage position on these loans. Our lending policy requires that our home equity loans have loan-to-value ratios, when combined with any first mortgage, of a maximum 80 or less at time of origination, although the preponderance of our home equity loans have combined loan-to-value ratios of 75 or less at time of origination. We also offer home equity revolving lines of credit with interest tied to the Wall Street Journal prime rate plus a stipulated margin. Generally, we have a second mortgage on the borrower s residence as collateral on our home equity lines. In addition, our home equity lines generally have loan-to-value ratios (combined with any loan secured by a first mortgage) of 75 or less at time of origination. Our customers may apply for home equity lines as well as home equity loans at any banking office. Construction and Land Development Lending. We have maintained our emphasis on construction and land development loan originations because construction loans have shorter terms to maturity, provide an attractive yield and generally have either higher fixed interest rates or adjustable interest rates. At September 30, 2021, our construction and loan development loans amounted to 205.4 million, or 29.0 of our total loan portfolio. This amount includes 80.6 million of undisbursed loans in process. The average size of our construction and land development loans, excluding loans to our largest lending relationship, was approximately 2.2 million at September 30, 2021. Our construction loan portfolio has increased substantially since September 30, 2017 when construction loans amounted to 145.5 million or 22.3 of our total loan portfolio.

 Other than our loan participations, loans to finance the construction of condominium projects or single-family homes and subdivisions are generally offered to experienced builders in our primary market area with whom we have an established relationship. Residential construction and development loans are offered with terms of up to 36 months although typically the terms are 12 to 24 months. The maximum loan-to-value limit applicable to these loans is 75 of the appraised post construction value and the policy does not require amortization of the principal during the term of the loan. We often establish interest reserves and obtain personal and corporate guarantees as additional security on the construction loans. Interest reserves are used to pay the monthly interest payments during the development phase of the loan and are treated as an addition to the loan balance. Interest reserves pose an additional risk to the Company if it does not become aware of deterioration in the borrower s financial condition before the interest reserve is fully utilized. In order to help monitor the risk, financial statements and tax returns are obtained from borrowers on an annual basis. Additionally, construction loans are reviewed at least annually pursuant to a third-party loan review. Construction loan proceeds are disbursed periodically in increments as construction progresses and as inspection by approved appraisers or loan inspector warrants. Construction loans are negotiated on an individual basis but typically have floating rates of interest based upon the Wall Street Journal prime rate plus a stipulated margin. Additional fees may be charged as funds are disbursed. In addition to interest payments during the term of the construction loan, we typically require that payments to reduce the principal outstanding be made as units are completed and released. Generally, such principal payments must be equal to 110 of the amount attributable to the acquisition and development of the lot plus 100 of the amount attributable to construction of the individual home. We typically permit a pre-determined limited number of model homes to be constructed on an unsold or speculative basis. All other units must be pre-sold before we will disburse funds for construction. Construction loans also include loans to acquire land and loans to develop the basic infrastructure, such as roads and sewers. The majority of the construction loans are secured by properties located in our primary lending area. Set forth below is a brief description of the five largest construction loans or loan relationships. The largest construction loan is in the amount of 10.0 million of which 9.8 million had been disbursed as of September 30, 2021. This loan was originated in March 2017 and is a participation interest in a 26.1 million loan purchased from another financial institution. The proceeds were used to construct 66 residential units and 9,000 square feet of retail space in Jersey City, New Jersey. The project was approximately 100.0 complete as of September 30, 2021. The loan is performing in accordance with its contractual terms. The second largest construction loan is in the amount of 9.5 million of which 9.5 million had been disbursed as of September 30, 2021. This loan was originated in February 2019 and is a participation interest in a 33.0 million loan purchased from another financial institution. The proceeds were used to construct 201 apartments in East Orange, New Jersey. The project was approximately 100.0 complete as of September 30, 2021. The loan is performing in accordance with its contractual terms. The third largest construction loan is in the amount of 9.1 million of which 9.0 million had been disbursed as of September 30, 2021. This loan was originated in November 2018. The proceeds were used to construct 208 apartments in East Rutherford, New Jersey. The project was approximately 100.0 complete as of September 30, 2021. The loan is performing in accordance with its contractual terms. The fourth largest construction loan is also in the amount of 10.0 million of which 9.0 million had been disbursed as of September 30, 2021. The loan was originated in March 2017 and is a participation interest in a 18.8 million loan purchased from another financial institution. The proceeds were used to construct 89 apartment units and seven retail space in Newark, New Jersey. The project was approximately 100.0 complete as of September 30, 2021. The loan is performing in accordance with its contractual terms. The fifth largest construction loan is in the amount of 8.3 million of which 8.3 million had been disbursed as of September 30, 2021. This loan was originated in June 2018 The proceeds were used to construct a 41 unit residential apartment complex in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The project was approximately 93.0 complete as of September 30, 2021. The loan is performing in accordance with its contractual terms . Construction financing is generally considered to involve a higher degree of credit risk than long-term financing on improved, owner-occupied real estate. Risk of loss on a construction loan depends largely upon the accuracy of the 
 10 

Table of Contents 
 initial estimate of the property s value at completion of construction compared to the estimated costs, including interest, of construction and other assumptions. Because of the uncertainties inherent in estimating construction costs, as well as the market value of the completed project and the effects of governmental regulation on real property, it is relatively difficult to evaluate accurately the total funds required to complete a project and the completed project loan-to-value ratio. Additionally, if the estimate of value proves to be inaccurate, we may be confronted with a project, when completed, having a value less than the loan amount. Furthermore, because construction loans require active monitoring of the building process, including cost comparisons and on-site inspections, these loans are more difficult and costly to monitor. Multi-Family Residential and Commercial Real Estate Loans. At September 30, 2021, multi-family residential and commercial real estate loans amounted in the aggregate to 242.1 million or 34.2 of the total loan portfolio. The commercial real estate and multi-family residential real estate loan portfolio consists primarily of loans secured by small office buildings, strip shopping centers, small apartment buildings and other properties used for commercial and multi-family residential purposes located in the Company s market area. At September 30, 2021, the average commercial and multi-family real estate loan size was approximately 1.2 million. At September 30, 2021, the largest relationship consists of a participation interest in a 14.9 million variable rate loan secured by a 102 unit mixed-use luxury apartment building in Manhattan, New York. The second largest multi-family residential or commercial real estate loan at September 30, 2021 was a 11.5 million fixed-rate loan secured by a 316 unit apartment complex located in East Rutherford, New Jersey with retail space on the first floor. Substantially all of the properties securing the multi-family residential and commercial real estate loans are located in the Company s primary lending area. Although terms for commercial real estate and multi-family residential loans vary, our underwriting standards generally allow for terms up to 15 years with loan-to-value ratios of not more than 75 . Most of the loans are structured with balloon payments of 10 years or less and amortization periods of up to 25 years. Interest rates are either fixed or adjustable, based upon designated market indices such as the Wall Street Journal prime rate plus a stipulated margin or, with respect to our multi-family residential loans, the Average Contract Interest Rate for previously occupied houses as reported by the Federal Housing Finance Board. In addition, fees are charged to the borrower at the origination of the loan. Commercial real estate and multi-family residential real estate lending involves different risks than single-family residential lending. These risks include larger loans to individual borrowers and loan payments that are dependent upon the successful operation of the project or the borrower s business. These risks can be affected by supply and demand conditions in the project s market area for rental housing units, office and retail space and other commercial space. We attempt to minimize these risks by limiting loans to proven businesses, only considering properties with existing operating performance which can be analyzed, using conservative debt coverage ratios in our underwriting, and periodically monitoring the operation of the business or project and the physical condition of the property. Various aspects of commercial and multi-family loan transactions are evaluated in an effort to mitigate the additional risk in these types of loans. In our underwriting procedures, consideration is given to the stability of the property s cash flow history, future operating projections, current and projected occupancy levels, location and physical condition. Generally, we impose a debt service ratio (the ratio of net cash flows from operations before the payment of debt service to debt service) of not less than 120 . We also evaluate the credit and financial condition of the borrower, and if applicable, the guarantor. With respect to loan participation interests we purchase, we underwrite the loans as if we were the originating lender. Appraisal reports prepared by independent appraisers are reviewed by us prior to the closing of the loan. In recent years, the Company has shifted its emphasis to originate for portfolio more multi-family residential and commercial real estate loans, due to their higher yields and shorter duration. Commercial Business Loans. At September 30, 2021, commercial business loans amounted to 57.2 million, or 8.1 of our loan portfolio. Commercial business loans are made to small to mid-sized businesses in our market area primarily to provide working capital. Small business loans may have adjustable or fixed rates of interest and generally have terms of three years 
 11 

Table of Contents 
 or less but may be as long as 15 years. Our commercial business loans have historically been underwritten based on the creditworthiness of the borrower and generally require a debt service coverage ratio of at least 120 . In addition, we generally obtain personal guarantees from the principals of the borrower with respect to commercial business loans and frequently obtain real estate as additional collateral. Commercial business lending generally involves greater risk than residential mortgage lending and involves risks that are different from those associated with single-family residential, multi-family residential, and commercial real estate lending. Real estate lending is generally considered to be collateral-based lending with loan amounts based on predetermined loan to collateral values, and liquidation of the underlying real estate collateral is viewed as the primary source of repayment in the event of borrower default. Although commercial business loans are often collateralized by equipment, inventory, accounts receivable, and/or other business assets, the liquidation of collateral in the event of a borrower default is often an insufficient source of repayment because accounts receivable may be uncollectible and inventories and equipment may be obsolete or of limited use, among other things. Accordingly, the repayment of a commercial business loan depends primarily on the creditworthiness of the borrower (and any guarantors), while liquidation of collateral is a secondary and often insufficient source of repayment. Consumer Lending Activities. We offer various types of consumer loans such as loans secured by deposit accounts and unsecured personal loans. Consumer loans are originated primarily through existing and walk-in customers and direct advertising. At September 30, 2021, 530,000, or 0.1 of the total loan portfolio consisted of consumer loans. Consumer loans generally have higher interest rates and shorter terms than residential loans. However, consumer loans have additional credit risk due to the type of collateral securing the loan or in some cases the absence of collateral. Loan Approval Procedures and Authority. Our Board of Directors establishes the Bank s lending policies and procedures. Our various lending policies are reviewed at least annually by our management team and the Board in order to consider modifications as a result of market conditions, regulatory changes and other factors. The Company maintains separate loan approval committees with tiered levels of approval authority. The Management Loan Committee, comprised of the Chief Operating Officer COO ), the Chief Lending Officer CLO ), the Chief Credit Officer CCO ), the Chief Financial Officer CFO ), the Compliance Risk Officer CRO and the Controller has lending approval authority of up to 3.0 million. The next tier in the approval process, with an approval range of 3.0 million to 10.0 million, is the President s Loan committee, comprised of the Chief Executive Officer CEO and the COO. All loans in excess of 10.0 million must be presented to the full Board of Directors for approval. All loans submitted to the top two tiers of approval must be recommended for approval by the Management Loan Committee. Single-family residential loans originated for sale into the secondary market are processed through underwriting software and are reviewed for approval by two senior officers in the credit department. Asset Quality General. One of our key objectives has been, and continues to be, maintaining a high level of asset quality. In addition to maintaining credit standards for new originations which we believe are prudent, we are proactive in our loan monitoring, collection and workout processes in dealing with delinquent or problem loans. We have also retained an independent, third party to undertake reviews of the credit quality of a random sample of new loans as well as all of our major loans on at least an annual basis. Reports listing all delinquent accounts are generated and reviewed by management on a monthly basis. These reports include information regarding all loans 30 days or more delinquent as to principal and/or interest and all real estate owned properties and are provided to the Board of Directors. The procedures we take with respect to delinquencies vary depending on the nature of the loan, period and cause of delinquency and whether the borrower is habitually delinquent. When a borrower fails to make a required payment on a loan, we take a number of steps to have the borrower cure the delinquency and restore the loan to current status. We generally send the borrower a written notice of non-payment after the loan is first past due. Our guidelines provide that telephone, written correspondence and/or face-to-face contact will be attempted to ascertain the reasons for delinquency and the prospects of repayment. When contact is made with the borrower at any time prior to foreclosure, we will attempt to obtain full payment, work out a repayment schedule with the borrower

 to avoid foreclosure or, in some instances, accept a deed in lieu of foreclosure. In the event payment is not then received or the loan is not otherwise satisfied, additional letters and telephone calls generally are made. If the loan is still not brought current or satisfied and it becomes necessary for us to take legal action, which typically occurs after a loan is 90 days or more delinquent, we will commence foreclosure proceedings against any real property that secures the loan. If a foreclosure action is instituted and the loan is not brought current, paid in full, or refinanced before foreclosure sale, the property securing the loan generally is sold at foreclosure and, if purchased by us, becomes real estate owned. Since there has not been a significant increase in recent years in the one-to-four family residential loans that are 90 days past due, the Company was not adversely impacted by any recent government programs related to the foreclosure process. On loans where the collection of principal or interest payments is doubtful, the accrual of interest income ceases non-accrual loans). On loans 90 days or more past due as to principal and/or interest payments, our policy is to discontinue accruing additional interest and reverse any interest previously accrued. On occasion, this action may be taken earlier if the financial condition of the borrower raises significant concern with regard to his/her ability to service the debt in accordance with the terms of the loan agreement. Interest income is not accrued on these loans until the borrower s financial condition and payment record demonstrate an ability to service the debt. Property acquired by the Bank through foreclosure is initially recorded at the lower of cost, which is the carrying value of the loan, or fair value at the date of acquisition, which is fair value of the related assets at the date of foreclosure, less estimated costs to sell. Thereafter, if there is a further deterioration in value, we charge earnings for the diminution in value. The Bank s policy is to obtain an appraisal on real estate subject to foreclosure proceedings prior to the time of foreclosure if the property is located outside the Company s market area or consists of other than single-family residential property. We obtain re-appraisals on a periodic basis, generally on at least an annual basis, on foreclosed properties. We also conduct inspections on foreclosed properties. We account for our impaired loans in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. An impaired loan generally is one for which it is more likely than not, based on current information, that the lender will not collect all the amounts due under the contractual terms of the loan. Large groups of smaller balance, homogeneous loans are collectively evaluated for impairment. Loans collectively evaluated for impairment include smaller balance commercial real estate loans, residential real estate loans and consumer loans. These loans are evaluated as a group because they have similar characteristics and performance experience. Larger commercial real estate, construction and land development and commercial business loans are individually evaluated for impairment on at least a quarterly basis by management. All loans classified as substandard as part of the loan review process or due to delinquency status are evaluated for potential impairment. There were 8.4 million of loans evaluated for impairment as of September 30, 2021 (of which 6.0 million is related to one relationship), consisting of 4.1 million of construction and land development loans, 3.0 million of one-to-four family residential loans and 1.3 million of commercial real estate loans, all of which were classified as substandard. Although no specific allocations were applied to these loans, there were charge-offs totaling 40,000 incured during fiscal 2021. As of September 30, 2021, there were eighteen loans totaling 8.1 million designated as special mention loans consisting of four non-residential real estate loans aggregating 6.7 million and thirteen single-family residential loans aggregating 1.4 million. As of September 30, 2020, there were twenty-one loans totaling 11.4 million designated as special mention loans, consisting of eight non-residential real estate loans aggregating 10.0 million and thirteen single-family residential loans aggregating 1.4 million. Federal regulations and our policies require that we utilize an internal asset classification system as a means of reporting problem and potential problem assets. We have incorporated an internal asset classification system, consistent with Federal banking regulations, as a part of our credit monitoring system. We currently classify problem and potential problem assets as special mention , substandard, doubtful or loss assets. An asset is considered substandard if it is inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. Substandard assets include those characterized by the distinct possibility that the insured institution will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. Assets classified as doubtful have all of the weaknesses inherent in those classified substandard with the added characteristic that the weaknesses present make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, highly questionable and improbable. Assets classified as loss are those considered uncollectible and of such little value that their continuance as assets without the establishment of a specific loss reserve is not warranted. Assets which do not currently expose the insured institution to 
 13 

Table of Contents 
 sufficient risk to warrant classification in one of the aforementioned categories but possess weaknesses are required to be designated special mention. When an insured institution classifies one or more assets, or portions thereof, as substandard or doubtful, it is required that a general valuation allowance for loan losses be established for loan losses in accordance with established methodology. General valuation allowances represent loss allowances which have been established to recognize the inherent losses associated with lending activities, but which, unlike specific allocations, have not been allocated to particular problem assets. When an insured institution classifies one or more assets, or portions thereof, as loss, it is required to charge off such amount. Our allowance for loan losses includes a portion which is allocated by type of loan, based primarily upon our periodic reviews of the risk elements within the various categories of loans. The specific components relate to certain impaired loans. The general components cover non-classified loans and are based on historical loss experience adjusted for qualitative factors in response to changes in risk and market conditions. Our management believes that, based on information currently available, the allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level which covers all known and inherent losses that are both probable and reasonably estimable at each reporting date. However, actual losses are dependent upon future events and, as such, further additions to the level of the allowance for loan losses may become necessary. We review and classify assets on no less frequently than a quarterly basis and the Board of Directors is provided with reports on our classified and criticized assets. We classify assets in accordance with the management guidelines described above. At September 30, 2021 and 2020, we had no assets classified as doubtful or loss and 8.4 million and 13.0 million, respectively, of assets classified as substandard. In addition, there were 8.1 million and 11.4 million of loans designated as special mention as of September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. In response to the current situation surrounding the continuing COVID-19 pandemic, the Company has provided and continues to provide assistance to its customers in a variety of ways. The Company participated in the Paycheck Protection Program offered under the CARES Act as a Small Business Administration SBA lender. During the fiscal year 2020, we had originated 63 requests for Paycheck Protection Program PPP loans totaling approximately 5.1 million. These loans were sold during the quarter ended September 30, 2020 at a net gain of 111,000. During fiscal 2021, we acted as a broker for a third party for our borrowers to utilize the the second PPP loan program. We are working closely with our loan customers to effectively manage our portfolio through the ongoing uncertainty surrounding the duration, impact and government response to the crisis. The CARES Act provided guidance around the modification of loans as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, which outlined, among other criteria, that short-term modifications made on a good faith basis to borrowers who were current as defined under the CARES Act prior to any relief, are not TDRs. This includes short-term modifications such as payment deferrals, fee waivers, extensions of repayment terms, or other delays in payment that are insignificant. Borrowers are considered current under the CARES Act and related regulatory guidance if they are less than 30 days past due on their contractual payments at the time a modification program is implemented. During the year ended September 30, 2020, the Company made COVID-19 pandemic related modifications on 160 loans aggregating to 149.7 million. All of these borrowers had resumed making payments as of September 30, 2020. Loan modifications in accordance with the CARES Act and related regulatory guidance are still subject to an evaluation in regard to determining whether or not a loan is deemed to be impaired .

The following table sets forth information regarding non-performing loans and real estate owned. The Company s general policy is to cease accruing interest on loans which are 90 days or more past due and to reverse all accrued interest. At September 30, 2021, all of the loans listed as 90 or more days past due in the table above were in non-accrual status. At September 30, 2021, the Company had two loans aggregating 1.1 million that were classified as TDRs. As of September 30, 2021, one of such loans in the amount of 705,000 was classified as non-performing and is related to one 6.0 million non-performing lending relationship. The remaining TDR is also on non-accrual and consists of a 391,000 loan secured by a single-family property. The following table shows the amounts of non-performing assets (defined as non-accruing loans, accruing loans 90 days or more past due as to principal or interest and real estate owned) at the dates indicated. There were no loans more than 90 days delinquent as to principal and/or interest and continuing to accrue interest at any of the dates presented in this table.

 (iv) September 30, 2018, 5.5 million of TDRs that were classified non-performing consisting of two construction and land development loans in the amount of 4.2 million, two one-to-four family loans aggregating 606,000 and one commercial real estate loan in the amount of 712,000; and (v) September 30, 2017, 5.7 million of TDRs that were classified non-performing consisting of a 3.6 million construction and land development loan, a 1.4 million one-to-four family loan and five commercial real estate loans aggregating 1.6 million. (2) Real estate owned balances are shown net of related loss allowances and consist solely of real property. 
 Interest income on non-accrual loans is recognized on the cash basis until either the loan is paid-in full or the Bank determines after a significant payment history has been achieved to warrant the involved loan being classified as a performing loan and being returned to accruing status. There was 18,000 of such interest recognized during fiscal 2021 while there was 13,000, 123,000, 85,000 and 161,000 of such interest recognized for non-accrual loans for fiscal 2020, fiscal 2019, fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017, respectively. Approximately 513,000 in additional interest income would have been recognized during the year ended September 30, 2021 if non-accrual loans had been performing during fiscal 2021. At September 30, 2021, the Company s non-performing assets totaled 12.5 million or 1.1 of total assets as compared to 13.0 million or 1.2 of total assets at September 30, 2020. Non-performing assets at September 30, 2021 included three construction loans aggregating 4.1 million, 18 single-family residential loans aggregating 3.0 million, and two commercial real estate loans aggregating 1.3 million. At September 30, 2021, the Company had two loans aggregating 1.1 million that were classified as TDRs, both of which are included in non-performing assets. One TDR is on non-accrual and consists of a 390,000 loan secured by a single-family property. The other TDR in the amount of 705,000 is also classified as non-accrual and is part of a non-performing lending relationship totaling 6.0 million (after taking into account the 1.9 million write-down recognized during fiscal 2018 related to this borrowing relationship and two other loans which became other real estate owned during the quarter ended June 30, 2021). The primary project of the borrower (the development of a 169-unit townhouse project in Bristol Borough, Pennsylvania) is the subject of litigation between the Bank and the borrower. Subsequent to the commencement of the litigation, the borrower filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 11 (Reorganization) of the federal bankruptcy code in September 2018. The Bank has moved the underlying litigation noted above with the borrower and the Bank from state court to the federal bankruptcy court in which the bankruptcy proceeding is being heard. The state litigation is stayed pending the resolution of the bankruptcy proceedings. Allowance for Loan Losses. The allowance for loan losses is established through a provision for loan losses charged to expense. We maintain the allowance at a level believed, to the best of management s knowledge, to cover all known and inherent losses in the portfolio that are both probable and reasonable to estimate at each reporting date. Management reviews the allowance for loan losses on no less than a quarterly basis in order to identify those inherent losses and to assess the overall collection probability for the loan portfolio. For each primary type of loan, we establish a loss factor reflecting an estimate of the known and inherent losses in such loan type using both a quantitative analysis as well as consideration of qualitative factors. Management s evaluation process includes, among other things, an analysis of delinquency trends, non-performing loan trends, the level of charge-offs and recoveries, prior loss experience, total loans outstanding, the volume of loan originations, the type, size and geographic concentration of our loans, the value of collateral securing the loan, the borrower s ability to repay and repayment performance, the number of loans requiring heightened management oversight, local economic conditions and industry experience. The carrying value of loans is periodically evaluated and the allowance is adjusted accordingly. The establishment of the allowance for loan losses is significantly affected by management judgment and uncertainties and there is a likelihood that different amounts would be reported under different conditions or assumptions. Various regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review the allowance for loan losses. Such agencies may require us to make additional provisions for estimated loan losses based upon judgments that differ from those of management. Loans acquired from Polonia Bancorp amounted to 160.8 million for which there is no allowance for loan losses because these loans were recorded at fair value upon completion of the merger as of January 1, 2017. A general credit mark of 2.3 million was recorded in connection with completion of the acquisition and is being amortized over 30 years. As of September 30, 2021, our allowance for loan losses of 8.5 million was 1.4 of total loans receivable and 101.6 of non-performing loans.

 Charge-offs on loans totaled 40,000 and 144,000 for the years ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Management has taken a prudent approach in writing down all substandard loans to the net realizable value of the applicable underlying collateral. Management will continue to monitor and modify the allowance for loan losses as conditions dictate. However, based on its comprehensive analysis, management believes that the amount maintained in the allowance for loan losses as of September 30, 2021 is adequate to absorb probable losses inherent in the portfolio. No assurances can be given that the level of allowance for loan losses will cover all of the inherent losses on our loans or that future adjustments to the allowance for loan losses will not be necessary if economic and other conditions differ substantially from the economic and other conditions used by management to determine the current level of the allowance for loan losses. The following table shows changes in the allowance for loan losses during the periods presented.

The aggregate allowance for loan losses increased by 2.9 million from September 30, 2019 to September 30, 2020, due to a provision of 3.0 million partially offset by a net charge off of 115,000 recorded during the period. The aggregate allowance for loan losses increased by 226,000 from September 30, 2018 to September 30, 2019, due to a provision of 100,000 combined with a net recovery of 126,000 recorded during the period. Fluctuations in the allowance may occur based on management s consideration of the known and inherent losses in the loan portfolio that are reasonably estimable as well as current qualitative and quantitative risk factors at the time of the analysis. Investment Activities General . We invest in securities in accordance with policies approved by our Board of Directors. The investment policy designates the President, COO, CFO and Controller as the Investment Committee, which is authorized by the Board to make the Bank s investments consistent with the investment policy. The Board of Directors of the Bank reviews all investment activity on a monthly basis. The investment policy is designed primarily to manage the interest rate sensitivity of the assets and liabilities, to generate a favorable return without incurring undue interest rate and credit risk, to complement the lending activities and to provide and maintain liquidity. The current investment policy generally permits investments in debt securities issued by the U.S. government and U.S. agencies, municipal bonds, and corporate debt obligations, as well as investments in preferred and common stock of government agencies and government sponsored enterprises such as Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and the Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh (federal agency securities) and, to a lesser extent, other equity securities. Securities in these categories are classified as investment securities for financial reporting purposes. The policy also permits investments in mortgage-backed securities, including pass-through securities issued and guaranteed by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae as well as collateralized mortgage obligations CMOs issued or backed by securities issued by these government sponsored agencies. Ginnie Mae is a government agency within the Department of Housing and Urban Development which is intended to help finance government-assisted housing programs. Ginnie Mae securities are backed by loans insured by the Federal Housing Administration, or guaranteed by the Department of Veterans Affairs. The timely payment of principal and interest on Ginnie Mae securities is guaranteed by Ginnie Mae and backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. Government. Freddie Mac is a private corporation chartered by the U.S. Government. Freddie Mac issues participation certificates backed principally by conventional mortgage loans. Freddie Mac guarantees the timely payment of interest and the ultimate return of principal on participation certificates. Fannie Mae is a private corporation chartered by the U.S. Congress with a mandate to establish a secondary market for mortgage loans. Fannie Mae guarantees the timely payment of principal and interest on Fannie Mae securities. Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae securities are not backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. Government.

 Investments in mortgage-backed securities involve the risk that actual prepayments will be greater than estimated prepayments over the life of the security, which may require adjustments to the amortization of any premium or accretion of any discount relating to such instruments thereby changing the net yield on such securities. There is also reinvestment risk associated with the cash flows from such securities or in the event such securities are redeemed by the issuer. In addition, the market value of such securities may be adversely affected by changes in interest rates. Further, privately issued mortgage-backed securities and CMOs also have a higher risk of default due to adverse changes in the creditworthiness of the issuer. Management s practice is generally to not invest in such securities. See further discussion in Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 herein. The Company has a portfolio of corporate debt securities with an investment grade rating from at least one national rating agency. In purchasing these types of securities, the Company looks for known publicly trading entities along with utilizing the credit department to underwrite each issuing entity as if it were a direct commercial loan. The mortgage-backed securities consist both of mortgage pass-through and CMOs guaranteed by Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac. The Company has portfolio municipal and government subdivisions securities which are graded at least A by at least one national rating agency. The securities are exempt from taxation. At September 30, 2021, the investment and mortgage-backed securities portfolio amounted to 326.0 million or 29.6 of total assets at such date. The largest component of the securities portfolio as of September 30, 2021 consisted of mortgage-backed securities which amounted to 139.6 million or 42.8 of the securities portfolio at September 30, 2021. In addition, we invest in corporate debt, state and political subdivisions, U.S Government and agency obligations and to a significantly lesser degree, other securities. The securities are classified at the time of acquisition as available for sale, held to maturity or trading. Securities classified as held to maturity must be purchased with the intent and ability to hold that security until its final maturity, and can be sold prior to maturity only under rare circumstances. Held-to-maturity securities are accounted for based upon the amortized cost of the security. Available-for-sale securities can be sold at any time based upon needs or market conditions. Available-for-sale securities are accounted for at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses on these securities, net of income tax provisions, reflected as accumulated other comprehensive income. At September 30, 2021, the Company had 20.1 million of investment and mortgage-backed securities classified as held to maturity, 305.9 million of investment and mortgage-backed securities classified as available for sale and no securities classified as trading securities. At September 30, 2021, we had no investments in a single issuer other than securities issued by U.S. Government agencies or U.S. Government sponsored enterprises, which had an aggregate book value in excess of 10 of the Company s stockholders equity. The following table sets forth certain information relating to the investment and mortgage-backed and equity securities portfolios at the dates indicated.

Deposits, loan repayments and prepayments, proceeds from sales of loans, cash flows generated from operations and FHLB advances are the primary sources of funds for use in lending, investing and for other general purposes. Deposits . We offer a variety of deposit accounts with a range of interest rates and terms. Deposits consist of checking, both interest-bearing and non-interest-bearing, money market, savings and certificate of deposit accounts. At September 30, 2021, 44.5 of the funds deposited with the Bank were in core deposits, which are deposits other than certificates of deposit and funds acquired through a broker. The flow of deposits is influenced significantly by general economic conditions, changes in money market rates, prevailing interest rates and competition. Retail deposits are obtained predominantly from the areas where the branch offices are located. We have historically relied primarily on customer service and long-standing relationships with customers to attract and retain these deposits; however, market interest rates and rates offered by competing financial institutions significantly affect the Bank s ability to attract and retain deposits. The interest rates offered on deposits are competitive in the market place. The Bank uses traditional means of advertising its deposit products, including broadcast and print media and generally does not solicit deposits from outside its market area.

From time to time we utilize advances from the FHLB of Pittsburgh as an alternative to retail deposits to fund the operations as part of the operating and liquidity strategy. See Liquidity and Capital Resources in Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation. These FHLB advances are collateralized primarily by certain mortgage loans and mortgage-backed securities and secondarily by an investment in capital stock of the FHLB of Pittsburgh. There are no specific credit covenants associated with these borrowings. FHLB advances are made pursuant to several different credit programs, each of which has its own interest rate and range of maturities. The maximum amount that the FHLB of Pittsburgh will advance to member institutions, including the Bank, fluctuates from time to time in accordance with the policies of the FHLB of Pittsburgh. At September 30, 2021, the Bank had 232.0 million in outstanding advances with the FHLB, and had the ability to obtain additional advances in the amount of 101.7 million. The Bank utilized the FHLB advances to fund an investment leverage strategy along with funding growth in the loan and investment portfolios.

As of September 30, 2021, PSB had assets of 275.5 million primarily consisting of mortgage-backed and investment securities. We may consider the establishment of one or more additional subsidiaries in the future. Employees and Human Capital Resources At September 30, 2021, we had 88 full-time employees, and two part-time employees. None of such employees are represented by a collective bargaining group, and we believe that the Company s relationship with its employees is good. We believe our ability to attract and retain employees is a key to the Bank s success. Our human capital objectives include attracting, developing, and retaining the best available talent from a diverse pool of candidates for the Bank. To do so, we strive to maintain competitive pay and benefits, regularly updating our compensation structure and periodically reviewing our compensation and benefits programs. Additionally, the Bank identifies opportunities and paths for the development of our staff, and we seek to, whenever possible, fill positions by promotion from within. The Company recognizes that the skills and knowledge of its employees are critical to the success of the organization, and promotes training and continuing education as an ongoing function for employees. We recognize the importance of our employee s financial health and well-being, and offer benefits such as a 401(k) retirement savings plan and make both matching and profit-sharing contributions to that plan, which also includes the Company s stock as an investment option. Benefit programs available to eligible employees include, besides the 401(k) retirement savings plan, health and life insurance, employee paid holidays and other benefits. We value and promote diversity and inclusion in every aspect of our business and at every level within the company.

 (the FDIC ), and is also subject to certain requirements established by the Federal Reserve Board. The federal and state laws and regulations which are applicable to banks regulate, among other things, the scope of their business, their investments, their reserves against deposits, the payment of dividends, the timing of the availability of deposited funds and the nature and amount of and collateral for certain loans. There are periodic examinations by the Department and the FDIC to test the Bank s compliance with various regulatory requirements. This regulation and supervision establishes a comprehensive framework of activities in which an institution can engage and is intended primarily for the protection of the insurance fund and depositors. The regulatory structure also gives the regulatory authorities extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities and examination policies, including policies with respect to the classification of assets and the establishment of adequate loan loss reserves for regulatory purposes. Any change in such regulation, whether by the Department, the FDIC, the Federal Reserve Board or the Congress could have a material adverse impact on Prudential Bancorp and the Bank and their respective operations. Federal law provides the federal banking regulators, including the FDIC and the Federal Reserve Board, with substantial enforcement powers. This enforcement authority includes, among other things, the ability to assess civil money penalties, to issue cease-and-desist or removal orders, and to initiate injunctive actions against banking organizations and institution-affiliated parties, as defined. In general, these enforcement actions may be initiated for violations of laws and regulations and unsafe or unsound practices. Other actions or inactions may provide the basis for enforcement action, including misleading or untimely reports filed with regulatory authorities. Prudential Bancorp is a registered as bank holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act and is subject to regulation and supervision by the Federal Reserve Board and by the Department. Prudential Bancorp files annually a report of its operations with, and is subject to examination by, the Federal Reserve Board and the Department. This regulation and oversight is generally intended to ensure that Prudential Bancorp limits its activities to those allowed by law and that it operates in a safe and sound manner without endangering the financial health of the Bank. The common stock of Prudential Bancorp is registered with the SEC under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Prudential Bancorp is subject to the proxy and tender offer rules, insider trading reporting requirements and restrictions, and certain other requirements under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Prudential Bancorp s common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Global Market under the symbol PBIP. The Nasdaq Stock Market listing requirements impose additional requirements on us, including, among other things, rules relating to corporate governance and the composition and independence of our Board of Directors and various committees of the Board, such as the audit committee. Certain of the regulatory requirements that are applicable to the Bank and Prudential Bancorp are described below. This description of statutes and regulations is not intended to be a complete explanation of such statutes and regulations and their effects on the Bank and Prudential Bancorp and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the actual statutes and regulations. 2018 Regulatory Reform In May 2018 the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act (the 2018 Act ), was enacted to modify or remove certain financial reform rules and regulations, including some of those implemented under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act Dodd-Frank Act ). While the 2018 Act maintains most of the regulatory structure established by the Dodd-Frank Act, it amends certain aspects of the regulatory framework for small depository institutions with assets of less than 10 billion and for large banks with assets of more than 50 billion. Many of these changes could result in meaningful regulatory relief for community banks such as the Bank. The 2018 Act, among other matters, expands the definition of qualified mortgages which may be held by a financial institution and simplifies the regulatory capital rules for financial institutions and their holding companies with total consolidated assets of less than 10 billion by instructing the federal banking regulators to establish a single Community Bank Leverage Ratio of between 8 and 10 percent to replace the leverage and risk-based regulatory capital ratios. The Act also expands the category of holding companies that may rely on the Small Bank Holding Company and Savings and Loan Holding Company Policy Statement (the SBHC Policy by raising the maximum amount of assets a qualifying holding company may have from 1 billion to 3 billion. This expansion also excludes such holding companies from the minimum capital requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act. In addition, the 2018 Act includes regulatory relief for 
 24 

Table of Contents 
 community banks regarding regulatory examination cycles, call reports, the Volcker Rule (proprietary trading prohibitions), mortgage disclosures and risk weights for certain high-risk commercial real estate loans. It is difficult at this time to predict how the new standards under the 2018 Act will ultimately affect the Bank or what specific impact the 2018 Act and the recently promulgated implementing rules and regulations will have on community banks. 2010 Regulatory Reform On July 21, 2010, the President signed the Dodd-Frank Act into law. The Dodd-Frank Act imposes new restrictions and an expanded framework of regulatory oversight for financial institutions, including depository institutions. The law also established an independent federal consumer protection bureau within the Federal Reserve Board. The following discussion summarizes significant aspects of the law that may affect the Bank and Prudential Bancorp. The following aspects of the financial reform and consumer protection act are related to the operations of the Bank: A new independent consumer financial protection bureau was established, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau CFPB within the Federal Reserve Board, empowered to exercise broad regulatory, supervisory and enforcement authority with respect to both new and existing consumer financial protection laws. Smaller financial institutions, like the Bank, are subject to the supervision and enforcement of their primary federal banking regulator with respect to the federal consumer financial protection laws. Tier 1 capital treatment for hybrid capital items like trust preferred securities was eliminated subject to various grandfathering and transition rules. The prohibition on payment of interest on demand deposits was repealed. Deposit insurance on most accounts increased to 250,000. The deposit insurance assessment base calculation now equals the depository institution s total assets minus the sum of its average tangible equity during the assessment period. The minimum reserve ratio of the Deposit Insurance Fund increased to 1.35 percent of estimated annual insured deposits or assessment base; however, the FDIC is directed to offset the effect of the increased reserve ratio for insured depository institutions with total consolidated assets of less than 10 billion. 
 The following aspects of the financial reform and consumer protection act are related to the operations of Prudential Bancorp: The Federal Deposit Insurance Act was amended to direct federal regulators to require depository institution holding companies to serve as a source of strength for their depository institution subsidiaries. The SEC is authorized to adopt rules requiring public companies to make their proxy materials available to shareholders for nomination of their own candidates for election to the board of directors. Public companies are now required to provide their shareholders with a non-binding vote: (i) at least once every three years on the compensation paid to executive officers, and (ii) at least once every six years on whether they should have a say on pay vote every one, two or three years. A separate, non-binding shareholder vote is now required regarding golden parachutes for named executive officers when a shareholder vote takes place on mergers, acquisitions, dispositions or other transactions that would trigger the parachute payments. 
 25

 Securities exchanges are now required to prohibit brokers from using their own discretion to vote shares not beneficially owned by them for certain significant matters, which include votes on the election of directors and executive compensation matters. Stock exchanges are prohibited from listing the securities of any issuer that does not have a policy providing for (i) disclosure of its policy on incentive compensation payable on the basis of financial information reportable under the securities laws, and (ii) the recovery from current or former executive officers, following an accounting restatement triggered by material noncompliance with securities law reporting requirements, of any incentive compensation paid erroneously during the three-year period preceding the date on which the restatement was required that exceeds the amount that would have been paid on the basis of the restated financial information. Disclosure in annual proxy materials will be required concerning the relationship between the executive compensation paid and the financial performance of the issuer. Item 402 of Regulation S-K promulgated by the SEC will be amended to require companies (other than smaller reporting companies and emerging growth companies) to disclose the ratio of the Chief Executive Officer s annual total compensation to the median annual total compensation of all other employees. Smaller reporting companies are exempt from complying with the internal control auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. 
 Regulation of Prudential Bank Pennsylvania Banking Law. The Pennsylvania Banking Code of 1965 (the Banking Code contains detailed provisions governing the organization, location of offices, rights and responsibilities of directors, officers, employees and members, as well as corporate powers, savings and investment operations and other aspects of the Bank and its affairs. The Banking Code delegates extensive rulemaking power and administrative discretion to the Department so that the supervision and regulation of state-chartered savings banks may be flexible and readily responsive to changes in economic conditions and in savings and lending practices. One of the purposes of the Banking Code is to provide savings banks with the opportunity to be competitive with each other and with other financial institutions existing under other Pennsylvania laws and other state, federal and foreign laws. A Pennsylvania savings bank may locate or change the location of its principal place of business and establish an office anywhere in Pennsylvania, with the prior approval of the Department. The Department generally examines each savings bank not less frequently than once every two years. Although the Department may accept the examinations and reports of the FDIC in lieu of its own examination, the present practice is for the Department to alternate conducting examinations with the FDIC. The Department may order any savings bank to discontinue any violation of law or unsafe or unsound business practice and may direct any director, trustee, officer, attorney or employee of a savings bank engaged in an objectionable activity, after the Department has ordered the activity to be terminated, to show cause at a hearing before the Department why such person should not be removed. Insurance of Accounts . The deposits of the Bank are insured to the maximum extent permitted by the Deposit Insurance Fund and are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. Government. The Dodd-Frank Act increased deposit insurance on most accounts to 250,000. As insurer, the FDIC is authorized to conduct examinations of, and to require reporting by, insured institutions. It also may prohibit any insured institution from engaging in any activity determined by regulation or order to pose a serious threat to the FDIC. The FDIC also has the authority to initiate enforcement actions against savings institutions. The Dodd Frank Act raises the minimum reserve ratio of the Deposit Insurance Fund from 1.15 to 1.35 and requires the FDIC to offset the effect of this increase on insured institutions with assets of less than 10 billion (small institutions). In March 2017, the FDIC adopted a rule to accomplish this by imposing a surcharge on larger institutions commencing when the reserve ratio reaches 1.15 and ending when it reaches 1.35 . The reserve ratio reached 1.15 
 26 

Table of Contents 
 effective as of June 30, 2017. This surcharge period became effective July 1, 2017 and ended on September 30, 2019 when the reserve ratio reached 1.36 . Small institutions will receive credits for the portion of their regular assessments that contributed to growth in the reserve ratio between 1.15 and 1.35 . The credits will apply to reduce regular assessments by 2.0 basis points for quarters when the reserve ratio is at least 1.38 . As of June 30, 2019 the reserve ratio reached 1.40 and small bank assessment credits were applied to FDIC insurance invoices. The Bank received a credit of 216,000. In 2020, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation announced that all credits had been remitted and that the credit program had ended. Effective July 1, 2016 the FDIC adopted changes that eliminated its risk-based premium system. The FDIC assesses deposit insurance premiums on the assessment base of a depository institution, which is their average total asset reduced by the amount of its average tangible equity. For a small institution (one with assets of less than 10 billion) that has been federally insured for at least five years, effective July 1, 2016, the initial base assessment rate ranges from 3 to 30 basis points, based on the institution s CAMELS composite and component ratings and certain financial ratios: its leverage ratio; its ratio of net income before taxes to total assets; its ratio of nonperforming loans and leases to gross assets; its ratio of other real estate owned to gross assets; its brokered deposits ratio (excluding reciprocal deposits if the institution is well capitalized and has a CAMELS composite rating of 1 or 2); its one year asset growth ratio (which penalizes growth adjusted for mergers in excess of 10 ); and its loan mix index (which penalizes higher risk loans based on historical industry charge off rates). The initial base assessment rate is subject to downward adjustment (not below 1.5 based on the ratio of unsecured debt the institution has issued to its assessment base, and to upward adjustment (which can cause the rate to exceed 30 basis points) based on its holdings of unsecured debt issued by other insured institutions. Institutions with assets of 10 billion or more are assessed using a scorecard method. The FDIC may terminate the deposit insurance of any insured depository institution, including the Bank, if it determines after a hearing that the institution has engaged or is engaging in unsafe or unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations, or has violated any applicable law, regulation, order or any condition imposed by an agreement with the FDIC. It also may suspend deposit insurance temporarily during the hearing process for the permanent termination of insurance, if the institution has no tangible capital. If insurance of accounts is terminated, the accounts at the institution at the time of the termination, less subsequent withdrawals, shall continue to be insured for a period of six months to two years, as determined by the FDIC. Management is not aware of any existing circumstances which could result in termination of the Bank s deposit insurance. Regulatory Capital Requirements. Unless a community bank qualifies and elects to comply with the community bank leverage ratio (the CBLR requirement described below, federal regulations require Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation-insured depository institutions to meet several minimum capital standards: a common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets ratio of 4.5 , a Tier 1capital to risk-based assets of 6.0 , a total capital to risk-based assets ratio of 8.0 and a Tier 1 capital to average assets leverage ratio of 4.0 . In addition, in order to make capital distributions and pay discretionary bonuses to executive officers without restriction, an institution must also maintain greater than 2.5 in common equity attributable to a capital conservation buffer. Effective January 1, 2020, qualifying community banking organizations may elect to comply with a greater than 9 community bank leverage ratio (the CBLR requirement in lieu of the currently applicable requirements for calculating and reporting risk-based capital ratios. The CBLR is equal to Tier 1 capital divided by average total consolidated assets. In order to qualify for the CBLR election, a community bank must (i) have a leverage capital ratio greater than 9 percent, (2) have less than 10 billion in average total consolidated assets, (3) not exceed certain levels of off-balance sheet exposure and trading assets plus trading liabilities and (4) not be an advanced approaches banking organization. A community bank that meets the above qualifications and elects to utilize the CBLR is considered to have satisfied the risk-based and leverage capital requirements in the generally applicable capital rules and is also considered to be well capitalized under the prompt corrective action rules. As of September 30, 2021, the Bank had not elected to be subject to the CBLR requirement. The common equity Tier 1 capital component generally consists of retained earnings and common stock instruments. Tier 1 capital is generally defined as common equity Tier 1 and additional Tier 1 capital. Additional Tier 1 capital includes certain noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and related surplus and minority interests in equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries. Under the risk-based capital requirement, total capital (a combination of core and 
 27 

Table of Contents 
 supplementary capital). The FDIC also is authorized to impose capital requirements in excess of these standards on individual institutions on a case-by-case basis. In determining compliance with the risk-based capital requirement, a savings bank is allowed to include both core capital and supplementary capital in its total capital, provided that the amount of supplementary capital included does not exceed the savings bank s core capital. Supplementary capital generally consists of general allowances for loan losses up to a maximum of 1.25 of risk-weighted assets, together with certain other items. In determining the required amount of risk-based capital, total assets, including certain off-balance sheet items, are multiplied by a risk weight based on the risks inherent in the type of assets. The risk weights range from 0 for cash and securities issued by the U.S. Government or unconditionally backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. Government to 100 for loans (other than qualifying residential loans weighted at 80 and repossessed assets and to 150 for certain acquisition, development and construction loans and more than 90-day past due exposures. Savings banks must value securities available for sale at amortized cost for regulatory capital purposes. This means that in computing regulatory capital, savings banks should add back any unrealized losses and deduct any unrealized gains, net of income taxes, on debt securities reported as a separate component of capital, as defined by generally accepted accounting principles. At September 30, 2021, the Bank exceeded all of its regulatory capital requirements, with Tier 1, Tier 1 common equity, Tier 1 (to risk-weighted assets) and total risk-based capital ratios of 11.30 , 16.37 , 16.37 and 17.55 , respectively. Any savings bank that fails any of the capital requirements is subject to possible enforcement action by the FDIC. Such action could include a capital directive, a cease and desist order, civil money penalties, the establishment of restrictions on the institution s operations, termination of federal deposit insurance and the appointment of a conservator or receiver. The FDIC s capital regulations provide that such actions, through enforcement proceedings or otherwise, could require one or more of a variety of corrective actions. Department Capital Requirements . The Bank is also subject to more stringent Department capital guidelines. Although not adopted in regulation form, the Department utilizes capital standards requiring a minimum of 6 leverage capital and 10 risk-based capital. The components of leverage and risk-based capital are substantially the same as those defined by the FDIC. At September 30, 2021, the Bank s capital ratios exceeded each of its capital requirements. Prompt Corrective Acti on. The following table shows the amount of capital associated with the different capital categories set forth in the prompt corrective action regulations (and does not take into account the potential determination to elect to use the CBLR). 

Total Tier 1 Tier 1 Tier 1 Risk-Based Risk-Based Common Equity Leverage Capital Category Capital Capital Capital Capital Well capitalized 10 or more 8 or more 6.5 or more 5 or more Adequately capitalized 8 or more 6 or more 4.5 or more 4 or more Undercapitalized Less than 8 Less than 6 Less than 4.5 Less than 4 Significantly undercapitalized Less than 6 Less than 4 Less than 3 Less than 3 In addition, an institution is critically undercapitalized if it has a ratio of tangible equity to total assets that is equal to or less than 2.0 . Under specified circumstances, a federal banking agency may reclassify a well capitalized institution as adequately capitalized and may require an adequately capitalized institution or an undercapitalized institution to comply with supervisory actions as if it were in the next lower category (except that the FDIC may not reclassify a significantly undercapitalized institution as critically undercapitalized). An institution generally must file a written capital restoration plan which meets specified requirements within 45 days of the date that the institution receives notice or is deemed to have notice that it is undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized or critically undercapitalized. A federal banking agency must provide the institution with written notice 
 28 

Table of Contents 
 of approval or disapproval within 60 days after receiving a capital restoration plan, subject to extensions by the agency. An institution which is required to submit a capital restoration plan must concurrently submit a performance guaranty by each company that controls the institution. In addition, undercapitalized institutions are subject to various regulatory restrictions, and the appropriate federal banking agency also may take any number of discretionary supervisory actions. At September 30, 2021, the Bank was deemed to be a well capitalized institution for purposes of the prompt corrective action regulations and as such is not subject to the above mentioned restrictions. Summary of Capital Positions . The table below sets forth the Company and the Bank s capital position relative to its respective regulatory capital requirements at September 30, 2021. 

To Be Well Capitalized Under Prompt Required for Capital Corrective Adequacy Action Ratio Purposes (1) Provisions (1) September 30, 2021: Tier 1 capital (to average assets) Company 11.48 N/A N/A Bank 11.30 4.0 5.0 Tier 1 Common (to risk-weighted assets) Company 16.70 N/A N/A Bank 16.37 4.5 6.5 Tier 1 capital (to risk-weighted assets) Company 16.70 N/A N/A Bank 16.37 6.0 8.0 Total capital (to risk-weighted assets) Company 17.87 N/A N/A Bank 17.55 8.0 10.0 September 30, 2020: Tier 1 capital (to average assets) Company 10.34 N/A N/A Bank 10.51 4.0 5.0 Tier 1 Common (to risk-weighted assets) Company 17.21 N/A N/A Bank 16.88 4.5 6.5 Tier 1 capital (to risk-weighted assets) Company 17.21 N/A N/A Bank 16.88 6.0 8.0 Total capital (to risk-weighted assets) Company 18.41 N/A N/A Bank 18.08 8.0 10.0 

 (1) The Company is not subject to the regulatory capital ratios imposed by Basel III on bank holding companies because the Company was deemed to be a small bank holding company as of September 30, 2021. 
 Activities and Investments of Insured State-Chartered Banks and Savings Banks. The activities and equity investments of FDIC-insured, state-chartered banks and savings banks are generally limited to those that are permissible for national banks or a federal savings association. Under regulations dealing with equity investments, an insured state bank or savings bank generally may not directly or indirectly acquire or retain any equity investment of a type, or in an amount, that is not permissible for a national bank or a federal savings association. An insured state bank is not prohibited from, among other things: acquiring or retaining a majority interest in a subsidiary; 
 29 

Table of Contents 
 investing as a limited partner in a partnership the sole purpose of which is direct or indirect investment in the acquisition, rehabilitation or new construction of a qualified housing project, provided that such limited partnership investments may not exceed 2 of the bank s total assets; acquiring up to 10 of the voting stock of a company that solely provides or reinsures directors , trustees and officers liability insurance coverage or bankers blanket bond group insurance coverage for insured depository institutions; and acquiring or retaining the voting shares of a depository institution if certain requirements are met. 
 The FDIC has adopted regulations pertaining to the other activity restrictions imposed upon insured state-chartered banks and savings banks and their subsidiaries. Pursuant to such regulations, insured state banks and savings banks engaging in impermissible activities may seek approval from the FDIC to continue such activities. State banks and savings banks not engaging in such activities but that desire to engage in otherwise impermissible activities either directly or through a subsidiary may apply for approval from the FDIC to do so; however, if such bank fails to meet the minimum capital requirements or the activities present a significant risk to the FDIC insurance funds, such application will not be approved by the FDIC. Pursuant to this authority, the FDIC has determined that investments in certain majority-owned subsidiaries of insured state-chartered banks and savings banks do not represent a significant risk to the deposit insurance funds. Investments permitted under that authority include real estate activities and securities activities. Restrictions on Capital Distributions . Under federal rules, an insured depository institution may not pay any dividend if payment would cause it to become undercapitalized or if it is already undercapitalized. In addition, federal regulators have the authority to restrict or prohibit the payment of dividends for safety and soundness reasons. The FDIC also prohibits an insured depository institution from paying dividends on its capital stock or interest on its capital notes or debentures (if such interest is required to be paid only out of net profits) or distributing any of its capital assets while it remains in default in the payment of any assessment due the FDIC. The Bank is currently not in default in any assessment payment to the FDIC. Pennsylvania law also restricts the payment and amount of dividends, including the requirement that dividends be paid only out of accumulated net earnings. Incentive Compensation . Guidelines adopted by the federal banking agencies pursuant to the FDIA prohibit excessive compensation as an unsafe and unsound practice and describe compensation as excessive when the amounts paid are unreasonable or disproportionate to the services performed by an executive officer, employee, director or principal stockholder. In January 2010, the FDIC announced that it would seek public comment on whether banks with compensation plans that encourage risky behavior should be charged higher deposit assessment rates than such banks would otherwise be charged. The comment period ended in February 2010. As of September 30, 2021, a final rule has not been adopted. In June 2010, the federal banking agencies issued comprehensive guidance on incentive compensation policies (the Incentive Compensation Guidance intended to ensure that the incentive compensation policies of banking organizations do not undermine the safety and soundness of such organizations by encouraging excessive risk-taking. The Incentive Compensation Guidance, which covers all employees that have the ability to materially affect the risk profile of an organization, either individually or as part of a group, is based upon the key principles that a banking organization s incentive compensation arrangements should (i) provide incentives that do not encourage risk-taking beyond the organization s ability to effectively identify and manage risks, (ii) be compatible with effective internal controls and risk management, and (iii) be supported by strong corporate governance, including active and effective oversight by the organization s board of directors. Any deficiencies in compensation practices that are identified may be incorporated into the organization s supervisory ratings, which can affect its ability to make acquisitions or perform other actions. The Incentive Compensation Guidance provides that enforcement actions may be taken against a banking organization if its incentive compensation arrangements or related risk-management control or governance processes pose a risk to the organization s safety and soundness and the organization is not taking prompt and effective measures to correct the deficiencies.

Table of Contents 
 In April 2011, the federal banking agencies and the SEC jointly published proposed rulemaking designed to implement provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act prohibiting incentive compensation arrangements that would encourage inappropriate risk taking. Those proposed regulations apply only to a financial institution or its holding company with 1 billion or more of assets. In June 2016, the federal banking agencies and the SEC published a new proposed rule to implement these provisions. The scope and content of the U.S. banking regulators policies on incentive compensation are continuing to develop. It cannot be determined at this time whether a final rule will be adopted and whether compliance with such a final rule will adversely affect the ability of Prudential Bancorp and the Bank to hire, retain and motivate their key employees. Privacy Requirements. Federal law places limitations on financial institutions like the Bank regarding the sharing of consumer financial information with unaffiliated third parties. Specifically, these provisions require all financial institutions offering financial products or services to retail customers to provide such customers with the financial institution s privacy policy and provide such customers the opportunity to opt out of the sharing of personal financial information with unaffiliated third parties. The Bank currently has a privacy protection policy in place and believes such policy is in compliance with applicable regulations. Anti-Money Laundering . Federal anti-money laundering rules impose various requirements on financial institutions to prevent the use of the U.S. financial system to fund terrorist activities. These provisions include a requirement that financial institutions operating in the United States have anti-money laundering compliance programs, due diligence policies and controls to ensure the detection and reporting of money laundering. Such compliance programs supplement existing compliance requirements, also applicable to financial institutions, under the Bank Secrecy Act and the Office of Foreign Assets Control Regulations. The Bank has established policies and procedures to ensure compliance with the federal anti-money laundering provisions. UDAP and UDAAP . Recently, banking regulatory agencies have increasingly used a general consumer protection statute to address unethical or otherwise bad business practices that may not necessarily fall directly under the purview of a specific banking or consumer finance law. The law of choice for enforcement against such business practices has been Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act (the FTC Act ), which is the primary federal law that prohibits unfair or deceptive acts or practices, referred to as UDAP, and unfair methods of competition in or affecting commerce. Unjustified consumer injury is the principal focus of the FTC Act. Prior to the Dodd- Frank Act, there was little formal guidance to provide insight to the parameters for compliance with UDAP laws and regulations. However, UDAP laws and regulations have been expanded under the Dodd-Frank Act to apply to unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices, referred to as UDAAP, which have been delegated to the CFPB for supervision. The CFPB has published its first Supervision and Examination Manual that addresses compliance with and the examination of UDAAP. The potential reach of the CFPB s broad new rulemaking powers and UDAAP authority on the operations of financial institutions offering consumer financial products or services, including the Bank is currently unknown. Community Reinvestment Act. All insured depository institutions have a responsibility under the Community Reinvestment Act and related regulations to help meet the credit needs of their communities, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods. An institution s failure to comply with the provisions of the Community Reinvestment Act could result in restrictions on its activities. The Bank received a satisfactory Community Reinvestment Act rating in its most recently completed examination. Consumer Protection and Fair Lending Regulations. Pennsylvania-chartered savings banks are subject to a variety of federal statutes and regulations that are intended to protect consumers and prohibit discrimination in the granting of credit. These statutes and regulations provide for a range of sanctions for non-compliance with their terms, including the imposition of administrative fines and remedial orders, and referral to the Attorney General for prosecution of a civil action for actual and punitive damages and injunctive relief. Certain of these statutes authorize private individual and class action lawsuits and the award of actual, statutory and punitive damages and attorneys fees for certain types of violations.

 USA PATRIOT Act . The Bank is subject to the USA PATRIOT Act, which gave federal agencies additional powers to address terrorist threats through enhanced domestic security measures, expanded surveillance powers, increased information sharing, and broadened anti-money laundering requirements. By way of amendments to the Bank Secrecy Act, Title III of the USA PATRIOT Act provided measures intended to encourage information sharing among bank regulatory agencies and law enforcement bodies. Further, certain provisions of Title III impose affirmative obligations on a broad range of financial institutions, including banks, thrifts, brokers, dealers, credit unions, money transfer agents, and parties registered under the Commodity Exchange Act. Other Regulations. Interest and other charges collected or contracted for by the Bank are subject to state usury laws and federal laws concerning interest rates. Loan operations are also subject to state and federal laws applicable to credit transactions, such as the: Home Mortgage Disclosure Act of 1975, requiring financial institutions to provide information to enable the public and public officials to determine whether a financial institution is fulfilling its obligation to help meet the housing needs of the community it serves; Equal Credit Opportunity Act, prohibiting discrimination on the basis of race, creed or other prohibited factors in extending credit; Fair Credit Reporting Act of 1978, governing the use and provision of information to credit reporting agencies; and Rules and regulations of the various federal and state agencies charged with the responsibility of implementing such federal and state laws. 
 The deposit operations of the Bank also are subject to, among others, the: Right to Financial Privacy Act, which imposes a duty to maintain the confidentiality of consumer financial records and prescribes procedures for complying with administrative subpoenas of financial records; Check Clearing for the 21st Century Act (also known as Check 21 ), which gives substitute checks, such as digital check images and copies made from that image, the same legal standing as the original paper check; and Electronic Funds Transfer Act and Regulation E promulgated thereunder, which govern automatic deposits to and withdrawals from deposit accounts and customers rights and liabilities arising from the use of automated teller machines and other electronic banking services. 
 Federal Home Loan Bank System . The Bank is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh, which is one of 11 regional Federal Home Loan Banks. Each Federal Home Loan Bank serves as a reserve or central bank for its members within its assigned region. It is funded primarily from proceeds from the sale of consolidated obligations of the Federal Home Loan Bank System. It makes loans to members (i.e., advances) in accordance with policies and procedures established by the board of directors of the Federal Home Loan Bank. As a member, the Bank is required to purchase and maintain stock in the Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh in an amount in accordance with the Federal Home Loan Bank s capital plan and sufficient to ensure that the Federal Home Loan Bank remains in compliance with its minimum capital requirements. At September 30, 2021, the Bank was in compliance with this requirement. Federal Reserve Board . The Federal Reserve Board requires all depository institutions to maintain non-interest bearing reserves at specified levels against their transaction accounts, which are primarily checking and NOW accounts, and non-personal time deposits. The balances maintained to meet the reserve requirements imposed by the Federal Reserve Board may be used to satisfy the liquidity requirements that are imposed by the Department. At September 30, 2021, the 
 32

 Bank was in compliance with these reserve requirements. On March 15, 2020, the Federal Reserve Board reduced reserve requirement to 0 effective as of March 26, 2020, which eliminated reserve requirements for all depository institutions. Regulation of Prudential Bancorp Bank Holding Company Act Activities and Other Limitations. Under the Bank Holding Company Act, Prudential Bancorp must obtain the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board before it may acquire control of another bank or bank holding company, merge or consolidate with another bank holding company, acquire all or substantially all of the assets of another bank or bank holding company, or acquire direct or indirect ownership or control of any voting shares of any bank or bank holding company if, after such acquisition, Prudential Bancorp would directly or indirectly own or control more than 5 of such shares. Federal statutes impose restrictions on the ability of a bank holding company and its nonbank subsidiaries to obtain extensions of credit from its subsidiary bank, on the subsidiary bank s investments in the stock or securities of the holding company, and on the subsidiary bank s taking of the holding company s stock or securities as collateral for loans to any borrower. A bank holding company and its subsidiaries are also prevented from engaging in certain tie-in arrangements in connection with any extension of credit, lease or sale of property, or furnishing of services by the subsidiary bank. A bank holding company is required to serve as a source of financial and managerial strength to its subsidiary banks and may not conduct its operations in an unsafe or unsound manner. In addition, it has been the policy of the Federal Reserve Board that a bank holding company should stand ready to use available resources to provide adequate capital to its subsidiary banks during periods of financial stress or adversity and should maintain the financial flexibility and capital-raising capacity to obtain additional resources for assisting its subsidiary banks. A bank holding company s failure to meet its obligations to serve as a source of strength to its subsidiary banks will generally be considered by the Federal Reserve Board to be an unsafe and unsound banking practice or a violation of the Federal Reserve Board regulations, or both. The Dodd-Frank Act included a provision that directs federal regulators to require depository institution holding companies to serve as a source of strength for their depository institution subsidiaries. To date, no regulations have been promulgated to implement that provision. Non-Banking Activities. The business activities of Prudential Bancorp, as a bank holding company, are restricted by the Bank Holding Company Act. Under the Bank Holding Company Act and the Federal Reserve Board s bank holding company regulations, bank holding companies may only engage in, or acquire or control voting securities or assets of a company engaged in: banking or managing or controlling banks and other subsidiaries authorized under the Bank Holding Company Act; and any Bank Holding Company Act activity the Federal Reserve Board has determined to be so closely related that it is incidental to banking or managing or controlling banks. 
 The Federal Reserve Board has determined by regulation that certain activities are closely related to banking including operating a mortgage company, finance company, credit card company, factoring company, trust company or savings association; performing certain data processing operations; providing limited securities brokerage services; acting as an investment or financial advisor; acting as an insurance agent for certain types of credit-related insurance; leasing personal property on a full-payout, non-operating basis; providing tax planning and preparation services; operating a collection agency; and providing certain courier services. Moreover, as discussed below, certain other activities are permissible for a bank holding company that becomes a financial holding company. Financial Holding Companies. Bank holding companies may also engage in a broad range of activities under a type of financial services company known as a financial holding company. A financial holding company essentially is a bank holding company with significantly expanded powers. Financial holding companies are authorized by statute to engage in a number of financial activities previously impermissible for bank holding companies, including securities 
 33 

Table of Contents 
 underwriting, dealing and market making; sponsoring mutual funds and investment companies; insurance underwriting and agency; and merchant banking activities. The Federal Reserve Board and the Department of the Treasury are also authorized to permit additional activities for financial holding companies if the activities are financial in nature or incidental to financial activities. A bank holding company may become a financial holding company if each of its subsidiary banks is well capitalized, well managed, and has at least a satisfactory Community Reinvestment Act rating. A financial holding company must provide notice to the Federal Reserve Board within 30 days after commencing activities previously determined by statute or by the Federal Reserve Board and Department of the Treasury to be permissible. Prudential Bancorp has not submitted notices to the Federal Reserve Board of its intent to be deemed a financial holding company. However, it is not precluded from submitting a notice in the future should it wish to engage in activities only permitted to financial holding companies. Regulatory Capital Requirements . The Federal Reserve Board has adopted capital adequacy guidelines pursuant to which it assesses the adequacy of capital in examining and supervising a bank holding company and in analyzing applications to it under the Bank Holding Company Act. The Federal Reserve Board s capital adequacy guidelines for bank holding company, on a consolidated basis, are similar to those imposed on the Bank by the FDIC. See -Regulation of Prudential Bank - Capital Requirements. Moreover, certain of the bank holding company capital requirements promulgated by the Federal Reserve Board in 2013 became effective as of January 1, 2017. Those requirements establish four minimum capital ratios that Prudential Bancorp had to comply with as of that date as set forth in the table below. However, in May 2016, amendments to the Federal Reserve Board s SBHC Policy became effective which increased the asset threshold to qualify to utilize the provisions of the SBHC Policy from 500 million to 1.0 billion. Subsequently, as part of the 2018 Act, the threshold was increased to 3.0 billion. Bank holding companies which are subject to the SBHC Policy are not subject to compliance with the regulatory capital requirements set forth in the table below until they exceed 3.0 billion in assets. As a consequence, as of September 30, 2021, Prudential Bancorp was not required to comply with the requirements set forth below until such time that its consolidated total assets exceed 3.0 billion or the Federal Reserve Board determines that Prudential Bancorp is no longer deemed to be a small bank holding company. However, if Prudential Bancorp had been subject to the requirements, it would have been in compliance with such requirements. 

Capital Ratio Regulatory Minimum Common Equity Tier 1 Capital 4.5 Tier 1 Leverage Capital 4.0 Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital 6.0 Total Risk-Based Capital 8.0 The leverage capital requirement is calculated as a percentage of total assets and the other three capital requirements are calculated as a percentage of risk-weighted assets. For a more detailed discussion of the 2013 capital rules, see Recent Regulatory Capital Regulations under Regulation of Prudential Bank above. Restrictions on Dividends and Repurchases . Prudential Bancorp s ability to declare and pay dividends may depend in part on dividends received from the Bank. The Banking Code regulates the distribution of dividends by savings banks and states, in part, that dividends may be declared and paid out of accumulated net earnings, provided that the bank continues to meet its surplus requirements. In addition, dividends may not be declared or paid if the Bank is in default in payment of any assessment due the FDIC. A Federal Reserve Board policy statement on the payment of cash dividends states that a bank holding company should pay cash dividends only to the extent that the holding company s net income for the past year is sufficient to cover both the cash dividends and a rate of earnings retention that is consistent with the holding company s capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. The Federal Reserve Board s policy statement also provides that it would be inappropriate for a company experiencing serious financial problems to borrow funds to pay dividends. Furthermore, under the federal prompt corrective action regulations, the Federal Reserve Board may prohibit a bank holding company from paying any dividends if the holding company s bank subsidiary is classified as undercapitalized. See -Regulation of Prudential Bank - Prompt Corrective Action above. Section 225.4(b)(1) of Regulation Y promulgated by the Federal Reserve Board requires that a bank holding company that is not well capitalized or well managed, or that is subject to any unresolved supervisory issues, provide prior 
 34 

Table of Contents 
 notice to the Federal Reserve Board for any repurchase or redemption of its equity securities for cash or other value that would reduce by 10 percent or more the bank holding company s consolidated net worth aggregated over the preceding 12-month period. The Federal Reserve Bank may disapprove such a purchase or redemption if it determines that the proposal would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice or would violate any law, regulation, Federal Reserve Board order or any condition imposed by, or written agreement with, the Federal Reserve Board. Federal Securities Laws . Prudential Bancorp s common stock is registered with the SEC under Section 12(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Prudential Bancorp is subject to the proxy and tender offer rules, insider trading reporting requirements and restrictions, and certain other requirements under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act . As a public company, Prudential Bancorp is subject to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 which addresses, among other issues, corporate governance, auditing and accounting, executive compensation, and enhanced and timely disclosure of corporate information. As directed by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer are required to certify that our quarterly and annual reports do not contain any untrue statement of a material fact. The rules adopted by the SEC under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act have several requirements, including having these officers certify that: they are responsible for establishing, maintaining and regularly evaluating the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting; they have made certain disclosures to our auditors and the audit committee of the Board of Directors about our internal control over financial reporting; and they have included information in our quarterly and annual reports about their evaluation and whether there have been changes in our internal control over financial reporting or in other factors that could materially affect internal control over financial reporting. Volcker Rule Regulations . Regulations have been adopted by the federal banking agencies to implement the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act commonly referred to as the Volcker Rule. The regulations contain prohibitions and restrictions on the ability of financial institutions holding companies and their affiliates to engage in proprietary trading and to hold certain interests in, or to have certain relationships with, various types of investment funds, including hedge funds and private equity funds. Recently promulgated federal regulations exclude from the Volcker Rule restrictions community banks with 10 billion or less in total consolidated assets and total trading assets and liabilities of five percent or less of total consolidated assets. Prudential Bancorp qualifies for the exclusion from the Volcker Rule restrictions. Limitations on Transactions with Affiliates . Transactions between insured financial institutions and any affiliate are governed by Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act. An affiliate of an insured financial institution is any company or entity which controls, is controlled by or is under common control with the insured financial institution. In a bank holding company context, the bank holding company of an insured financial institution (such as Prudential Bancorp) and any companies which are controlled by such holding company are affiliates of the insured financial institution. Generally, Section 23A limits the extent to which the insured financial institution or its subsidiaries may engage in covered transactions with any one affiliate to an amount equal to 10 of such institution s capital stock and surplus, and contains an aggregate limit on all such transactions with all affiliates to an amount equal to 20 of such capital stock and surplus. Section 23B applies to covered transactions as well as certain other transactions and requires that all transactions be on terms substantially the same, or at least as favorable to the insured financial institution, as those provided to a non-affiliate. The term covered transaction includes the making of loans to, purchase of assets from and issuance of a guarantee to an affiliate and similar transactions. Section 23B transactions also include the provision of services and the sale of assets by an insured financial institution to an affiliate. In addition, Sections 22(g) and (h) of the Federal Reserve Act place restrictions on loans to executive officers, directors and principal stockholders. Under Section 22(h), loans to a director, an executive officer and to a greater than 10 stockholder of an insured financial institution, and certain affiliated interests of either, may not exceed, together with all other outstanding loans to such person and affiliated interests, the insured financial institution s loans to one borrower limit (generally equal to 15 of the institution s unimpaired capital and surplus). Section 22(h) also requires that loans to directors, executive officers and principal stockholders be made on terms substantially the same as offered in comparable transactions to other persons unless the loans are made pursuant to a benefit or compensation program that (i) is widely available to employees of the institution and (ii) does not give preference to any director, executive officer or principal stockholder, or certain affiliated interests of either, over other employees of the insured financial institution. Section 22(h) also requires prior board approval for certain loans. In addition, the aggregate amount of extensions of credit by an insured financial institution to all insiders cannot exceed the institution s unimpaired capital and surplus. Furthermore, Section 
 35 

Table of Contents 
 22(g) places additional restrictions on loans to executive officers. At September 30, 2021, the Bank was in compliance with the above restrictions. TAXATION Federal Taxation General . Prudential Bancorp and the Bank are subject to federal income taxation in the same general manner as other corporations with some exceptions listed below. The following discussion of federal, state and local income taxation is only intended to summarize certain pertinent income tax matters and is not a comprehensive description of the applicable tax rules. During fiscal 2021, the Internal Revenue Service had concluded an audit of the Company s tax returns for the year ended September 30, 2016 and no adverse findings were noted. The federal and state income tax returns for taxable years through September 30, 2016 have been closed for purposes of examination by the Internal Revenue Service and the Pennsylvania Department of Revenue. Prudential Bancorp files a consolidated federal income tax return with the Bank and its subsidiary, PSB. Any distributions made by Prudential Bancorp to its shareholders generally will be treated as cash dividends and not as a non-taxable return of capital to shareholders for federal and state tax purposes. Method of Accounting . For federal income tax purposes, Prudential Bancorp and the Bank report income and expenses on the accrual method of accounting and file their federal income tax return on a fiscal year basis. Bad Debt Reserves . The Small Business Job Protection Act of 1996 eliminated the use of the reserve method of accounting for bad debt reserves by savings associations, effective for taxable years beginning after 1995. Prior to that time, the Bank was permitted to establish a reserve for bad debts and to make additions to the reserve. These additions could, within specified formula limits, be deducted in arriving at taxable income. As a result of the Small Business Job Protection Act of 1996, savings associations must use the specific charge-off method in computing their bad debt deduction beginning with their 1996 federal tax return. In addition, federal legislation required the recapture over a six year period of the excess of tax bad debt reserves at December 31, 1995 over those established as of December 31, 1987. Taxable Distributions and Recapture . Prior to the Small Business Job Protection Act of 1996, bad debt reserves created prior to January 1, 1988 were subject to recapture into taxable income if the Bank failed to meet certain thrift asset and definitional tests. New federal legislation eliminated these savings association related recapture rules. However, under current law, pre-1988 reserves remain subject to recapture should the Bank make certain non-dividend distributions or cease to maintain a bank charter. At September 30, 2021, the total federal pre-1988 reserve was approximately 6.6 million. The reserve reflects the cumulative effects of federal tax deductions by the Bank for which no federal income tax provisions have been made. Alternative Minimum Tax . The Internal Revenue Code imposes an alternative minimum tax at a rate of 20 on a base of regular taxable income plus certain tax preferences. The alternative minimum tax is payable to the extent such alternative minimum tax income is in excess of the regular income tax. Net operating losses, of which the Bank has none, can offset no more than 90 of alternative minimum taxable income. Certain payments of alternative minimum tax may be used as credits against regular tax liabilities in future years. The Bank has not been subject to the alternative minimum tax. Corporate Dividends Received Deduction . Prudential Bancorp may exclude from its income 100 of dividends received from the Bank as a member of the same affiliated group of corporations. The corporate dividends received deduction is 80 in the case of dividends received from corporations which a corporate recipient owns less than 80 , but at least 20 of the distribution corporation. Corporations which own less than 20 of the stock of a corporation distributing a dividend may deduct only 70 of dividends received.

 State and Local Taxation Pennsylvania Taxation . Prudential Bancorp is subject to the Pennsylvania Corporate Net Income Tax and the Capital Stock and Franchise Tax. The Corporation Net Income Tax rate for 2021 is 9.99 and is imposed on unconsolidated taxable income for federal purposes with certain adjustments. In general, the Capital Stock and Franchise Tax is a property tax imposed on a corporation s capital stock value at a statutorily defined rate, such value being determined in accordance with a fixed formula based upon average net income and net worth. The Bank is subject to tax under the Pennsylvania Mutual Thrift Institutions Tax Act, as amended to include thrift institutions having capital stock. Pursuant to the Mutual Thrift Institutions Tax, the tax rate is 11.50 . The Mutual Thrift Institutions Tax exempts Prudential Savings from other taxes imposed by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania for state income tax purposes and from all local taxation imposed by political subdivisions, except taxes on real estate and real estate transfers. The Mutual Thrift Institutions Tax is a tax upon net earnings, determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles with certain adjustments. The Mutual Thrift Institutions Tax, in computing income according to generally accepted accounting principles, allows for the deduction of interest earned on state and federal obligations, while disallowing a percentage of a thrift s interest expense deduction in the proportion of interest income on those securities to the overall interest income of the Bank. Net operating losses, if any, thereafter can be carried forward three years for Mutual Thrift Institutions Tax purposes. In addition, as a savings bank conducting business in Philadelphia, the Bank is also subject to the City of Philadelphia Business Privilege Tax. The City of Philadelphia Business Privilege Tax is a tax upon net income or taxable receipts imposed on persons carrying on or exercising for gain or profit certain business activities within Philadelphia. Pursuant to the City of Philadelphia Business Privilege Tax, the 2021 tax rate was 6.20 on net income and 0.145 on gross receipts. For regulated industry taxpayers, the tax is the lesser of the tax on net income or the tax on gross receipts. The City of Philadelphia Business Privilege Tax allows for the deduction by financial businesses from receipts of (a) the cost of securities and other intangible property and monetary metals sold, exchanged, paid at maturity or redeemed, but only to the extent of the total gross receipts from securities and other intangible property and monetary metals sold, exchanged, paid out at maturity or redeemed; (b) moneys or credits received in repayment of the principal amount of deposits, advances, credits, loans and other obligations; (c) interest received on account of deposits, advances, credits, loans and other obligations made to persons resident or having their principal place of business outside Philadelphia;(d) interest received on account of other deposits, advances, credits, loans and other obligations but only to the extent of interest expenses attributable to such deposits, advances, credits, loans and other obligations; and (e) payments received on account of shares purchased by stockholders. An apportioned net operating loss may be carried forward for three tax years following the tax year for which it was first reported. Item 1A. Risk Factors In analyzing whether to make or to continue on investment in our securities, investors should consider, among other factors, the following risk factors. Risks Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic The global COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected, and will likely continue to adversely affect, our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations and the ultimate impact will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including the scope and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and the actions taken by governmental authorities in response to the pandemic. The Company believes the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic has negatively affected our business and is likely to continue to do so. The outbreak has caused significant volatility and disruption in the financial markets both in the United States and globally. In our market area, stay-at-home orders and travel restrictions, and similar orders imposed across the United States to restrict the spread of COVID-19, resulted in significant business and operational disruptions, including business closures, supply chain disruptions, and significant layoffs and furloughs. Local jurisdictions have subsequently lifted stay-at-home orders and moved to phased reopening of businesses, although capacity restrictions and health and safety recommendations that encourage continued physical distancing and working remotely have limited the ability of 
 37 

Table of Contents 
 businesses to return to pre-pandemic levels of activity. If COVID-19, or another highly infectious or contagious disease, continues to spread or the response to contain it is unsuccessful, we could continue to experience material adverse effects on our business, financial condition, liquidity, and results of operations. The extent of such effects will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including the geographic spread of the novel coronavirus, the overall severity of the disease, the duration of the outbreak, the measures that may be taken by various governmental authorities in response to the outbreak (such as continued quarantines and travel restrictions or the re-imposition of such measures) and the possible further impacts on the global economy. The Company s operations may also be disrupted if significant portions of its workforce are unable to work effectively, including because of illness, quarantines, government actions, or other restrictions in connection with the pandemic, and the Company has already temporarily limited access to certain of its branches and offices. In response to the pandemic, the Company has also offered fee waivers, payment deferrals, and other expanded assistance to small business and personal lending customers. Future governmental actions may require these and other types of customer-related responses. The continued spread of COVID-19 and the efforts to contain the virus, including stay-at-home orders and travel restrictions, could, among other things: (1) cause changes in consumer and business spending, borrowing and saving habits, which may affect the demand for loans and other products and services the Company offers, as well as the creditworthiness of potential and current borrowers; (2) cause the Company s borrowers to be unable to meet existing payment obligations, particularly those borrowers that may be disproportionately affected by business shut downs and travel restrictions, resulting in increases in loan delinquencies, problem assets, and foreclosures; (3) cause the value of collateral for loans, especially real estate, to decline in value; (4) result in the imposition of limitations on the Company s ability to foreclose on properties during the COVID-19 pandemic; (5) result in the decline in the value of the investment securities portfolio as well as the impairment of the value of investment securities; (6) reduce the availability and productivity of the Company s employees; (7) require the Company to increase its allowance for loan losses; (8) cause the Company s vendors and counterparties to be unable to meet existing obligations to the Company; (9) adversely impact the business and operations of third-party service providers that perform critical services for our business; (10) impede our ability to close mortgage loans, if appraisers and title companies are unable to perform their functions; and (11) and reduce the net worth and liquidity of loan guarantors, impairing their ability to honor commitments to us. The Company s operations substantially depend on the management skills of the Company s senior management and directors, many of whom have held officer and director positions with us for many years. The unanticipated loss or unavailability of key employees due to the COVID-19 pandemic could harm the Company s ability to operate its business or execute its business strategy. The Company may not be successful in finding and integrating suitable successors in the event of key employee loss or unavailability. Any one or a combination of the above events could have a material, adverse effect on the Company s business, financial condition, and results of operations. Risks Related To Our Lending Activities Our non-performing assets expose us to increased risk of loss. At September 30, 2021, we had total non-performing assets of 12.5 million, or 1.1 of total assets as compared to 13.0 million or 1.2 of total assets as of September 30, 2020. Our non-performing assets adversely affect our net income in various ways. We do not accrue interest income on non-accrual loans and no interest income is recognized until the loan is performing and the financial condition of the borrower supports recording interest income on a cash basis. We must reserve for probable losses, which are established through a current period charge to income in the provision for loan losses, and from time to time, write down the value of properties in our other real estate owned portfolio to reflect changing market values. Additionally, there are legal fees associated with the resolution of problem assets as well as carrying costs such as taxes, insurance and maintenance related to our other real estate owned. Further, the resolution of non-performing assets requires the active involvement of management, which can distract us from the overall supervision of operations and other income-producing activities of the Bank. Finally, if our estimate of the allowance for loan losses is inaccurate, we will have to increase the allowance accordingly. At September 30, 2021, our allowance for loan losses amounted to 8.5 million, or 1.4 of total loans and 101.6 of non-performing loans, compared to 8.3 million, or 1.4 of total loans and 63.7 of non-performing loans at September 30, 2020.

 Higher loan losses could require us to increase our allowance for loan losses through a charge to earnings When we loan money, we incur the risk that our borrowers will not repay their loans. We reserve for loan losses by establishing an allowance through a charge to earnings. The amount of this allowance is based on our assessment of loan losses inherent in our loan portfolio. The process for determining the amount of the allowance is critical to our financial results and condition. It requires subjective and complex judgments about the future, including forecasts of economic or market conditions that might impair the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans. We might underestimate the loan losses inherent in our loan portfolio and have loan losses in excess of the amount reserved. We might increase the allowance because of changing economic conditions. For example, in a rising interest rate environment, borrowers with adjustable-rate loans could see their payments increase. There may be a significant increase in the number of borrowers who are unable or unwilling to pay their loans, resulting in our charging off more loans and increasing our allowance. In addition, when real estate values decline, the potential severity of loss on a real estate-secured loan can increase significantly, especially in the case of loans with high combined loan-to-value ratios. Weakness in the national economy and the economies of the areas in which our loans are concentrated could result in an increase in loan delinquencies, foreclosures or repossessions, resulting in the increased charge-off amounts and the need for additional loan loss provisions in future periods. In addition, our determination as to the amount of our allowance for loan losses is subject to review by our primary banking regulators, the Department and the FDIC, as part of their examination process, which may result in the establishment of an additional provision based upon the judgment of such agencies after a review of the information available at the time of its examination. Our allowance for loan losses amounted to 1.4 of total loans and 101.6 of non-performing loans at September 30, 2021. Our allowance for loan losses at September 30, 2021 may not be sufficient to cover future loan losses. A large loss could deplete the allowance and require an increased provision to replenish the allowance, which would negatively affect earnings. Our existing residential mortgage loans exposes us to lending risks, and the geographic concentration of our loan portfolio and lending activities makes us vulnerable to a downturn in the local economy. At September 30, 2021, 202.3 million, or 28.6 of our loan portfolio, was secured by one-to-four family real estate. One-to-four family residential mortgage lending is generally sensitive to regional and local economic conditions that significantly impact the ability of borrowers to meet their loan payment obligations, making loss levels difficult to predict. Real estate values are affected by various factors, including supply and demand, changes in general or regional economic conditions, interest rates, government rules or policies and natural disasters. Declines in real estate values could cause some of our residential mortgage loans to be inadequately collateralized, which would expose us to a greater risk of loss if we seek to recover on defaulted loans by selling the real estate collateral. Future weakness in economic conditions could result in reduced loan demand and a decline in loan originations. In particular, a significant decline in real estate values would likely lead to a decrease in new construction, commercial real estate and residential mortgage loan originations and increased delinquencies and defaults in our real estate loan portfolio. Our increased emphasis on originating construction and land development and commercial real estate loans may expose us to increased lending risks. At September 30, 2021, 205.4 million, or 29.0 , of our loan portfolio consisted of construction and land development loans, and 166.0 million, or 23.5 , of our loan portfolio consisted of commercial real estate loans. Construction financing is generally considered to involve a higher degree of credit risk than long-term financing on improved, owner-occupied residential real estate. Risk of loss on a construction loan depends largely upon the accuracy of the initial estimate of the property s value at completion of construction compared to the estimated costs, including interest, of construction and other assumptions. Additionally, if the estimate of value proves to be inaccurate, we may be confronted with a project, when completed, having a value less than the loan amount. Likewise, commercial real estate loans generally expose a lender to a greater risk of loss than one-to-four family residential loans. Repayment of commercial real estate loans generally is dependent, in large part, on sufficient income from the property or business to cover operating expenses and debt service. Commercial real estate loans typically involve larger loan balances to single borrowers or groups of related borrowers compared to one-to-four family residential mortgage loans. Changes in economic conditions that are out of the control of the borrower and lender could impact the value of the security for the loan, the future cash flow of the involved property, or the marketability of a construction project with respect to loans originated for the acquisition and development of property. Additionally, any decline in real estate values may be more pronounced with 
 39 

Table of Contents 
 respect to commercial real estate properties than residential properties. Also, many of construction borrowers have more than one loan outstanding with us. Consequently, an adverse development with respect to one loan or one credit relationship can expose us to a significantly greater risk of loss compared to an adverse development with respect to a residential mortgage loan. In recent periods, the majority of our non-performing assets have related to construction loans. At September 30, 2021, three construction loans aggregating 4.1 million were considered non-performing and on non-accrual status. All of these construction loans were related to one lending relationship consisting of seven loans with a total principal balance outstanding of 6.0 million, all of which were deemed non-performing as of such date. Imposition of limits by the bank regulators on commercial and multi-family real estate lending activities could curtail our growth and adversely affect our earnings. In 2006, the FDIC, the FRB and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (collectively, the Agencies issued joint guidance entitled Concentrations in Commercial Real Estate Lending, Sound Risk Management Practices (the CRE Guidance ). Although the CRE Guidance did not establish specific lending limits, it provides that a bank s commercial real estate lending exposure could receive increased supervisory scrutiny where total non-owner-occupied commercial real estate loans, including loans secured by apartment buildings, investor commercial real estate, and construction and land loans, represent 300 or more of an institution s total risk-based capital, and the outstanding balance of the commercial real estate loan portfolio has increased by 50 or more during the preceding 36 months. Our level of commercial real estate and multi-family loans represents 337.2 of the Bank s total risk-based capital at September 30, 2021. In December 2015, the Agencies released a new statement on prudent risk management for commercial real estate lending (the 2015 Statement ). In the 2015 Statement, the Agencies, among other things, indicate the intent to continue to pay special attention to commercial real estate lending activities and concentrations going forward. If the FDIC, our primary federal banking regulator, were to impose restrictions on the amount of commercial real estate loans we can hold in our portfolio, for reasons noted above or otherwise, our earnings would be adversely affected. We have a high concentration of loans secured by real estate in our market area; adverse economic conditions in our market area have adversely affected, and may continue to adversely affect, our financial condition and result of operations Substantially all of our loans are to individuals, businesses and real estate developers located in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New York and Delaware and our business depends significantly on general economic conditions in these market areas. A deterioration in economic conditions or a prolonged weakness in the economic recovery in our primary market areas could result in the following consequences, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business: Loan delinquencies may increase; Problem assets and foreclosures may increase; Demand for our products and services may decline; The carrying value of our other real estate owned may decline; and Collateral for loans made by us, especially real estate, may continue to decline in value, in turn reducing a customer s borrowing power, and reducing the value of assets and collateral associated with our loans.

 The Company s credit standards and its on-going credit assessment processes might not protect it from significant credit losses. The Company assumes credit risk by virtue of making loans and extending loan commitments and letters of credit. We manage our credit risk through a program of underwriting standards, the review of certain credit decisions and a continuous quality assessment process of credit already extended. Our exposure to credit risk is managed through the use of consistent underwriting standards that emphasize local lending while avoiding highly leveraged transactions as well as excessive industry and other concentrations. The Company s credit administration function employs risk management techniques to help ensure that problem loans and leases are promptly identified. While these procedures are designed to provide us with the information needed to implement policy adjustments where necessary and to take appropriate corrective actions, there can be no assurance that such measures will be effective in avoiding undue credit risk. We are subject to environmental liability risk associated with the Bank s lending activities. A significant portion of our loan portfolio is secured by real estate, and we could become subject to environmental liabilities with respect to one or more of these properties. During the ordinary course of business, we may foreclose on and take title to properties securing defaulted loans. In doing so, there is a risk that hazardous or toxic substances could be found on these properties. If hazardous conditions or toxic substances are found on these properties, we may be liable for remediation costs, as well as for personal injury and property damage, civil fines and criminal penalties regardless of when the hazardous conditions or toxic substances first affected any particular property. Environmental laws may require us to incur substantial expenses to address unknown liabilities and may materially reduce the affected property s value or limit our ability to use or sell the affected property. In addition, future laws or more stringent interpretations or enforcement policies with respect to existing laws may increase our exposure to environmental liability. Although we have policies and procedures to perform an environmental review before initiating any foreclosure on nonresidential real property, these reviews may not be sufficient to detect all potential environmental hazards. The remediation costs and any other financial liabilities associated with an environmental hazard could have a material adverse effect on us. Our business strategy includes loan growth, and our financial condition and results of operations could be negatively affected if we fail to grow or fail to manage our growth effectively. Growing our operations could also cause our expenses to increase faster than our revenues. Our business strategy primarily focuses on loan growth including loan participations, funded by deposits. Achieving such growth may require us to attract customers that currently bank at other financial institutions in our market areas. Our ability to successfully grow will depend on a variety of factors, including our ability to attract and retain experienced bankers, the continued availability of desirable business opportunities, the level of competition from other financial institutions in our market areas and our ability to manage our growth. Growth opportunities may not be available or we may not be able to manage our growth successfully. If we do not manage our growth effectively, our financial condition and operating results could be negatively affected. Furthermore, there can be considerable costs involved in expanding lending capacity, and generally a period of time is required to generate the necessary revenues to offset these costs, especially in areas in which we do not have an established presence. Accordingly, any such business expansion can be expected to negatively impact our earnings until certain economies of scale are reached. Risks Related to Market Interest Rates A significant percentage of our assets is invested in securities which typically have a lower yield than our loan portfolio. Our results of operations are substantially dependent on our net interest income. At September 30, 2021, 409.8 million or 37.2 of our assets was invested in investment securities, certificates of deposit, cash and amounts due from banks. These investments yield substantially less than the loans we hold in our portfolio. The weighted average yield on such assets for the year ended September 30, 2021 was 2.60 as compared to 4.18 for loans. Accordingly, our net interest margin is lower than it would have been if a higher proportion of our interest-earning assets consisted of loans. In addition, at September 30, 2021, 305.9 million, or 93.8 of our investment securities, are classified as available for sale 
 41 

Table of Contents 
 and reported at fair value with unrealized gains or losses excluded from earnings and reported in other comprehensive income, which affects our reported equity. Accordingly, given the material size of the investment securities portfolio classified as available for sale and due to possible mark-to-market adjustments of that portion of the portfolio resulting from market conditions, we may experience greater volatility in the value of reported equity. Moreover, given that we actively manage our investment securities portfolio classified as available for sale, we may sell securities which could result in a realized loss, thereby reducing our net income. While we intend to invest a greater proportion of our assets in loans with the goal of increasing our net interest margin and net interest income, we may not be able to increase originations of loans that are acceptable to us. Higher interest rates would hurt our profitability Management is unable to predict fluctuations of market interest rates, which are affected by many factors, including inflation, recession, unemployment, monetary policy, domestic and international disorder and instability in domestic and foreign financial markets, and investor and consumer demand. Our primary source of income is net interest income, which is the difference between the interest income generated by our interest-earning assets (consisting primarily of single-family residential loans) and the interest expense generated by our interest-bearing liabilities (consisting primarily of deposits). The level of net interest income is primarily a function of the average balance of our interest-earning assets, the average balance of our interest-bearing liabilities, and the spread between the yield on such assets and the cost of such liabilities. These factors are influenced by both the pricing and mix of our interest-earning assets and our interest-bearing liabilities which, in turn, are impacted by such external factors as the local economy, competition for loans and deposits, the monetary policy of the Federal Open Market Committee of the Federal Reserve Board (the FOMC ), and market interest rates. The FOMC lowered the federal funds rate to near zer percent in 2020. However, the FOMC has indicated it expects to increase rates starting in 2022, three one quarter point increases. A sustained increase in market interest rates could adversely affect our earnings. A significant portion of our loans have fixed interest rates (or, if adjustable, are initially fixed for periods of five to 10 years) and longer terms than our deposits and borrowings. Our net interest income could be adversely affected if the rates we pay on deposits and borrowings increase more rapidly than the rates we earn on loans. As a result of our historical focus on the origination of one-to-four family residential mortgage loans, which focus has been emphasized in recent years due to asset quality issues experienced by our construction and land development lending activities, the majority of our loans have fixed interest rates. In addition, a large percentage of our investment securities and mortgage-backed securities have fixed interest rates and are classified as held to maturity. As is the case with many banks and savings institutions, our emphasis on increasing the development of core deposits, those with no stated maturity date, has resulted in our interest-bearing liabilities having a shorter duration than our assets. As of September 30, 2021, 18.9 of our loan portfolio had maturities of 10 years or more. Furthermore, at such date, 326.7 million or 46.1 of the loans due after September 30, 2021 bear adjustable interest rates. At September 30, 2021, 65.6 of our deposits had no stated maturity date and 25.7 consisted of certificates of deposit with maturities of one year or less. This imbalance can create significant earnings volatility because interest rates change over time and are currently at historical low levels. As interest rates increase, our cost of funds will increase more rapidly than the yields on the bulk of our interest-earning assets. In addition, the market value of our fixed-rate assets for example, our investment and mortgage-backed securities portfolios, would decline if interest rates increase. For example, we estimate that as of September 30, 2021, a 200 basis point increase in interest rates would have resulted in our net portfolio value declining by approximately 18.2 million or 1.2 . Net portfolio value is the difference between incoming and outgoing discounted cash flows from assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet contracts. The fair value of our investment securities can fluctuate due to market conditions outside of our control. As of September 30, 2021, the fair value of our investment securities portfolio available for sale was approximately 305.9 million. We have historically taken a conservative investment strategy, with concentrations of securities that are backed by government sponsored enterprises. Factors beyond our control can significantly influence the fair value of securities in our portfolio and can cause potential adverse changes to the fair value of these securities. These factors include, but are not limited to, rating agency actions in respect of the securities, defaults by the issuer or with respect to the underlying securities, and changes in market interest rates and continued instability in the capital markets. Any of these factors, among others, could cause other-than-temporary impairments and realized and/or unrealized losses 
 42 

Table of Contents 
 in future periods and declines in other comprehensive income, which could have a material adverse effect on us. The process for determining whether impairment of a security is other-than-temporary usually requires complex, subjective judgments about the future financial performance and liquidity of the issuer and any collateral underlying the security in order to assess the probability of receiving all contractual principal and interest payments on the security. Risks Related to Laws and Regulations Changes in laws and regulations and the cost of regulatory compliance with new laws and regulations may adversely affect our operations and/or increase our costs of operations. The Company and the Bank are subject to extensive regulation, supervision and examination by the Department and the FDIC. Such regulation and supervision governs the activities in which an institution and its holding company may engage and are intended primarily for the protection of insurance funds and the depositors and borrowers of the Bank rather than for holders of our common stock. Regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in their supervisory and enforcement activities, including the imposition of restrictions on our operations, the classification of our assets and determination of the level of our allowance for loan losses. These regulations, along with the currently existing tax, accounting, securities, insurance, monetary laws, rules, standards, policies, and interpretations control the methods by which financial institutions conduct business, implement strategic initiatives and tax compliance, and govern financial reporting and disclosures. Any change in such regulation and oversight, whether in the form of regulatory policy, regulations, legislation or supervisory action, may have a material impact on our operations. Further, changes in accounting standards can be both difficult to predict and involve judgment and discretion in their interpretation by us and our independent accounting firms. These changes could materially impact, potentially even retroactively, how we report our financial condition and results of our operations as could our interpretation of those changes. The Dodd-Frank Act is significantly changing the current bank regulatory structure and affects the lending, deposit, investment, trading and operating activities of financial institutions and their holding companies. The Dodd-Frank Act requires various federal agencies to adopt a broad range of new implementing rules and regulations, and to prepare numerous studies and reports for Congress. The federal agencies are given significant discretion in drafting the implementing rules and regulations. It will be some time before the full effect of the Dodd-Frank Act and the regulations thereunder can be assessed. The Dodd-Frank Act created a new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau with broad powers to supervise and enforce consumer protection laws. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has broad rule-making authority for a wide range of consumer protection laws that apply to all banks and savings institutions, including the authority to prohibit unfair, deceptive or abusive acts and practices. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has examination and enforcement authority over all banks with more than 10 billion in assets. Banks with 10 billion or less in assets continue to be examined for compliance with the consumer laws by their primary bank regulators. We have become subject to more stringent capital requirements, which may adversely impact our return on equity, require us to raise additional capital, or constrain us from paying dividends or repurchasing shares. In July 2013, the federal banking agencies approved a new rule that has substantially amended regulatory risk-based capital rules. The final rule implements the regulatory capital reforms from the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision Basel III and changes required by the Dodd-Frank Act. The final rule includes new minimum risk-based capital and leverage ratios, which were effective for us on January 1, 2016, and refines the definition of what constitutes capital for calculating these ratios. The new minimum capital requirements are: (i) a new common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 4.5 ; (ii) a Tier 1 to risk-based assets capital ratio of 6 (increased from 4 ); (iii) a total capital ratio of 8 (unchanged from prior rules); and (iv) a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4 . The final rule also requires unrealized gains and losses on certain available-for-sale securities holdings to be included for calculating regulatory capital requirements unless a one-time opt-out is exercised. Prudential Savings elected to opt out of the requirement under the final rule to include certain available-for-sale securities holdings for calculating its regulatory capital requirements. The final rule also establishes a capital conservation buffer of 2.5 . As a result, the Banks minimum capital ratios are as follows: (i) a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 7.0 , (ii) a Tier 1 to 
 43 

Table of Contents 
 risk-based assets capital ratio of 8.5 , and (iii) a total capital ratio of 10.5 . The new capital conservation buffer requirement began being phased-in January 2016 at 0.625 of risk-weighted assets and become fully phased in January 2019. An institution will be subject to limitations on paying dividends, engaging in share repurchases and paying discretionary bonuses if its capital level falls below the buffer amount. These limitations will establish a maximum percentage of eligible retained income that can be utilized for such actions. We are in compliance with these requirements as of September 30, 2021. The application of more stringent capital requirements could, among other things, result in lower returns on equity, require the raising of additional capital, and result in regulatory actions if we were to be unable to comply with such requirements. Furthermore, the imposition of liquidity requirements in connection with the implementation of Basel III could result in our having to lengthen the term of our funding, restructure our business models, and/or increase our holdings of liquid assets. Implementation of changes to asset risk weightings for risk-based capital calculations, items included or deducted in calculating regulatory capital and/or additional capital conservation buffers could result in management modifying its business strategy, and could limit our ability to make distributions, including paying dividends or repurchasing shares. Specifically, beginning in 2017, the Bank s ability to pay dividends is limited if it does not have the capital conservation buffer required by the new capital rules, which may further limit our ability to pay dividends to stockholders. Federal Reserve Board policy could limit our ability to pay dividends to our shareholders. The Federal Reserve Board has issued a policy statement regarding the payment of dividends and the repurchase of shares of common stock by bank holding companies. In general, the policy provides that dividends should be paid only out of current earnings and only if the prospective rate of earnings retention by the holding company appears consistent with the organization s capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. These regulatory policies could affect our ability to pay dividends, repurchase shares of common stock or otherwise engage in capital distributions. Risks Related to Our Business and Industry Generally We are a community bank and our ability to maintain our reputation is critical to the success of our business. We are a community bank, and our reputation is one of the most valuable components of our business. A key component of our business strategy is to rely on our reputation for customer service and knowledge of local markets to expand our presence by capturing new business opportunities from existing and prospective customers in our current market and contiguous areas. As such, we strive to conduct our business in a manner that enhances our reputation. This is done, in part, by recruiting, hiring and retaining employees who share our core values of being an integral part of the communities we serve, delivering superior service to our customers and caring about our customers and associates. If our reputation is negatively affected by the actions of our employees, by our inability to conduct our operations in a manner that is appealing to current or prospective customers, or otherwise, our business and, therefore, our operating results may be materially adversely affected. Strong competition within our market area could hurt our profits and slow growth. We face intense competition in making loans, attracting deposits and hiring and retaining experienced employees. This competition has made it more difficult for us to make new loans and attract deposits. Price competition for loans and deposits sometimes results in us charging lower interest rates on our loans and paying higher interest rates on our deposits, which reduces our net interest income. Competition also makes it more difficult and costly to attract and retain qualified employees. Some of the institutions with which we compete have substantially greater resources and lending limits than we have and may offer services that we do not provide. We expect competition to increase in the future as a result of legislative, regulatory and technological changes and the continuing trend of consolidation in the financial services industry. Our profitability depends upon our continued ability to compete successfully in our market area. 
 44 

Table of Contents 
 Our asset size may make it more difficult for us to compete. Our asset size may make it more difficult to compete with other financial institutions that are larger and can more easily afford to invest in the marketing and technologies needed to attract and retain customers. Because our principal source of income is the net interest income we earn on our loans and investments after deducting interest paid on deposits and other sources of funds, our ability to generate the revenues needed to cover our expenses and finance such investments is limited by the size of our loan and investment portfolios. Accordingly, we are not always able to offer new products and services as quickly as our competitors. Our lower earnings may also make it more difficult to offer competitive salaries and benefits. In addition, our smaller customer base may make it difficult to generate meaningful non-interest income from non-traditional banking activities. Finally, as a smaller institution, we are disproportionately affected by the continually increasing costs of compliance with new banking and other regulations. Our success depends on hiring and retaining certain key personnel. Our performance largely depends on the talents and efforts of highly skilled individuals. We rely on key personnel to manage and operate our business, including major revenue generating functions such as loan and deposit generation, as well as operational functions such as regulatory compliance and information technology. The loss of key staff may adversely affect our ability to maintain and manage these functions effectively, which could negatively affect our revenues. In addition, loss of key personnel could result in increased recruiting and hiring expenses, which could cause a decrease in our net income. Our continued ability to compete effectively depends on our ability to attract new employees and to retain and motivate our existing employees. Risks Related to Operational Matters If the Company fails to maintain an effective system of internal controls, it may not be able to accurately report its financial results or prevent fraud. As a result, current and potential shareholders could lose confidence in the Company s financial reporting, which could harm its business and the trading price of its common stock. The Company has established a process to document and evaluate its internal controls over financial reporting in order to satisfy the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the related regulations, which require annual management assessments of the effectiveness of the Company s internal controls over financial reporting. In this regard, management has, among other things, dedicated internal resources and engaged outside consultants to (i) assess and document the adequacy of internal controls over financial reporting, (ii) take steps to improve control processes, where appropriate, (iii) validate through testing that controls are functioning as documented and (iv) implement a continuous reporting and improvement process for internal control over financial reporting. Although the Company s management and audit committee believe that its system of internal controls is effective, the Company cannot be certain that these measures will ensure that the Company implements and maintains adequate controls over its financial processes and reporting in the future. Any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or difficulties encountered in their implementation, could harm the Company s operating results or cause the Company to fail to meet its reporting obligations. If the Company fails to correct any issues in the design or operating effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting, or fails to prevent fraud, current and potential shareholders could lose confidence in the Company s financial reporting, which could harm its business and the trading price of its common stock. The Company is subject to a variety of operational risks, including reputational risk, legal and compliance risk, and the risk of fraud or theft by employees or outsiders. The Company is exposed to many types of operational risks, including reputational risk, legal and compliance risk, the risk of fraud or theft by employees or outsiders, and unauthorized transactions by employees or operational errors, including clerical or record-keeping errors or those resulting from faulty or disabled computer or telecommunications systems. Negative public opinion can result from its actual or alleged conduct in any number of activities, including lending practices, corporate governance and acquisitions and from actions taken by government regulators and community organizations in response to those activities. Negative public opinion can adversely affect its ability to attract and keep customers and can expose the Company to litigation and regulatory action. 
 45 

Table of Contents 
 Because the nature of the financial services business involves a high volume of transactions, certain errors may be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and successfully rectified. The Company s necessary dependence upon automated systems to record and process its transaction volume may further increase the risk that technical flaws or employee tampering or manipulation of those systems will result in losses that are difficult to detect. The Company also may be subject to disruptions of its operating systems arising from events that are wholly or partially beyond its control (for example, computer viruses or electrical or telecommunications outages), which may give rise to disruption of service to customers and to financial loss or liability. The Company is further exposed to the risk that its external vendors may be unable to fulfill their contractual obligations (or will be subject to the same risk of fraud or operational errors by their respective employees as the Company is) and to the risk that its (or its vendors business continuity and data security systems prove to be inadequate. The occurrence of any of these risks could result in a diminished ability of the Company to operate its business, potential liability to clients, reputational damage and regulatory intervention, which could adversely affect its business, financial condition and results of operations, perhaps materially. The Company relies on other companies to provide key components of its business infrastructure. Third parties provide key components of the Company s business infrastructure, for example, system support and network access. While the Company has selected these third party vendors carefully, it does not control their actions. Any problems caused by these third parties, including those resulting from their failure to provide services for any reason or their poor performance of services, could adversely affect the Company s ability to deliver products and services to its customers and otherwise conduct its business. Replacing these third party vendors could also entail significant delay and expense. The Company s operations may be adversely affected by cyber security risks. In the ordinary course of business, the Company collects and stores sensitive data, including proprietary business information and personally identifiable information of our customers and employees in systems and on networks. In some cases, this confidential or proprietary information is collected compiled, processed, transmitted or stored by third parties on our behalf. The secure processing, maintenance and use of this information is critical to operations and our business strategy. The Company has invested in accepted technologies, and continually reviews processes and practices that are designed to protect our networks, computers and data from damage or unauthorized access. Despite these security measures, the Company s computer systems and infrastructure or those of third parties used by us to compile, process or store such information may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error, malfeasance, or other disruptions. A breach of any kind could compromise systems and the information stored there could be accessed, damaged or disclosed. A breach in security could result in legal claims, regulatory penalties, disruption in operations, and damage to the Company s reputation, which could adversely affect our business. Our ability to successfully compete may be reduced if we are unable to make technological advances. The banking industry is experiencing rapid changes in technology. In addition to improving customer services, effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to reduce costs. As a result, our future success will depend in part on our ability to address our customers needs by using technology. We cannot assure you that we will be able to effectively develop new technology-driven products and services or be successful in marketing these products to our customers. Many of our competitors have far greater resources than we have to invest in technology. Risks Related to Accounting Matters We expect that implementation of a new accounting standard could require us to increase our allowance for loan losses and may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. The Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB has adopted a new accounting standard that will be effective for the Bank for our fiscal year beginning on October 1, 2023. This standard, referred to as Current Expected Credit Loss, or CECL, will require financial institutions to determine periodic estimates of lifetime expected credit losses on loans, and recognize the expected credit losses as allowances for loan losses. This will change the current method of providing allowances for loan losses that are probable, which we expect may require us to increase our allowance for loan 
 46 

Table of Contents 
 losses, and to greatly increase the data we would need to collect and review to determine the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses. Any increase in our allowance for loan losses, or expenses incurred to determine the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses, may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. If our intangible assets, including goodwill, are either partially or fully impaired in the future, it would decrease earnings. We are required to test our goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis and more regularly if indicators of impairment exist. The impairment testing process considers a variety of factors, including the current market price of our common stock, the estimated net present value of our assets and liabilities and information concerning the terminal valuation of similar insured depository institutions. Future impairment testing may result in a partial or full impairment of the value of our goodwill or other identifiable intangible assets, or both. If an impairment determination is made in a future reporting period, our earnings and the book value of these intangible assets will be reduced by the amount of the impairment. However, the recording of such an impairment loss would have no impact on the tangible book value of our shares of common stock or our regulatory capital levels. Other Risks Related to our Business We may be required to transition from the use of the LIBOR interest rate index in the future. We have certain FHLB advances, brokered deposits, loans and investment securities indexed to LIBOR to calculate the loan interest rate. The continued availability of the LIBOR index is not guaranteed after 2021. We cannot predict whether and to what extent banks will continue to provide LIBOR submissions to the administrator of LIBOR or whether any additional reforms to LIBOR may be enacted. At this time, no consensus exists as to what rate or rates may become acceptable alternatives to LIBOR (with the exception of overnight repurchase agreements, which are expected to be based on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate, or SOFR). The language in our LIBOR-based contracts and financial instruments has developed over time and may have various events that trigger when a successor rate to the designated rate would be selected. If a trigger is satisfied, contracts and financial instruments may give the calculation agent discretion over the substitute index or indices for the calculation of interest rates to be selected. The implementation of a substitute index or indices for the calculation of interest rates under our loan agreements with our borrowers may result in our incurring significant expenses in effecting the transition, may result in reduced loan balances if borrowers do not accept the substitute index or indices, and may result in disputes or litigation with customers over the appropriateness or comparability to LIBOR of the substitute index or indices, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. Legal and regulatory proceedings and related matters could adversely affect us . We have been and may in the future become involved in legal and regulatory proceedings. We consider most of the proceedings to be in the normal course of our business or typical for the industry; however, it is inherently difficult to assess the outcome of these matters, and we may not prevail in any proceedings or litigation. There could be substantial costs and management diversion in such litigation and proceedings, and any adverse determination could have a materially adverse effect on our business, reputation, or our financial condition and results of our operations. Climate change may materially adversely affect the Company s business and results of operations. Concerns over the long-term effects of climate change have led and will continue to lead to governmental efforts around the world to mitigate those impacts. Consumers and businesses also may voluntarily change their behavior as a result of these concerns. The Company and its customers will need to respond to new laws and regulations as well as consumer and business preferences resulting from climate change concerns. The Company and its customers may face cost increases, asset value reductions and operating process changes. The impact on our customers will likely vary depending on their specific attributes, including reliance on or role in carbon-intensive activities. Among the impacts to the Company could be a drop in demand for our products and services, particularly in certain sectors. In addition, we could face reductions in creditworthiness on the part of some customers or in the value of assets securing loans. The Company s efforts to take these risks into account in making lending and other decisions, including by increasing our business with 
 47

 climate-friendly companies, may not be effective in protecting the Company from the negative impact of new laws and regulations or changes in consumer or business behavior. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments Not applicable. Item 2. Properties We currently conduct business from our main office and nine banking offices.

Legal Proceedings On March 31, 2016, Island View Properties, Inc. t/a Island View Crossing II and Renato J. Gualtieri Plaintiffs filed a complaint against the Bank in the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County (the CCP Action asserting, among other things, that the Bank breached various loan agreements and related agreements for a development known as 
 49 

Table of Contents 
 Island View Crossing. In its complaint, Plaintiffs seek the amount of 27 million. The Company filed objections to the complaint seeking to dismiss significant portions of Plaintiffs claims. On August 31, 2016, the Court dismissed the majority of the claims. After that order, the Company filed an answer denying Plaintiffs claims as well as a counterclaim seeking damages for failure to pay the outstanding loans and not completing the project. Discovery was ongoing and a trial was scheduled for October 2, 2017. On June 30, 2017, Plaintiff Island View Crossing II filed a Chapter 11 bankruptcy and on or about July 18, 2017, the Bank removed the CCP Action to bankruptcy court (the Removed Action ). Within the bankruptcy, Island View Crossing II, as the debtor and the Chapter 11 Trustee, filed a separate adversary proceeding against the Bank seeking to avoid certain collateral mortgages made by Island View as well as seeking to avoid certain loans made to Island View Crossing II including, but not limited to, a 1.4 million loan and a 5.5 million loan. The complaint was filed on or about December 3, 2018 and that action was ultimately consolidated with the Removed Action. The discovery phase of litigation has concluded. The parties have each filed motions for summary judgment with the Court on multiple issues. In August 2021, the court denied the Trustee s motion and granted, in part, the Bank s motion. The court has allowed for the production of expert witnesses and rebuttal reports by December 2021. A pretrial conference with the Court is scheduled for mid-February 2022. Given the stage of the case and pending motions, we are unable to determine the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome at this time. The Bank, however, intends to vigorously defend against all claims. Prudential Bancorp is involved in various legal proceedings occurring in the ordinary course of business. Management of the Company, based on discussions with litigation counsel, does not believe that such proceedings will have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or operations of Prudential Bancorp. There can be no assurance that any of the outstanding legal proceedings to which the Company is a party will not be decided adversely to the Company s interests and have a material adverse effect on the financial condition and operations of the Company.

The Fifth Program will cover 390,000 shares of common stock or approximately 5 of the Company s issued and outstanding shares (taking into account the completion of the fourth stock repurchase program announced in June 2020 covering 407,000 shares). Item 6. [Reserved] Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview At September 30, 2021, we had total assets of 1.1 billion, including total net loans of 618.2 million, aggregate investment and mortgage-backed securities of 326.0 million (both available for sale and held to maturity), total deposits of 711.5 million, total borrowings of 232.0 million and total stockholders equity of 130.5 million. The Company conducts community banking activities by accepting deposits and making loans secured by properties located primarily in our market area. Our lending products consist of residential mortgage loans, including loans

 for sale in the secondary market, along with commercial real estate, multi-family residential and construction loans. The Company also originates commercial business and consumer loans in an effort to maintain strong customer relationships. The worldwide COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant volatility and disruption in the financial markets both in the United States and globally. We are working with both residential and commercial borrowers to help them meet the unexpected financial challenges stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic and will continue to do so. Despite the challenging current market and economic conditions, the Company continues to maintain capital substantially in excess of regulatory requirements. Furthermore, most of our assets and liabilities are monetary in nature; therefore the current levels of increased inflation, which affect the Company s cost of operations, are less important than the impact of interest rate shifts on our financial performance. This Management s Discussion and Analysis section is intended to assist in understanding the financial condition and results of operations of Prudential Bancorp. The results of operations of Prudential Bancorp are primarily dependent on the results of the Bank. The information contained in this section should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates In reviewing and understanding financial information for Prudential Bancorp, you are encouraged to read and understand the significant accounting policies used in preparing our financial statements. These policies are described in Note 2 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 hereof. The accounting and financial reporting policies of Prudential Bancorp conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America U.S. GAAP and to general practices within the banking industry. Accordingly, the financial statements require certain estimates, judgments and assumptions, which are believed to be reasonable, based upon the information available. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as well as contingent assets and contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the periods presented. The following accounting policies comprise those that management believes are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results. These policies require numerous estimates or economic assumptions that may prove inaccurate or may be subject to variations which may significantly affect our reported results and financial condition for the period or in future periods. Further, subsequent changes in economic or market conditions could have a material impact on these estimates and our financial condition and operating results in future periods. There have been no significant changes in our application of accounting policies since September 30, 2020. For additional information concerning critical accounting policies, see Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. and the discussion below. Allowance for Loan Losses . The allowance for loan losses is established through a provision for loan losses charged to expense. Losses are charged against the allowance for loan losses when management believes that the collectability in full of the principal of a loan is unlikely. Subsequent recoveries are added to the allowance. The allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level that management considers adequate to provide for estimated losses and impairments based upon an evaluation of known and inherent losses in the loan portfolio that are both probable and reasonable to estimate. Loan impairment is evaluated based on the fair value of collateral or estimated net realizable value. It is the policy of management to provide for losses on unidentified loans in its portfolio in addition to criticized and classified loans. Management monitors its allowance for loan losses at least quarterly and makes adjustments to the allowance through the provision for loan losses as economic conditions and other pertinent factors indicate. The quarterly review and adjustment of the qualitative factors employed in the allowance methodology and the updating of historic loss experience allow for timely reaction to emerging conditions and trends. In this context, a series of qualitative factors are used in a methodology as a measurement of how current circumstances are affecting the loan portfolio. Included in these qualitative factors are: Levels of past due, classified, criticized and non-accrual loans, TDRs and loan modifications; 
 52 

Table of Contents 
 Nature and volume of loans; Changes in lending policies and procedures, underwriting standards, collections, charge-offs and recoveries and for commercial loans, the level of loans being approved with exceptions to lending policy; Experience, ability and depth of management and staff; National and local economic and business conditions, including various market segments, especially in light of the continuing COVID-19 pandemic on both the national and local economies; Quality of the Company s loan review system and degree of Board oversight; Concentrations of credit and changes in levels of such concentrations; and Effect of external factors on the level of estimated credit losses in the current portfolio. 
 In determining the allowance for loan losses, management has established both specific and general pooled allowances. Values assigned to the qualitative factors and those developed from historic loss experience provide a dynamic basis for the calculation of reserve factors for both pass-rated loans (general pooled allowance) and for criticized and classified loans. The amount of the specific allowance is determined through a loan-by-loan analysis of certain large dollar commercial real estate loans. Loans not individually reviewed are evaluated as a group using reserve factor percentages based on historical loss experience and the qualitative factors described above. In determining the appropriate level of the general pooled allowance, management makes estimates based on internal risk ratings, which take into account such factors as debt service coverage, loan-to-value ratios and external factors. Estimates are periodically measured against actual loss experience. This evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires material estimates including, among others, exposure at default, the amount and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans, value of collateral, estimated losses on our commercial, construction and residential loan portfolios and historical loss experience. All of these estimates may be susceptible to significant change. While management analyzed its allowance in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, such analysis will need to be continually refined and reviewed in light of the ongoing nature of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. While management uses the best information available to make loan loss allowance evaluations, adjustments to the allowance may be necessary based on changes in economic and other conditions or changes in accounting guidance. In addition, the Department and the FDIC, as an integral part of their examination processes, periodically review our allowance for loan losses. The Department and the FDIC may require the recognition of adjustments to the allowance for loan losses based on their judgment of information available to them at the time of their examinations. To the extent that actual outcomes differ from management s estimates, additional provisions to the allowance for loan losses may be required that would adversely affect earnings in future periods. Investment and Mortgage-Backed Securities Available for Sale. Where quoted prices are available in an active market, securities are classified within Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy. If quoted market prices are not available, then fair values are estimated using quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics or discounted cash flows and are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. In certain cases where there is limited activity or less transparency around inputs to the valuation, securities are classified within Level 3 of the valuation hierarchy, although there were no securities with that classification as of September 30, 2021 or 2020. Management evaluates securities for other-than-temporary impairment at least on a quarterly basis, and more frequently when economic or market concerns warrant such evaluation. In light of the COVID-19 pandemic, management is taking into account the effects the pandemic may have on securities and their impairment. The Company determines whether the unrealized losses are temporary or are considered other than temporary. The Company determines whether the unrealized losses are temporary in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The evaluation is based upon factors such as the 
 53 

Table of Contents 
 creditworthiness of the issuers/guarantors, the underlying collateral, if applicable, and the continuing performance of the securities. In addition, the Company also considers the likelihood that the security will be required to be sold by a regulatory agency, our internal intent not to dispose of the security prior to maturity and whether the entire cost basis of the security is expected to be recovered. In determining whether the cost basis will be recovered, management evaluates other facts and circumstances that may be indicative of an other-than-temporary impairment condition. This includes, but is not limited to, an evaluation of the type of security, length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than cost, and near-term prospects of the issuer. In addition, certain assets are measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis; that is, the instruments are not measured at fair value on an ongoing basis but are subject to fair value adjustments in certain circumstances (for example, when there is evidence of impairment). The Company measures impaired loans and loans transferred into real estate owned at fair value on a non-recurring basis. Valuation techniques and models utilized for measuring financial assets and liabilities are reviewed and validated by the Company at least quarterly. Derivatives. The Company uses interest rate swaps and caps as part of its interest rate risk management strategy. Interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges involve the payment of either fixed or variable-rate amounts in exchange for the receipt of variable or fixed-rate amounts from a counterparty, respectively. The Company uses interest rate swaps to manage its exposure to changes in fair value. Interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges involve the receipt of variable-rate payments from a counterparty in exchange for the Company making fixed-rate payments over the life of the agreements without the exchange of the underlying notional amount. Income Taxes. The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The Company records deferred income taxes that reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. Management exercises significant judgment in the evaluation of the amount and timing of the recognition of the resulting tax assets and liabilities. The judgments and estimates required for the evaluation are updated based upon changes in business factors and the tax laws. If actual results differ from the assumptions and other considerations used in estimating the amount and timing of tax recognized, there can be no assurance that additional expenses will not be required in future periods. In evaluating our ability to recover deferred tax assets, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including our past operating results and our forecast of future taxable income. In determining future taxable income, we make assumptions for the amount of taxable income, the reversal of temporary differences and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies. These assumptions require us to make judgments about our future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we use to manage our business. Any reduction in estimated future taxable income may require us to record an additional valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets. An increase in the valuation allowance would result in additional income tax expense in the period and could have a significant impact on our future earnings. U.S. GAAP prescribes a minimum probability threshold that a tax position must meet before a financial statement benefit is recognized. The Company recognizes, when applicable, interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for income taxes in the consolidated income statement. Assessment of uncertain tax positions requires careful consideration of the technical merits of a position based on management s analysis of tax regulations and interpretations. Significant judgment may be involved in the assessment of the tax position.

 (1) With the exception of end of period ratios, all ratios are based on average monthly balances during the indicated periods. (2) Average interest rate spread represents the difference between the average yield earned on interest-earning assets and the average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest margin represents net interest income as a percentage of average interest-earning assets. (3) The efficiency ratio represents the ratio of non-interest expense divided by the sum of net interest income and non-interest income. (4) Asset quality ratios and capital ratios are end of period ratios, except for net charge-offs to average loans receivable. (5) Non-performing assets generally consist of all loans on non-accrual, loans which are 90 days or more past due as to principal or interest, and real estate acquired through foreclosure or acceptance of a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure. Non-performing assets and non-performing loans also include loans classified as TDRs due to being recently restructured and placed on non-accrual in connection with such restructuring. The TDRs in most cases are performing in accordance with their restructured terms. It is the Company s policy to cease accruing interest on all loans which are 90 days or more past due as to interest and/or principal. (6) The Company is not subject to the regulatory capital ratios imposed by Basel III on bank holding companies because the Company is deemed to be a small bank holding company.

At September 30, 2021, the investment portfolio had decreased by 117.2 million to 326.0 million as compared to 443.2 million at September 30, 2020 primarily as a result of investment securities sales, calls and paydowns of amortizing mortgage-backed securities. Partially offsetting the decrease, net loans receivable increased by 29.9 million to 618.2 million at September 30, 2021 from 588.3 million at September 30, 2020 due primarily to the continued efforts to expand our commercial real estate and commercial business portfolio. Cash and cash equivalents decreased by 35.4 million to 82.7 million at September 30, 2021 compared to 117.1 million at September 30, 2020. Total liabilities decreased by 124.2 million to 970.0 million at September 30, 2021 as compared to September 30, 2020 due primarily to a 59.4 million decrease in deposits and a 53.2 million decrease in FHLB borrowings. We have consciously allowed higher costing FHLB borrowings and certificates of deposit to run off at maturity as part of our efforts to both reduce our cost of funds as well as improve our net interest margin. Total stockholders equity increased by 1.3 million to 130.5 million at September 30, 2021 from 129.1 million at September 30, 2020. The increase was primarily due to net income of 7.8 million recognized during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021. Also contributing to the increase was an after tax 5.3 million increase in the fair value of interest rate swap arrangements. These increases were largely offset by the cost of net stock repurchases totaling 5.0 million, an after tax decrease in fair value of investment securities available for sale of 4.5 million and dividend payments totaling 2.2 million during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021. .

 Results of Operations for the Years Ended September 30, 2021, 2020 and 2019 General. 2021 vs. 2020. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021, the Company recognized net income of 7.8 million, or 0.98 per diluted share, as compared to net income of 9.6 million, or 1.12 per diluted share, for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020. 2020 vs. 2019. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020, the Company recognized net income of 9.6 million, or 1.12 per diluted share, as compared to net income of 9.5 million, or 1.07 per diluted share, for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019. Net Interest Income. 2021 vs. 2020. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021, net interest income was 23.2 million as compared to 22.8 million for fiscal 2020. The increase was due to a 4.6 million, or 23.8 , decrease in interest paid on deposits and borrowings. This was largely offset by a decrease of 4.2 million, or 9.9 , in interest income. The weighted average cost of borrowings and deposits decreased to 1.53 for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021 from 1.79 for fiscal 2020 primarily due to decreases in market rates of interest. The decrease in interest income was primarily due to the decrease in the weighted average balance of interest-earning assets of 99.3 million and to a lesser extent by the 5 basis point decline to 3.49 in the weighted average yield earned on our interest-earning assets. The decrease in the average balance of interest-earning assets was primarily due to paydowns in the investment portfolio, primarily mortgage-backed securities. 2020 vs. 2019. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020, net interest income was 22.8 million as compared to 24.8 million for fiscal 2019. The decrease primarily was due to a decrease of 1.6 million, or 6.0 , in interest on loans combined with a 136,000 or 0.7 increase in interest expense. The weighted average yield on interest-earning assets decreased by 38 basis points, to 3.54 , for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020 from 3.92 for fiscal 2019 primarily due to the reduction in market yields of interest which created downward pressure on our yields in all interest-earning asset categories, in particular commercial real estate and construction loans which generally bear adjustable rates. The increase in interest expense was due to a 74.7 million increase in the average balance of interest-bearing liabilities used to fund growth during fiscal 2020. The weighted average cost of borrowings and deposits decreased by 12 basis points to 1.79 for fiscal 2020 from 1.91 for fiscal 2019. Provision for Loan Losses. 2021 vs. 2020 . The Company recorded provisions for loan losses of 200,000 for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021, compared to a 3.0 million provision for loan losses for fiscal 2020, as the 3.0 million provision expense incurred in fiscal 2020, combined with minimal charge-offs, was deemed sufficient to maintain the allowance at a level sufficient to cover all inherent and probable losses in the current portfolio prior to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021. During the fiscal year ending September 30, 2021, the Company recorded one charge off of 40,000 while during the same periods the Company recorded recoveries aggregating 54,000. During the fiscal year ending September 30, 2020, the Company recorded charge offs of 145,000. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020, the Company recorded recoveries aggregating 30,000. Although our COVID-19 loan deferrals were as high as 149.7 million during portions of fiscal 2020, all existing deferrals had ended by September 30, 2020. All of the loans which had been on deferral were current as of September 30, 2021. The allowance for loan losses totaled 8.5 million, or 1.4 of total loans, and 101.6 of total non-performing loans at September 30, 2021 (which included loans acquired at their fair value as a result of the acquisition of Polonia Bancorp as of January 1, 2017) as compared to 8.3 million, or 1.4 of total loans and 63.7 of total non-performing loans at September 30, 2020. The Company believes that the allowance for loan losses at September 30, 2021 was sufficient to cover all inherent and known losses associated with the loan portfolio at such date.

 2020 vs. 2019 . The Company recorded provisions for loan losses of 3.0 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020, compared to a 100,000 provision for loan losses for fiscal 2019, primarily due to the continued uncertainty associated with the economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, especially in light of the increasing level of cases of COVID-19 in 2020, and the potential credit deterioration caused thereby. Minimal delinquencies had occurred as of September 30, 2020 due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. There were no loan deferments outstanding as of September 30, 2020 and all existing deferrals had ended by September 30, 2020 compared to loans on deferral totaling 149.7 million, or 21.6 of total loans at June 30, 2020. Two participation interests in commercial real estate loans aggregating 10.0 million, or 1.5 of total loans, each entered into a subsequent deferral period during October 2020. These deferments were not considered to be TDRs as of September 30, 2020 as all applicable borrowers were current as of December 31, 2019 and the request for the deferments were related to the current economic conditions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, and not by underlying weaknesses within the respective loans. During the fiscal year ending September 30, 2020, the Company recorded charge offs of 145,000 and recoveries aggregating 30,000. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019, the Company recorded two charge offs amounting to 38,000. Recoveries of 166,000 were recognized during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019 . The allowance for loan losses totaled 8.3 million, or 1.4 of total loans and 63.7 of total non-performing loans at September 30, 2020 as compared to 5.4 million, or 0.9 of total loans and 38.7 of total non-performing loans at September 30, 2019. Non-interest Income. 2021 vs. 2020. With respect to the year ended September 30, 2021, non-interest income amounted to 3.6 million compared with 8.1 million for fiscal 2020. The higher level of non-interest income experienced in fiscal 2020 was primarily attributable to the aggregate 6.0 million of gains on sale of investment securities compared to 1.6 million for fiscal 2021 reflecting the sale in fiscal 2020 of 142.1 million of investment securities. 2020 vs. 2019. With respect to the year ended September 30, 2020, non-interest income amounted to 8.1 million compared with 3.1 million for fiscal 2019. The increase experienced in the 2020 period was primarily attributable to the gain on sale of investment securities totaling 6.0 million compared to gains of totaling 1.1 million during fiscal 2020. The investment securities sales were consummated in fiscal 2020 to recognize gains in the portfolio in order to take advantage of the historically low interest rate environment which resulted in significant appreciation in the fair value of such investments. Non-interest Expense. 2021 vs. 2020. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021, non-interest expense increased 904,000 to 17.6 million, compared to 16.7 million in fiscal 2020. The increase was due in large part to the hiring of additional personnel in our lending operations to support the continued expansion of our lending activities. 2020 vs. 2019. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020, non-interest expense increased 660,000 to 16.7 million, compared to 16.1 million in fiscal 2019. The increase was due in large part to the hiring of additional personnel in our lending operations to support our expanded lending activities. Partially offsetting this increase for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020 was a decrease in occupancy and advertising expense as the Company maintained its focus on the continued implementation of operating efficiencies. The efficiency ratio for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020 improved to 54.1 from 58.4 for fiscal 2020. Income Tax Expense. 2021 vs. 2020 . For the year ended September 30, 2021, the Company recorded income tax expense of 1.3 million, compared to 1.6 million for fiscal 2020. The reduction in income tax expense in fiscal 2021 was primarily due to the corresponding reduction in pre-tax income during the 2021 period.

Table of Contents 
 2020 vs. 2019 . For the year ended September 30, 2020, the Company recorded income tax expense of 1.6 million, compared to 2.2 million for fiscal 2019. The reduction in income tax expense in fiscal 2020 was primarily due to tax benefits recognized as a result of stock compensation plans. COVID-19 Related Information As noted above, in response to the current situation surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company is providing assistance to its customers in a variety of ways. The Company participated in the PPP loan program offered under the CARES Act as a Small Business Administration SBA lender. During the quarter ended June 30, 2020, we had originated 63 requests for PPP loans totaling approximately 5.1 million. These loans were sold during the quarter ended September 30, 2020 at a net gain of 111,000. No additional PPP loans were originated during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020. We continue to work closely with our loan customers to effectively manage our portfolio through the ongoing uncertainty surrounding the duration, impact and government response to the crisis. The primary method of relief to address COVID-19 related issues was to allow the borrower to defer their loan payments for three months (and extending the term of the loan accordingly). The CARES Act and regulatory guidelines suspend temporarily the determination of certain loan modifications related to the COVID-19 pandemic from being treated as TDRs. See Business Lending Activities - Asset Quality above . While the Company s banking operations were not restricted by the government stay-at-home orders, the Company took steps to protect its employees and customers by providing for remote working for many employees, enhancing cleaning procedures for the Company s offices, in particular its branch offices, requiring face masks to be worn by employees and maintaining appropriate social distancing in our offices. The Company continues to assess and monitor the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and will take additional such steps as are necessary to protect its employees and assist its depositor and borrower customers during this difficult time. Liquidity and Capital Resources Liquidity Liquidity is the ability to maintain cash flows that are adequate to fund operations and meet other obligations on a timely and cost-effective basis in various market conditions. The ability of the Company to meet its current financial obligations is a function of balance sheet structure, the ability to liquidate assets and the availability of alternative sources of funds. To meet the needs of the clients and manage the risk of the Company, the Company engages in liquidity planning and management. Our primary sources of funds are from deposits, scheduled principal and interest payments on loans, loan prepayments and the maturity of loans, mortgage-backed securities and other investments, and other funds provided from operations. While scheduled payments from the amortization of loans and mortgage-backed securities and maturing investment securities are relatively predictable sources of funds, deposit flows and loan prepayments can be greatly influenced by general interest rates, economic conditions and competition. We also maintain excess funds in short-term, interest-bearing assets that provide additional liquidity. At September 30, 2021, our cash and cash equivalents amounted to 82.7 million. In addition, our available-for-sale investment and mortgage-backed securities amounted to an aggregate of 306.0 million at September 30, 2021. We use our liquidity to fund existing and future loan commitments, to fund maturing certificates of deposit and demand deposit withdrawals, to invest in other interest-earning assets, and to meet operating expenses. At September 30, 2021, we had certificates of deposit maturing within the next 12 months amounting to 182.7 million. We anticipate that a significant portion of the maturing certificates of deposit will be redeposited with us unless we determine to lower rates to below those of our competition in order to facilitate the reduction of higher cost deposits during periods when there is excess cash on hand or in order to satisfy our asset/liability goals. There were no deposits as of September 30, 2021 requiring the pledging of collateral.

Table of Contents 
 In addition to cash flows from loan and securities payments and prepayments as well as from sales of available for sale securities, we have significant borrowing capacity available to fund liquidity requirements should the need arise. As of September 30, 2021, the Bank had 101.7 million of available borrowing capacity from the FHLB of Pittsburgh along with a line of credit that has been established with the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia and a 12.5 million line of credit with Atlantic Community Bankers Bank ACBB )(neither one which was drawn against in fiscal 2021). In addition, the Bank has the ability to generate brokered certificates of deposit (and has used such deposits on occasion, including in fiscal 2021). Derivatives Derivatives. To remain competitive in our local lending area and to support the Company s asset/liability positioning, on occasion the Bank enters into interest rate swap contracts to control its funding costs. Derivative financial instruments include futures, forwards, interest rate swaps, option contracts, and other financial instruments with similar characteristics. These instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the consolidated statements of financial condition. Commitments to extend credit generally have fixed expiration dates and may require additional collateral from the borrower if deemed necessary. Commitments to extend credit are not recorded as an asset or liability by us until the instrument is exercised. Commitments The following table summarizes our outstanding commitments to originate loans and to advance additional amounts pursuant to outstanding letters of credit, lines of credit and undisbursed construction loans at September 30, 2021. 

Total Amount of Commitment Expiration - Per Period Amounts Less than 1-3 3-5 After 5 Committed 1 Year Years Years Years (In Thousands) Letters of credit 1,162 1,162 Lines of credit 68,081 24,752 35,724 652 6,953 Undisbursed portions of loans in process 80,619 33,504 47,115 Commitments to originate loans 34,931 34,931 Total commitments 184,793 94,349 82,839 652 6,953 Contractual Cash Obligations The following table summarizes our contractual cash obligations at September 30, 2021. 

Less than 1-3 3-5 After 5 Total 1 Year Years Years Years (In Thousands) Certificates of deposit 244,877 182,720 53,245 8,912 Advances from FHLB 232,025 65,477 166,548 Total long-term debt 476,902 248,197 219,793 8,912 Short-term borrowings, FHLB Advances from borrowers for taxes and insurance 1,698 1,698 Operating lease obligations 1,297 213 436 357 291 Total contractual obligations 479,897 250,108 220,229 9,269 291 Our cash flows are comprised of three primary classifications: cash flows from operating activities, investing activities, and financing activities. Net cash provided by operating activities was 5.0 million and 22.3 million for the years ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The 5.0 million of net cash provided in fiscal 2021 was primarily due to net income of 7.8 million combined with 6.5 million of proceeds from the sales of loans, partially offset by the effects of other operating activities including 6.4 million of loans originated for sale. Net cash provided by investing activities, which consist primarily of disbursements for loan originations and purchases and the purchase of investment and mortgage-backed securities, offset by principal collections on loans and proceeds from maturing investment and 
 63 

Table of Contents 
 mortgage-backed securities and from the sale of investment and mortgage-backed securities, was 81.9 million for the year ended September 30, 2021, primarily due to the purchase or origination of 280.3 million of loans, offset in part by 246.8 million of principal collections on loans combined with purchases of investment and mortgage-backed securities aggregating 56.9 million, offset by maturities, pre-payments, proceeds from sales and calls of investment and mortgage-backed securities totaling of 169.0 million. By comparison, net cash provided by investing activities was 129.3 million for the year ended September 30, 2020 primarily due to proceeds from the sale of investment and mortgage-backed securities totaling 142.1 million as compared to 26.1 million for the year ended September 30, 2021. Net cash used in financing activities was 121.3 million for the year ended September 30, 2021 primarily due to a decrease in deposits of 59.4 million combined with a 53.2 million decrease in borrowings from the FHLB of Pittsburgh. Net cash provided by financing activities was 82.4 million for the year ended September 30, 2020 primarily due to the repayment of 91.6 million in FHLB advances, partially offset by an increase in deposits of 25.5 million. In both fiscal periods, the Bank made a concerted effort to reduce the level of certificates of deposit which are generally higher costing than demand deposits, NOW accounts and savings accounts The Company is a separate legal entity from the Bank and must provide for its own liquidity and pay its own operating expenses. Sources of capital and liquidity for the Company include distributions from the Bank and the issuance of debt or equity securities. At September 30, 2021, the Company (on an unconsolidated basis) had liquid assets of 854,000.We anticipate that we will continue to have sufficient funds and alternative funding sources to meet our current commitments for at least the next 12 months. Capital Resources At September 30, 2021, the Bank exceeded all of its regulatory capital requirements with a Tier 1 leverage capital level of 123.8 million, or 11.5 of adjusted total assets, which is above the well-capitalized required level of 54.8 million, or 5.0 ; and total risk-based capital of 132.7 million, or 17.6 of risk-weighted assets, which is above the well-capitalized required level of 75.6 million, or 10.0 . Management is not aware of any conditions or events that would change our category. The Company is not subject to regulatory capital requirements imposed by Basel III on bank holding companies because it is deemed to be a small bank holding company. Exposure to Changes in Interest Rates Gap Analysis. The matching of assets and liabilities may be analyzed by examining the extent to which such assets and liabilities are interest rate sensitive and by monitoring the Bank s interest rate sensitivity gap. An asset or liability is said to be interest rate sensitive within a specific time period if it will mature or reprice within that time period. The interest rate sensitivity gap is defined as the difference between the amount of interest-earning assets maturing or repricing within a specific time period and the amount of interest-bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within that same time period. A gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities. A gap is considered negative when the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive assets. During a period of rising interest rates, a negative gap would tend to affect adversely net interest income while a positive gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income. Conversely, during a period of falling interest rates, a negative gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income while a positive gap would tend to affect adversely net interest income. The table on the next page sets forth the amounts of our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities outstanding at September 30, 2021, which we expect, based upon certain assumptions, to reprice or mature in each of the future time periods shown (the GAP Table ). Except as stated below, the amounts of assets and liabilities shown which reprice or mature during a particular period were determined in accordance with the earlier of term to repricing or the contractual maturity of the asset or liability. The table sets forth an approximation of the projected repricing of assets and liabilities at September 30, 2021, on the basis of contractual maturities, anticipated prepayments, and scheduled rate adjustments within a three-month period and subsequent selected time intervals. The loan amounts in the table reflect principal balances expected to be redeployed and/or repriced as a result of contractual amortization and anticipated prepayments of adjustable-rate loans and fixed-rate loans, and as a result of contractual rate adjustments on adjustable-rate loans. Annual prepayment rates for adjustable-rate and fixed-rate single-family and multi-family residential and commercial mortgage loans are assumed to range from 11.9 to 27.9 . The annual prepayment rate for mortgage-backed 
 64 

Table of Contents 
 securities is assumed to range from 0.5 to 24.4 . Money market deposit accounts, savings accounts and interest-bearing checking accounts are assumed to have annual rates of withdrawal, or decay rates, based on information from an internal analysis of our accounts up to a maximum of ten years.

 (1) Interest-earning assets are included in the period in which the balances are expected to be redeployed and/or repriced as a result of anticipated prepayments, scheduled rate adjustments and contractual maturities. (2) For purposes of the gap analysis, loans receivable includes non-performing loans, gross of the allowance for loan losses and unamortized discounts and deferred loan fees. (3) Includes restricted stock in the FHLB of Pittsburgh and ACBB. (4) Interest-rate sensitivity gap represents the difference between total interest-earning assets and total interest-bearing liabilities. 
 Certain shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the foregoing table. For example, although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing, they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates. Also, the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates, while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates. Additionally, certain assets, such as adjustable-rate loans, have features which restrict changes in interest rates both on a short-term basis and over the life of the asset. Further, in the event of a change in interest rates, prepayment and early withdrawal levels would likely deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the table. Finally, the ability of many borrowers to service their adjustable-rate loans may decrease in the event of an interest rate increase. Net Portfolio Value Analysis. Our interest rate sensitivity also is monitored by management through the use of a model which generates estimates of the changes in our net portfolio value NPV over a range of interest rate scenarios. NPV is the present value of expected cash flows from assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet contracts. The NPV ratio, under any interest rate scenario, is defined as the NPV in that scenario divided by the market value of assets in the same 
 65 

Table of Contents 
 scenario. The following table sets forth our NPV as of September 30, 2021 and reflects the changes to NPV as a result of immediate and sustained changes in interest rates as indicated. 

Change in Interest Rates NPV as of Portfolio In Basis Points Net Portfolio Value Value of Assets (Rate Shock) Amount Change Change NPV Ratio Change (Dollars in Thousands) 300 128,307 (27,968) (17.90) 12.51 (1.84) 200 138,035 (18,240) (11.67) 13.20 (1.15) 100 148,006 (8,269) (5.29) 13.86 (0.49) Static 156,275 14.35 (100) 159,625 3,350 2.14 14.47 0.12 (200) 165,437 9,162 5.86 14.86 0.51 (300) 184,143 27,868 17.83 16.23 1.88 At September 30, 2020, the Company s NPV was 152.4 million or 12.3 of the market value of assets. Following a 200 basis point increase in interest rates, the Company s post shock NPV would have been 160.9 million or 13.6 of the market value of assets, an increase of approximately 5.5 . The change in the NPV ratio or Company s sensitivity measure was a decrease of 111 basis points. As is the case with the GAP Table, certain shortcomings are inherent in the methodology used in the above interest rate risk measurements. Modeling changes in NPV require the making of certain assumptions which may or may not reflect the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates. In this regard, the models presented assume that the composition of our interest sensitive assets and liabilities existing at the beginning of a period remains constant over the period being measured and also assumes that a particular change in interest rates is reflected uniformly across the yield curve regardless of the duration to maturity or repricing of specific assets and liabilities. Accordingly, although the NPV model provides an indication of interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time, such model is not intended to and does not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on net interest income and will differ from actual results.

 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Prudential Bancorp, Inc. Opinion on the Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of financial condition of Prudential Bancorp, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company as of September 30, 2021 and 2020; the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, changes in stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2021; and the related notes to the consolidated financial statements (collectively, the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of September 30, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2021, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent, with respect to the Company, in accordance with U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit Matters The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements; and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter, in any way, our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.

 Allowance for Loan Losses (ALL) Description of the Matter The Company s loan portfolio totaled 707.6 million as of September 30, 2021, and the associated ALL was 8.5 million. As discussed in Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements, determining the amount of the ALL requires significant judgment about the collectability of loans, which includes an assessment of quantitative factors such as historical loss experience within each risk category of loans and testing of certain commercial loans for impairment. Management applies additional qualitative adjustments to reflect the inherent losses that exist in the loan portfolio at the statement of financial condition date that are not reflected in the historical loss experience. Qualitative adjustments are made based upon changes in lending policies and procedures, economic conditions, changes in the loan portfolio mix, trends in loan delinquencies and classified loans, loan review quality and board oversight, and concentrations of credit risk for the commercial loan portfolios. We identified these qualitative adjustments within the ALL as critical audit matters because they involve a high degree of subjectivity. In turn, auditing management s judgments regarding the qualitative factors applied in the ALL calculation involved a high degree of subjectivity. How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit We gained an understanding of the Company s process for establishing the ALL, including the qualitative adjustments made to the ALL. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company s ALL process, which included, among others, management s review and approval controls designed to assess the need and level of qualitative adjustments to the ALL, as well as the reliability of the data utilized to support management s assessment. To test the qualitative adjustments, we evaluated the appropriateness of management s methodology and assessed whether all relevant risks were reflected in the ALL. Regarding the measurement of the qualitative adjustments, we evaluated the completeness, accuracy, and relevance of the data and inputs utilized in management s estimate. For example, we compared the inputs and data to the Company s historical loan performance data, and considered the existence of new or contrary information. Furthermore, we analyzed the changes in the components of the qualitative reserves relative to changes in external market factors, the Company s loan portfolio, and asset quality trends, which included the evaluation of management s ability to capture and assess relevant data from both external sources and internal reports on loan customers and the supporting documentation for substantiating revisions to qualitative factors. We also utilized internal credit review specialists with knowledge to evaluate the appropriateness of management s risk-rating processes, to ensure that the risk ratings applied to the commercial loan portfolio were reasonable. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. We have served as the Company s auditor since 2009. Cranberry Township, Pennsylvania December 17, 2021

 par value. The stock does not have a readily determinable fair value and as such is classified as restricted stock, carried at cost and evaluated for impairment by management. The stock s value is determined by the ultimate recoverability of the par value rather than by recognizing temporary declines. The determination of whether the par value will ultimately be recovered is influenced by criteria such as the following: (a) the significance of the decline in net assets of the FHLB as compared to the capital stock amount and the length of time this situation has persisted; (b) commitments by the FHLB to make payments required by law or regulation and the level of such payments in relation to the operating performance; (c) the impact of legislative and regulatory changes on the customer base of the FHLB; and (d) the liquidity position of the FHLB. The FHLB of Pittsburgh continues to report net income, continues to declare quarterly cash dividends and had its Aaa bond rating affirmed by Moody s and its AA+ rating affirmed by Standard and Poor s, which ratings during 2021 remained unchanged as of September 30, 2021. With consideration given to these factors, management concluded that the stock was not impaired at September 30, 2021 or 2020.

 Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements In August 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-06, Presentation of Financial Statements (Topic 205), Financial Services Depository and Lending (Topic 942), and Financial Services Investment Companies (Topic 946): Amendments to SEC Paragraphs Pursuant to SEC Final Rule Releases No. 33-10786, Amendments to Financial Disclosures about Acquired and Disposed Businesses, and No. 33-10835, Update of Statistical Disclosures for Bank and Savings and Loan Registrants (SEC Update) , to amend SEC paragraphs in the Accounting Standards Codification to reflect the issuance of SEC Release No. 33-10786, Amendments to Financial Disclosures about Acquired and Disposed Businesses , and No. 33-10835, Update of Statistical Disclosures for Bank and Savings and Loan Registrants . This ASU was effective upon issuance and did not have a significant impact on the Company s financial statements. In January 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-4, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting, March 2020 , to provide temporary optional expedients and exceptions to the U.S. GAAP guidance on contract modifications and hedge accounting to ease the financial reporting burdens of the expected market transition from the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) and other interbank offered rates to alternative reference rates, such as the Secured Overnight Financing Rate. Entities can elect not to apply certain modification accounting requirements to contracts affected by what the guidance calls reference rate reform, if certain criteria are met. An entity that makes this election would not have to remeasure the contracts at the modification date or reassess a previous accounting determination. Also, entities can elect various optional expedients that would allow them to continue applying hedge accounting for hedging relationships affected by reference rate reform, if certain criteria are met, and can make a one-time election to sell and/or reclassify held-to-maturity debt securities that reference an interest rate affected by reference rate reform. The amendments in this ASU are effective for all entities upon issuance through June 30, 2022. The update has not had a significant impact on the Company s financial position and/or results of operations. In January 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-01, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848) , which provides optional temporary guidance for entities transitioning away from LIBOR and other interbank offered rates (IBORs) to new reference rates so that derivatives affected by the discounting transition are explicitly eligible for certain optional expedients and exceptions within Topic 848. ASU 2021-01 clarifies that the derivatives affected by the discounting transition are explicitly eligible for certain optional expedients and exceptions in Topic 848. ASU 2021-01 is effective immediately for all entities. Entities may elect to apply the amendments on a full retrospective basis as of any date from the beginning of an interim period that includes or is subsequent to December 12, 2020, or on a prospective basis to new modifications from any date within an interim period that includes or is subsequent to the date of the issuance of a final update, up to the date that financial statements are available to be issued. The amendments in this update do not apply to contract modifications made, as well as new hedging relationships entered into, after December 31, 2022, and to existing

These securities represent asset-backed issues that are issued or guaranteed by a U.S. Government sponsored agency or carry the full faith and credit of the United States through a government agency and are currently rated AAA by at least one bond credit rating agency. The unrealized losses on these debt securities relate principally to the changes in market interest rates in the financial markets and are not as a result of projected shortfall of cash flows.

The Bank has incorporated an internal asset classification system, consistent with Federal banking regulations, as a part of the credit monitoring system. Management currently classifies problem and potential problem assets as special mention, substandard, doubtful or loss assets. An asset is considered substandard if it is inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. Substandard assets include those characterized by the distinct possibility that the insured institution will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. Assets classified as doubtful have all of the weaknesses inherent in those classified substandard with the added characteristic that the weaknesses present make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, highly questionable and improbable. Assets classified as loss are those considered uncollectible and of such little value that their continuance as assets without the establishment of a specific loss reserve is not warranted. Assets which do not currently expose the insured institution to sufficient risk to warrant classification in one of the aforementioned categories but possess weaknesses are required to be designated special mention. The following tables present the classes of the loan portfolio in which a formal risk weighting system is utilized summarized by the aggregate Pass and the criticized category of special mention , and the classified categories of

The allowance for loan losses is established through a provision for loan losses charged to expense. Management maintains the allowance at a level believed to cover all known and inherent losses in the portfolio that are both probable and reasonable to estimate at each reporting date. Management reviews the allowance for loan losses no less than quarterly in order to identify those inherent losses and to assess the overall collection probability for the loan portfolio in view of these inherent losses. For each primary type of loan, a loss factor is established reflecting an estimate of the known and inherent losses in such loan type using both a quantitative analysis as well as consideration of qualitative factors. The evaluation process includes, among other things, an analysis of delinquency trends, nonperforming loan trends, the level of charge-offs and recoveries, prior loss experience, total loans outstanding, the volume of loan originations, the type, size and geographic concentration of our loans, the value of collateral securing the loans, the borrowers ability to repay and repayment performance, the number of loans requiring heightened management oversight, local economic conditions and industry experience. Commercial real estate loans entail significant additional credit risks compared to one-to-four family residential mortgage loans, as they generally involve large loan balances concentrated with single borrowers or groups of related borrowers. In addition, the payment experience on loans secured by income-producing properties typically depends on the successful operation of the related real estate project and/or business of the borrower who is also the primary occupant, and thus may be subject to a greater extent to the effects of adverse conditions in the real estate market and in the economy in general. Commercial business loans typically involve a higher risk of default than residential loans of like duration since their repayment is generally dependent on the successful operation of the borrower s business and the sufficiency of

The increase in provision expense for fiscal year ended September 30, 2020 was primarily applicable to the uncertainties surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic. The increase in provision expense for fiscal year ended September 30, 2019 applicable to the increase in construction and land development was due to the increase in the portfolio, while the provision credit for the one to four family residential loans decreased due to the decrease in the portfolio. Loans acquired in the merger with Polonia Bancorp were recorded at fair value with no carryover of the related allowance for loan losses. Management measured loan fair values based on loan file reviews, appraised collateral values, expected cash flows, and historical loss factors of Polonia Bank. The fair value of the loans acquired was million net of a million discount of which million of the discount remained as of September 30, 2021. The discount is

 , million and for the years ended September 30, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The provision for loan losses was deemed necessary for fiscal 2021 primarily to maintain the allowance at a level sufficient to cover all inherent and probable losses in the current portfolio. Minimal delinquencies have occurred as of September 30, 2021 due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. There were no loan deferments outstanding as of September 30, 2021 and all previously existing COVID-19 deferrals had ended by September 30, 2020. participation interests in commercial real estate loans aggregating million, or of total loans, each entered into a subsequent deferral period during October 2020 and returned to normal payment status upon expiration of the deferral period. These deferments were not considered to be TDRs as of September 30, 2020 as all applicable borrowers were current as of December 31, 2019 and the request for the deferments were related to the current economic conditions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, and not by underlying weaknesses within the respective loans. The Company believes that the allowance for loan losses at September 30, 2021 was sufficient to cover all inherent and probable losses associated with the loan portfolio at such date. At September 30, 2021, the Company s non-performing assets totaled million or of total assets as compared to million or of total assets at September 30, 2020. Non-performing assets at September 30, 2021 included construction loans aggregating million, one-to-four family residential loans aggregating million, commercial real estate loans aggregating million and construction loans aggregating million that were foreclosed during the third quarter of fiscal 2021 and are held as other real estate owned. At September 30, 2021, the Company had loans totaling million that were classified as troubled debt restructurings TDRs ). TDR is on non-accrual and consists of a loan secured by a single-family residential property and is performing in accordance with the restructured terms. The remaining TDR is a commercial real estate loan classified as non-accrual and is part of a lending relationship totaling million (after taking into account the previously disclosed million write-down recognized during the quarter ending March 31, 2017 related to this borrowing relationship and the construction loans noted above that became other real estate owned during fiscal 2021). The primary project of the borrower (the development of a 169-unit townhouse project in Bristol Borough, Pennsylvania) is the subject of litigation between the Bank and the borrower. As previously disclosed, subsequent to the commencement of the litigation, the borrower filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 11 (Reorganization) of the federal bankruptcy code in June 2017. The Bank has moved the underlying litigation noted above with the borrower and the Bank from state court to the federal bankruptcy court in which the bankruptcy proceeding is being heard. The state litigation is stayed pending the resolution of the bankruptcy proceedings. As of September 30, 2021, units have been sold in the project resulting in being applied against the outstanding debt owed the Bank. Management will continue to monitor and modify the allowance for loan losses as conditions dictate. No assurances can be given that the level of the allowance for loan losses will cover all of the inherent losses on the loans or that future adjustments to the allowance for loan losses will not be necessary if economic and other conditions differ substantially from the economic and other conditions used by management to determine, in part, the current level of the allowance for loan losses. There were TDRs approved in 2021, 2020 or 2019. All of the existing TDRs involved changes in the interest rates on the loans; no debt was forgiven.

 State and political subdivisions Mortgage-backed securities - U.S. Government agencies Corporate bonds Equity security - FHLMC preferred stock Total Liabilities: Interest rate swap contracts Total Certain assets are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis; that is, the instruments are not measured at fair value on an ongoing basis but are subject to fair value adjustments in certain circumstances (for example, when there is evidence of impairment). The Company measures impaired loans and real estate owned at fair value on a non-recurring basis. Investments and Mortgage-Backed Securities The fair value of investment and mortgage-backed securities is based on quoted market prices, dealer quotes, and prices obtained from independent pricing services. Collateral dependent impaired loans are based on the fair value of the collateral which is based on appraisals and would be categorized as Level 2 measurement. In some cases, adjustments are made to the appraised values for various factors including the age of the appraisal, age of the comparable included in the appraisal, and known changes in the market and in the collateral. These adjustments are based upon unobservable inputs, and therefore, the fair value measurement of these assets has been categorized as a Level 3 measurement. These loans are reviewed for impairment and written down to their net realizable value by charges against the allowance for loan losses. The collateral underlying these loans had a fair value of million and million at September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Real Estate Owned Once an asset is determined to be uncollectible, the underlying collateral is generally repossessed and reclassified to foreclosed real estate and repossessed assets. These repossessed assets are carried at the lower of cost or fair value of the collateral, based on independent appraisals, less cost to sell and would be categorized as Level 3 measurement. In some cases, adjustments are made to the appraised values for various factors including the age of the appraisal, the age of the comparables included in the appraisal, and known changes in the market and in the collateral. Thus the evaluations are based upon unobservable inputs, and therefore, the fair value measurement of these assets has been categorized as a Level 3 measurement.

 Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements With Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure Not Applicable. Item 9A. Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures . Management evaluated, with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) as of September 30, 2021. Based on such evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and regulations and are operating in an effective manner. Management s Report of Internal Control over Financial Reporting . Management is responsible for designing, implementing, documenting, and maintaining an adequate system of internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. An adequate system of internal control over financial reporting encompasses the processes and procedures that have been established by management to: maintain records that accurately reflect the Company s transactions; prepare financial statement and footnote disclosures in accordance with U.S. GAAP that can be relied upon by external users; and prevent and detect unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 Management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on this evaluation under the criteria in Internal Control-Integrated Framework, management concluded that internal control over financial reporting was effective as of September 30, 2021. Furthermore, during the conduct of its assessment, management identified no material weakness in its financial reporting control system. The Board of Directors of Prudential Bancorp, through its Audit Committee, provides oversight to management s conduct of the financial reporting process. The Audit Committee, which is composed entirely of independent directors, is also responsible for the appointment of the independent registered public accounting firm. The Audit Committee also meets with management, the internal audit staff, and the independent registered public accounting firm throughout the year to provide assurance as to the adequacy of the financial reporting process and to monitor the overall scope of the work performed by the internal audit staff and the independent public accountants. Because of its inherent limitations, the disclosure controls and procedures may not prevent or detect misstatements. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can only provide reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
