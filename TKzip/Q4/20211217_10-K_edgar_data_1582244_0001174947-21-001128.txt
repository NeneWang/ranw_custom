PART I 

ITEM 1 BUSINESS 

General 

The Holding Company was incorporated in New York in
July 2013 to serve as a holding company for the Gas Company and its dormant subsidiary Corning Natural Gas Appliance Corporation (the
 Appliance Company ), Pike, Leatherstocking Gas Company, LLC, and Leatherstocking Pipeline Company, LLC. The Holding Company
also owns 50 of Leatherstocking Gas of New York, Inc. Leatherstocking NY ). As used in this document, the term the
Company refers to the consolidated operations of the Holding Company, Gas Company, Pike and (from July 1, 2020) the Leatherstocking
Companies. 

The Company s principal executive offices are
located at 330 W. William Street, Corning New York, 14830, the telephone number is (607) 936-3755, and our website is www.corninggas.com. 

Business 

The Company s primary business, through its
subsidiaries Corning Gas, Pike and the Leatherstocking Companies, is natural gas and electric distribution. Corning Gas serves approximately
15,000 residential, commercial, industrial and municipal customers in the Corning, Hammondsport and Virgil, New York, areas and two other
gas utilities which serve the Elmira and Bath, New York areas. It is franchised to supply gas service in all the political subdivisions
in which it operates. The Gas Company is under the jurisdiction of the New York Public Service Commission NYPSC which
oversees and sets rates for New York gas distribution companies. In addition, the Gas Company has contracts with Corning Incorporated
and Woodhull Municipal Gas Company, a small local utility, to provide maintenance service on their gas lines. Pike is an electric and
gas utility regulated by the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission PAPUC ). Pike provides electric service to approximately
4,900 customers in the Townships of Westfall, Milford, the northern part of Dingman, and in the Boroughs of Milford and Matamoras. Pike
provides natural gas service to 1,300 customers in Westfall Township and the Borough of Matamoras. All these communities are located in
Pike County, Pennsylvania. Additionally, Leatherstocking Gas is also regulated by the PAPUC and distributes gas in Susquehanna and Bradford
Counties, Pennsylvania. Leatherstocking Pipeline, an unregulated company, has served one customer in Lawton, Pennsylvania and has had
no revenues since 2018. Leatherstocking NY has an application pending before the NYPSC for authority to provide gas distribution services
in Broome County, New York. 

Pending Merger 

On January 12, 2021, Holding Company entered into
an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the Merger Agreement by and among Holding Company, affiliates of Argo Infrastructure partners,
LP named ACP Crotona Corp. Parent ), and ACP Crotona Merger Sub Corp. Merger Sub ), pursuant to which Merger
Sub will merge with and into Holding Company, and Holding Company will continue as the surviving corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary
of Parent (the Merger or the Argo Merger ). As a result of the Merger, shareholders of Holding Company will

preferred stock. Amounts payable to all shareholders will include cash for any unpaid dividends.

The Merger is subject to, among other customary
closing conditions, the approvals of the NYPSC and the PAPUC. In addition, the Merger requires the approval of the Company s shareholders
and the expiration of any applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvement Act. The Merger Agreement also includes
certain termination rights for both the Company and Parent and provides that, in connection with the termination of the Merger Agreement
under specified circumstances, termination fees may be owed by the Company to Parent, depending on the circumstances surrounding a termination. 

 The Merger Agreement provided for a 45-day Go
Shop period which expired on February 26, 2021. During the Go Shop period, the Company received no competing offers
or alternative acquisition proposals. The Company is now subject to a customary No Shop provision that restricts the Company s
ability to solicit acquisition proposals from third parties and to provide non-public information and to negotiate with third parties
regarding unsolicited acquisition proposals that is reasonably expected to lead to a superior proposal. On April 30, 2021, the Company
and Argo filed with the NYPSC and PAPUC joint petitions requesting approval to conclude the merger. Decisions from the commissions on
the merger petitions are not expected until the first half of 2022. The Merger was voted on and approved by the Company s shareholders
at its annual shareholder meeting on May 27, 2021. 

In connection with the execution of the Merger Agreement,
the Company has suspended its dividend reinvestment plan. 

Upon consummation of the Merger, the Company s
common stock will be delisted from the OTCQX and deregistered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange
Act as soon as practicable. 

Gas and Electric Supply 

Corning Gas has contracted with various sources to
provide natural gas to our distribution system. The Gas Company contracts for pipeline capacity, as well as storage capacity of approximately
736,000 dekatherms Dth ). The Company manages its transportation and storage capacity with internal resources. Pike has
contracted with Orange and Rockland Utilities, Inc. O R to provide electricity and natural gas according to agreements
until August 2022, subject to renewal. Leatherstocking Gas has a supply agreement with Cabot Oil and Gas that expires in August of 2026. 

Corning Gas secured the NYPSC-required fixed price
and storage gas supply for the 2021-2022 winter season and is managing its storage and gas supply contracts following its gas supply and
acquisition plan. Assuming no extraordinary conditions for the winter season, gas supply, flowing and storage will be adequate to serve
its customers. 

Corning Gas does not expect a shortage of natural
gas to impact our business over the next five to ten years. Natural gas supply over the last several years has been positive, and domestic
reserves and production have increased. This is especially true in proximity to our distribution network. We likewise anticipate no shortages
of the necessary pipes and valves for safe distribution of natural gas and continue to receive material inventory from various reliable
sources. We also have confidence that our agreement with O R will enable Pike to meet all our electric and gas needs for Pike s
customers and that Cabot Oil and Gas will be able to continue reliably supplying Leatherstocking Gas. 

Seasonality 

The Company s business is seasonal in nature,
and sales for each quarter of the year vary and are not comparable. Sales vary depending on seasonal variations in temperature. Gas sales
peak in the winter, while Pike s electric sales peak in the summer. 

Significant Customers 

The Gas Company has three major customers, Corning
Incorporated, New York State Electric Gas, and Bath Electric, Gas Water Systems. In total, these customers accounted for approximately
14.98 of the Gas Company s revenues in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021 FY 2021 and 14.32 in the fiscal
year ended September 30, 2020 FY 2020 ). The loss of any of these customers would have an adverse impact on our financial
results. 

Human Capital 

The Company had 73 employees as of September 30, 2021,
and 72 as of September 30, 2020. Of this total, approximately one third are union labor working under a union contract effective until
April 3, 2023. Our people work primarily at three business locations in New York and Pennsylvania. The Company offers its employees competitive
salaries and wages, excellent health and welfare benefit plans, including a 401(k) plan with a company match, and at the Gas Company,
a qualified defined benefit pension plan. Our employees enjoy eleven paid holidays, paid vacation and personal days, paid sick leave,
and Company sponsored group term life insurance benefits. 

We offer employee training programs that enable our
employees to obtain and maintain industry certifications required to assist customers with gas and electric service issues. We promote
safety in the workplace by requiring our people to receive training on sexual

harassment in the workplace, alcohol and substance
abuse, and we offer free training on interpersonal skills. We also offer our employees access to professional counseling to help them
deal with personal and family issues. 

Competition 

Historically, the competition in the Gas Company s
residential market and Pike s and Leatherstocking Gas s gas franchise territories has been primarily from electricity for
water heating and clothes drying, and to a small degree, fuel oil and propane for heating. The price of gas remains low in comparison
to that of alternative fuels in our service territories and our competitive position in the residential, commercial and industrial markets
continues to be strong. When we expand our distribution system to attract new customers, our principal competition is oil and propane.
Natural gas enjoys a price advantage over these fuels today. Pike electric has not faced significant competition to date. Although not
material today, we could experience competition from customer owned solar in the future. 

Environmental Regulation 

We believe we are in compliance with present federal,
state and local provisions relating to the protection of the environment. We do not expect that continued compliance with these requirements
will have any material adverse effect on our capital expenditures, earnings and financial position. The Company has no former manufactured
gas plant sites (MGP) and is not a party to any environmental proceedings, litigation or complaints. 

Regulatory Matters 

On May 19, 2021, the NYPSC issued a rate order establishing
rates and a rate plan for the Gas Company for a one-year period ending January 31, 2022. The rate order reduced customer rates by 766,000,
but it eliminated a 1.3 million tax sur-credit related to income tax rate reductions in the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The rate order
was retroactive to February 1, 2021. 

On July 16, 2021, the Gas Company filed a three-year
rate plan with the NYPSC for rate years ending on June 30, 2023, 2024, and 2025. The rate increases requested for the three-year rate
plan are 6,555,000, 1,030,000, and 843,000, respectively. 

On June 25, 2021, the PAPUC issued a rate order approving
Pike s gas rate increase of 225,000 per year, and on July 15, 2021, the PAPUC issued a rate order approving an electric rate increase
in the amount of 1.4 million per year. Both rate increases took effect on July 28, 2021.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 

 Failure to consummate the Argo Merger 

 The Argo Merger is subject to approval by, among
others, both the New York and Pennsylvania public utility commissions, and the United States Justice Department. In the event that regulators
fail to approve the Merger, the Company could experience difficulty in obtaining financing for capital projects required by its regulators,
and the Company would realize a significant cash loss related to costs incurred in pursuit of the merger transaction. 

 Our operations could be adversely affected
by fluctuations in the price of natural gas and electricity. 

 Prices for natural gas and electricity are subject
to volatile fluctuations in response to changes in supply and other market conditions. While these costs are usually passed on to customers
of the Gas Company pursuant to natural gas adjustment clauses, and to customers of Pike and Leatherstocking Gas through the gas rate cost,
and therefore do not pose a direct risk to earnings, we are unable to predict what effect a sharp increase in natural gas and electricity
prices may have on our customers energy consumption or ability to pay. Higher prices to customers can lead to higher bad debt expense
and customer conservation. Higher prices may also have an adverse effect on our cash flow as we are typically required to pay for our
natural gas and electricity prior to receiving payments for the natural gas or electricity from our customers. 

 Operational issues beyond our control could
have an adverse effect on our business. 

7 

 Table of Contents 

Pike, Leatherstocking Gas, and the Gas Company s
ability to provide natural gas and electricity depends both on our own operations and facilities and that of third parties, including
local gas producers, natural gas pipeline operators, and our electric supplier from whom we receive our natural gas and electric supplies.
The loss of use or destruction of our facilities or the facilities of third parties due to extreme weather conditions, breakdowns, war,
acts of terrorism or other occurrences could greatly reduce potential earnings and cash flows and increase our costs of repairs and replacement
of assets. Although we carry property insurance to protect our assets, and regulatory policies of the NYPSC and PAPUC provide the opportunity
for deferral and recovery of extraordinary incremental costs associated with losses for such incidents, our losses may not be fully recoverable
through insurance or customer rates. Additionally, the effect of the coronavirus pandemic could adversely affect our ability to maintain
our gas and electric distribution systems and serve our customer base. 

 Environmental regulations can significantly
affect the Company s business. 

 The Company s business operations are subject
to federal, state, and local laws and regulations relating to environmental protection. Costs of compliance and liabilities could negatively
affect the Company s results. In addition, compliance with environmental laws, regulations or permit conditions could require unexpected
capital expenditures at the Company s facilities. Because the costs of such compliance could be significant, additional regulation
could negatively affect the Company s business. Climate change, and the regulatory and legislative developments related to climate
change, may adversely affect operations and financial results. If there were to be any impacts from climate change to the Company s
operations and financial results, the Company expects that they would likely occur over a long period of time and thus are difficult to
quantify with any degree of specificity. Extreme weather events may result in adverse physical effects on portions of the Company s
gas and electric infrastructure, which could disrupt the Company s supply chain, and ultimately its operations. Disruption of transportation
and distribution systems activities could result in reduced operational efficiency, and customer service interruption. Climate change,
and the laws, regulations and other initiatives to address climate change, may impact the Company s financial results. Federal,
state and local legislative and regulatory initiatives proposed or adopted in recent years in an attempt to limit the effects of climate
change, including greenhouse gas emissions, could have significant impacts on the energy industry including government-imposed limitations,
prohibitions or moratoriums on the use of gas. A number of states have adopted energy strategies or plans with goals that include the
reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. New York passed the Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act CLCPA ), which
created emission reduction and electric generation mandates, and could ultimately impact the Company s customer base. Legislation
or regulation that aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions could also include greenhouse gas emissions limits and reporting requirements,
carbon taxes, restrictive permitting, increased efficiency standards, and incentives or mandates to conserve energy, or to use renewable
energy sources. Additionally, the trend toward increased conservation, competition from renewable energy sources, and technological advances
to address climate change may reduce the demand for natural gas and electricity. For further discussion of the risks associated with environmental
regulation to address climate change, refer Management s Discussion and
Analysis under the heading Environmental Matters . 

 Significantly warmer than normal weather
conditions may affect the sale of natural gas and significantly cooler than normal weather could affect our electric sales. Either could
adversely impact our financial position and the results of our operations. 

 The demand for natural gas and electricity are
directly affected by weather conditions. Significantly warmer than normal weather conditions in the winter in our service areas could
reduce our earnings and cash flows as a result of lower gas sales. Cooler summer weather would result in lower electricity sales for air
conditioning. Corning Gas mitigates the risk of warmer winter weather through the weather normalization and revenue decoupling clauses
in our tariffs. These clauses allow the Gas Company to surcharge customers for under-recovery of revenue. Pike and Leatherstocking Gas
do not have weather normalization or revenue decoupling to mitigate the risk of warmer weather in the winter or cooler weather in the
summer. 

 Information Technology 

 Cyber-attacks or acts of cyber-terrorism could
disrupt our business operations and information technology systems or result in the loss or exposure of confidential or sensitive customer,
employee or Company information. In FY 2020, the Company experienced cyber-attacks that were intended to extract ransom payments. The
attacks were resolved without paying a ransom and did not result in the loss of data or an interruption of customer service. Since the
attacks, the Company has taken steps to harden its defenses against future attacks. 

 There are inherent risks associated with
storing and transporting natural gas and distribution of electricity, which could cause us to incur significant financial losses. 

 There are inherent hazards and operation risks in
gas transportation and distribution activities, such as leaks, accidental explosions and mechanical problems that could cause substantial
financial losses. There are also risks associated with the distribution of electricity. These risks could, if they occur, result in the
loss of human life, significant damage to property, environmental pollution, impairment of operations and substantial losses. The location
of pipelines, storage facilities and electric distribution near populated areas, including 

8 

 Table of Contents 

residential areas, commercial business centers and
industrial sites, could increase the level of damages resulting from these risks. These activities may subject us to litigation and administrative
proceedings that could result in substantial monetary judgments, fines or penalties. To the extent that the occurrence of any of these
events is not fully covered by insurance, they could adversely affect our financial position and results of operations. 

 Changes in regional economic conditions
could reduce the demand for natural gas and electricity. 

 The Gas Company s business follows the economic
cycle of the customers in our service regions: Corning, Bath, Virgil, Elmira, and Hammondsport, New York. A falling, slow or sluggish
economy that would reduce the demand for natural gas in the areas in which we are doing business by forcing temporary plant shutdowns,
closing operations or slow economic growth would reduce our earnings potential. Pike and Leatherstocking Gas are less likely to be affected
by a sluggish economy as they presently have no large industrial customers. 

Many of our commercial and industrial gas customers
use natural gas in the production of their products. During economic downturns, these customers may see a decrease in demand for
their products, which in turn may lead to a decrease in the amount of natural gas they require for production. During any economic slowdown,
there is typically an increase in individual and corporate customer bankruptcies. Pike and Leatherstocking Gas have limited industrial
customers and are therefore less vulnerable to economic conditions in their service territories. An increase in customer bankruptcies
would increase our bad debt expenses and reduce our cash flows. 

Our earnings may decrease in the event of adverse
regulatory actions. 

Most of our operations are subject to the jurisdiction
of the NYPSC or the PAPUC. The NYPSC and PAPUC approve the rates that we may charge to our customers. If we are required in a rate proceeding
to reduce the rates we charge our customers, or if we are unable to obtain approval for rate relief, particularly when necessary to cover
increased costs, including costs that may be incurred in connection with mandated infrastructure improvements, our earnings would decrease. 

Our success depends in large part upon the continued
services of a number of significant employees, the loss of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results
of operation. 

Our success depends in large part upon the continued
services of our senior executives and other key employees. Although we have entered into an employment agreement with Michael I. German,
our president and chief executive officer, he can terminate his agreement on ninety days notice. Other significant officers may
terminate their employment at any time. The loss of the services of any significant employee could have a material adverse effect on our
business. 

Concentration of share ownership among our largest
shareholders may prevent other shareholders from influencing significant corporate decisions. 

The four largest holders of our common stock own approximately
52 of the outstanding common stock. As a result, if any chose to act together, they would have the ability to exert substantial influence
over all matters requiring approval by our shareholders, including the election and removal of directors, any proposed merger, consolidation
or sale of all or substantially all of our assets and other corporate transactions. This concentration of ownership could be disadvantageous
to other shareholders with differing interests from these shareholders. 

Our cash flows from operations may not be sufficient
to fund our capital expenditures. 

Our cash flows from operations are largely dependent
on allowed revenues subject to the approval of the NYPSC and PAPUC, and may not be sufficient to meet all of our cash needs. The
Company has a pending rate case before the NYPSC, the outcomes of which is uncertain. We estimate capital expenditures in fiscal 2022
for the Gas Company, Pike, and Leatherstocking Gas to be 7.0 million, 3.3 million and 0.94 million, respectively. If cash flows from
operations are not sufficient to fund these capital expenditures, we will need to rely on new debt or equity financing which may be difficult
to obtain. 

We will require additional financing which may
be difficult or costly to obtain. 

In order to fund our capital expenditures, we may
need to obtain additional debt and/or equity financing. The incurrence of debt would result in increased debt service obligations and
could result in operating and financing covenants that would restrict our operations. Additional financing for the Gas Company requires
NYPSC approval, and for Pike and Leatherstocking Gas requires PAPUC approval. Additional financing may have unacceptable terms or may
not be available at all for various reasons including:

If we cannot raise additional capital on acceptable
terms, we may not be able to finance the expansion and mandated upgrading of our distribution system, take advantage of future opportunities
or respond to competitive pressures, or respond to unanticipated capital requirements. 

 The Company s profitability may be
adversely affected by increased competition. 

 Corning Gas is in a geographical area with a number
of interstate pipelines and local production sources. If a major customer decided to connect directly to either an interstate pipeline
or a local producer, our earnings and revenues would decrease. At Pike, electric customers could construct solar facilities at their homes
or businesses reducing electric demand. 

 The Companies face risks related to health
epidemics and other outbreaks, including the COVID-19 pandemic. 

 The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted, and continues
to impact, countries, communities, supply chains and markets. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we may face an extended economic slowdown
in our service territories that could have a material impact on our liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations. 

 We will continue to monitor developments relating
to the COVID-19 pandemic; however, we cannot predict the extent to which COVID-19 may have a material impact on our business operations,
liquidity, financial condition, and financial results. The extent to which COVID-19 may impact these matters will depend on future developments
that are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information concerning the severity of COVID-19 and possible variants,
actions that federal, state and local governmental or regulatory agencies may take in response to COVID-19, and other actions taken to
contain it or treat its impact, among others.

ITEM 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION
AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Overview 

New York and Pennsylvania government authorities,
in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, imposed restrictions on social activities, closed schools and placed operating restrictions on commercial
operations in our franchise areas beginning in March of 2020. Many 

11 

 Table of Contents 

pandemic related restrictions have been lifted and
businesses have re-opened. The Company is now focused on completing work on inspecting and remediating interior property/customer services
that were restricted during the pandemic, most of which require work done on customer premises. Our customer service specialists are working
with customers to bring them current on their utility bills. We are assisting pandemic affected customers to access government funding
designed to help customers pay current and past due utility bills. The Company has limited service termination options in New York and
in Pennsylvania. The Company is still recovering from the impact of lost revenues, mostly from commercial customers, due to the pandemic. 

On May 19, 2021, the NYPSC issued a rate order (Case
20-G-0101) establishing rates and a rate plan for the Gas Company for a one year period ending January 31, 2022, denying the Gas Company s
request for a rate increase of approximately 6.2 million and instead ordered a base rate decrease of 766,000, offset by the termination
of an existing tax sur-credit customer refund of approximately 1.3 million, resulting in an overall rate increase of approximately 500,000.
The order was lower than the rate increase recommended by the NYPSC staff. The NYPSC cited pandemic austerity issues in support of its
order. The Gas Company is appealing this order under Article 78 of the Civil Practice Law and Rules asking the New York Supreme Court
to set aside the order and to remand the case to the NYPSC for further proceedings. In addition, on July 16, 2021, the Gas Company filed
a three year rate plan with the NYPSC seeking levelized rate increases of approximately 3,761,000 per year. The results in Case 20-G-0101
adversely impacted the Company s earnings for fiscal 2021. 

In June and July of 2021, the PAPUC issued rate orders
approving Pike gas rate increases of 225,000 and electric rate increases of 1.4 million, beginning on July 28, 2021. These rate increases
occurred late in the Company s fiscal year and did not materially impact our financial results for fiscal 2021. 

We believe our key performance indicators are net
income, stockholders equity and the safety and reliability of our systems. Net income decreased by 1,676,455 for FY 2021 compared
to FY 2020. Because the Holding Company s principal operations are conducted through Corning Gas and Pike, both regulated utility
companies, stockholders equity is an important performance indicator. The NYPSC and PAPUC allow the Company the opportunity to
earn a just and reasonable return on stockholders equity as determined under applicable regulations. Stockholders equity
is, therefore, a precursor of future earnings potential. As of September 30, 2021, compared to September 30, 2020, stockholders 
equity decreased slightly from 35,933,515 to 35,472,550. We plan to continue our focus on building stockholders equity. Safety
and efficiency indicators include leak repair, main and service replacements and customer service metrics. 

For FY 2021, our net income decreased due to transaction
costs associated with the pending Argo merger, higher depreciation expense, increased interest expense, increased operating costs, and
non-recurring income items recognized in FY 2020, partially offset by the forgiveness of our Paycheck Protection Program loans in the
third quarter of FY 2021. We continue to focus on improving the efficiency of our operations and making capital investments to improve
our infrastructure. Corning Gas s infrastructure improvement program concentrates on the replacement of older distribution mains
and customer service lines. In FY 2021 the Gas Company repaired 110 leaks, replaced 9.0 miles of bare steel main and replaced 176 bare
steel services. In FY 2020 the Gas Company repaired 184 leaks, replaced 8.6 miles of bare steel main and replaced 229 bare steel services.
Pike replaced approximately 82 utility poles in FY 2021, 150 utility poles in FY 2020, and did extensive tree trimming to maintain our
electric infrastructure. On January 18, 2019 Pike filed a Long-Term Infrastructure Improvement Plan LTIIP to accelerate
replacement of cast iron, wrought iron and bare steel pipe over 11 years. The PAPUC approved the LTIIP plan on June 13, 2019.

Gas Revenue and Margin 

Gas retail operating revenues increased 1,317,197,
during FY 2021 compared to FY 2020. Gas costs increased 0.25 per one thousand cubic feet (Mcf) year over year. The higher gas costs increased
revenues by 464,385. Firm sales increased by 299,998.6 Mcf which resulted in higher gas cost revenues of 929,681, However, this increase
was offset by a Corning Gas rate decrease net of the pass back to customers for the federal income tax benefit related to the 2017 Tax
Act amounting to a net decrease of 76,869. Purchased gas costs are subject to a NYPSC approved reconciliation that permits recovery of
all prudently incurred costs. Therefore, the higher gas cost revenues does not impact net income.

Gas purchases are our largest expenses. Purchased
gas expense increased 1,158,756 for FY 2021 compared to FY 2020. The increase in costs is due primarily to higher gas costs of 338,655
and increased fuel deferral of 792,104, offset by a decrease in prior period customer pass back of 22,003. 

We anticipate that the cost of natural gas is likely
to increase in the near term due to the post pandemic demand for energy and current economic conditions. Increases in the cost of gas
should be tempered by our access to low cost local production gas. 

Gas Margin (the excess of utility gas revenues over
the cost of natural gas purchased) for FY 2021 was up 317,450 or approximately 1.60 . Gas margin percentage decreased 3.12 for FY 2021
compared to FY 2020. Gas revenues increased 5.82 and purchased gas expense increased 21.06 . The gas margin percentages were negatively
impacted by the higher gas costs of 1,158,756.

Utility electric retail operating revenues increased
 1,307,351 during FY 2021 compared to FY 2020. This increase was mainly attributable to increased purchased power costs of 954,392 and
increased customer usage of 352,959. The purchased electricity costs increased by 0.015 per Kilowatt hour when compared to FY 2020.
Purchased electricity costs are subject to a PAPUC approved reconciliation that permits recovery of all prudently incurred costs. Accordingly,
higher purchased electricity costs does not impact net income. 

Other electric revenues increased 66,103 during FY
2021 compared to FY 2020. The components of this increase are detailed in the tables below:

Electricity costs increased by 1,047,718 for FY 2021
compared to FY 2020. The increase in costs for FY 2021 is due primarily to an increase in the price of purchased electricity of 998,256
and increased fuel deferral of 49,493. 

The cost of electricity is likely to increase in the
near term as electricity prices generally follow the prices of natural gas. 

Electric Margin (the excess of electric revenues over
the cost) was up 325,736 for FY 2021 compared to FY 2020. Electric margin percentage decreased 8.74 for FY 2021 compared to FY 2020.
The electric margin was negatively impacted by the higher purchased power costs of 1,047,718.

Operating and Interest Expenses 

Operating and maintenance expense
for FY 2021 increased by 2,861,412 compared to FY 2020. The increase in expenses was due primarily to merger related costs of 667,585
additional expenses associated with 100 ownership of Leatherstocking Gas Company of 420,284, leak repair reserve write down of 174,773,
liability reserve of 490,052, insurance costs of 244,663, wages of 200,000, outside services of 370,598 and all other costs, including
pandemic related costs, in the amount of 293,457. 

Taxes other than income taxes increased
 51,698 for FY 2021 compared to FY 2020. The increase results from a property tax increase of 25,222 and gross receipts tax increase
of 37,680 net of decrease in payroll taxes of 11,204. 

Depreciation expense for FY 2021 compared
to FY 2020 increased by 717,384 primarily due to reduced depreciable lives of certain Pike assets from 11 years to 5 years, increased
depreciable utility plant placed in service, as well as a full year s depreciation expense for the Leatherstocking Companies. 

Interest expense for FY 2021 compared
to FY 2020 increased by 866,315 mainly due to additional interest costs associated with higher levels of outstanding debt attributed
to capital expenditures, the Leatherstocking acquisition, write down of fixed interest regulatory asset

in the amount of 231,000 and additional dividends
associated with outstandin g Preferred Series A and C shares which are recorded as interest expense. 

Effective Tax Rate 

Our effective income tax rate was
23.3 for FY 2021 and 23.1 for FY 2020. The increase in the effective tax rate was impacted by higher non deductible dividends on preferred
stock that are reflected as interest expense on our income statement, offset by the tax free forgiveness of our PPP loans. See Note 11
 Income Taxes in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. 

Paycheck Protection Program Loans 

On various dates in the second and
third quarters of FY 2021, the Company s Paycheck Protection Program Loans PPP loans were forgiven by the United
States Small Business Administration in the following amounts: 

Gas Company 

970,900 

Pike 

137,200 

Leatherstocking Gas 

64,691 

The Company recorded these debt forgiveness amounts
as other income in the quarters in which the loans were forgiven. In response to a NYPSC order to show cause as to why the Gas Company
loan forgiveness amount should not be refunded to its customers, in addition to responding to the show cause order, the Gas Company recorded
a reserve in the third quarter of FY 2021 for approximately 490,000. While this issue remains unresolved, NYPSC staff in its direct testimony
in Case 20-G-0394 recommended that the Company s reserve be refunded to customers over a five year amortization period beginning
in 2022. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Internally generated cash from operating activities
consists of net income, adjusted for non-cash expenses and changes in operating assets and liabilities. Non-cash items include depreciation
and amortization, gain or loss on sale of securities and deferred income taxes. Over or under recovered gas costs could significantly
impact cash flow. In addition, there are significant year-to-year changes in regulatory assets that impact cash flow. Cash flows used
in investing activities typically consist primarily of capital expenditures and investments in our joint ventures. For FY 2020 the acquisition
of our partner s 50 interests in the Leatherstocking Companies added approximately 1.9 million to cash used in investing activities.
We estimate capital expenditures to upgrade our distribution system of approximately 11.3 million in fiscal 2022. We expect to finance
these planned capital expenditures with a combination of cash provided by operations and issuance of additional long-term debt and equity. 

The earnings sharing mechanism approved by the NYPSC
in the June 2017 Order provided for sharing between Corning Gas stockholders and customers of the earned return on equity (ROE) above
certain levels. Under the earnings sharing mechanism, Corning Gas is allowed to retain all earnings up to and including a 9.5 ROE level,
50 of earnings above 9.5 up to and including 10 , 25 of earnings above 10 up to and including 10.5 , and 10.0 of earnings above 10.5 .
We believe that these limits do not have a significant effect on our liquidity because even at those limits we have sufficient cash collected
from our earnings to support operations. 

Cash flows from financing activities consist of dividends
paid, repayment of long-term debt, net proceeds from new debt, net proceeds from sales of preferred shares and changes in the outstanding
balances of our lines-of-credit. 

On September 30, 2021, we had approximately 52.6
million in long-term debt outstanding. We made principal payments on outstanding debt during FY 2021 consistent with the requirements
of our debt instruments and refinancing activities. 

On January 15, 2021, Corning Gas obtained a short
term loan from M T Bank in the amount of 850,000 to be used to finance merger transaction costs, and for general operating expenses
and working capital. The loan had an interest rate of 2.6 plus the one month LIBOR interest rate, with a combined floor of 3.1 . This
loan was repaid in full as part of the Gas Company s June 25, 2021 multiple disbursement term loan. 

On June 25, 2021, Corning Gas secured a 4.665 million
multiple disbursement term loan Term Loan from M T Bank. Corning Gas used 850,000 of the Term Loan to repay the January
15, 2021 M T Bank short term loan, and used the remainder of the loan proceeds for capital expenditures and pipeline repairs. The
Term Loan allowed for multiple draws until October 31, 2021, at which time the loan converted into a ten-year term loan. The Term loan
bore interest at a variable rate equal to 2.9 plus the one-month LIBOR rate, with a floor of 3.4 , converting into a 10 year term loan
at a variable interest rate.

On June 25, 2021, Corning Gas obtained a 1.9 million
bridge loan Bridge loan from M T Bank, the proceeds of which were used for general operating purposes, and to fund
merger related costs. The Bridge loan is a demand note that bears interest at a variable rate equal to 3.0 plus the one-month LIBOR rate,
with a 3.5 floor. 

On September 30, 2021, Corning Gas secured a 3 million
demand loan from M T Bank, the proceeds of which were used for working capital purposes. The demand loan bears interest at a variable
rate equal to 2.90 plus the greater of the applicable daily simple Secured Overnight Financing rate (SOFR) or 0.50 . 

On October 13, 2020, Pike secured a 1.315 million
multiple disbursement loan from M T Bank, the proceeds of which were used to fund capital construction projects. The loan allowed
for multiple draws until it converted into a 10 year long term loan at a fixed interest rate of 3.4 . The Holding Company guarantees the
Pike loan. 

On August 19, 2021, Pike obtained a 2.21 million
multiple disbursement loan Pike Loan from M T Bank. The Pike Loan was used for capital expenditures and for pipeline
repairs. The Pike Loan allowed for multiple draws until October 31, 2021, at which time the loan converted into a ten year term loan at
a variable interest rate. The Pike Loan bore interest at 2.9 plus the one month LIBOR rate with a floor of 3.4 . At October 31, 2021,
the Pike note converted into a ten year term loan at a variable interest rate. The Holding Company guarantees the Pike Loan. 

On February 12, 2021, Leatherstocking Gas obtained
an 800,000 multiple disbursement loan Leatherstocking Loan from Wayne Bank. The Leatherstocking Loan was used for capital
expenditures and for gas pipeline repairs. The Leatherstocking Loan converted into a ten year term loan on October 31, 2021, at a fixed
interest rate of 4.75 . The Holding Company guarantees the Leatherstocking Loan. 

Corning Gas, Pike and Leatherstocking Gas have revolving
lines of credit of 8.5 million, 2.0 million and 1.5 million, respectively. The Company primarily utilizes these lines of credit to
purchase gas and electricity. The Company believes these lines of credit are sufficient to fund our short term purchasing needs. 

The Gas Company is responsible for managing its gas
supply assets. At September 30, 2021, the Gas Company had 586,455 Dth at a cost of 1,366,341 in storage. We anticipate that the Gas Company
will have sufficient gas to supply our customers for the 2021-2022 winter heating season. The contract with O R should provide for
sufficient electricity and natural gas to supply Pike for the 2021-2022 winter heating and summer cooling demand. M T has issued to
O R a letter of credit in the amount of 1 million as security for the obligations of Pike under Pike s electric and the gas
supply and gas transportation agreement. The agreements provide for three years of electric and gas supply for the customers of Pike,
with up to three one-year extensions. Leatherstocking Gas purchases its gas from Cabot Oil on an as needed basis and therefore has no
gas in storage. We anticipate that Leatherstocking will have sufficient gas to supply its customers for the 2021-2022 winter heating season. 

As of September 30, 2021, we believe that cash flow
from operating activities and borrowings under our lines of credit will be sufficient to satisfy debt service requirements over the next
twelve months. We believe new debt and proceeds from equity will be required to satisfy our capital expenditures to finance our internal
growth needs for the next twelve months. 

Off Balance Sheet Arrangements 

We have no off balance sheet arrangements. 

Contractual Obligations 

The following tables summarize the Company s
expected future contractual cash obligations as of September 30, 2021, and the twelve-month periods over which they occur. 

The aggregate maturities of long-term debt for each of the five years subsequent to September
 30, 2021 are as follows:

The projected benefit obligation of the benefit
plan has been calculated based on the census and plan provisions, as well as a number of economic and demographic assumptions. The discount
rate for the period ending September 30, 2021 is 3.64 and is assumed to be the rate going forward. A decrease in the discount rate of
1 could increase the projected benefit obligation by 4.3 million and an increase in the discount rate of 1 could decrease the obligation
by 3.4 million. Either change would impact the estimated pension plan payment for future periods. 

 Regulatory Matters 

Holding Company 

The Holding Company s primary business, through
its subsidiaries Corning Gas, Pike, and Leatherstocking Gas, is regulated by the NYPSC and PAPUC, among other agencies. 

On April 30, 2021, the Company and Argo filed with
the NYPSC a Verified Joint Petition seeking approval, pursuant to Section 70 of the New York Public Service Law for its merger. This case
is pending approval by the Commission and there is no statutory timeline for the NYPSC to decide this matter. 

Also on April 30, 2021, the Company and Argo filed
with the PAPUC a Joint Application requesting certificates of public convenience from the PAPUC and seeking all other PAPUC approvals
necessary for the merger. This case is pending approval by the Commission and there is no statutory deadline for the PAPUC to decide this
matter. 

Gas Company 

 On August 9, 2018, The NYSPSC issued an order
in Case 17-M-0815 that required Corning Gas to return to customers the difference between the federal income tax allowance in base rates
and the new statutory rate of 21 under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the Tax Act ). The refund to customers began on
October 1, 2018. The customers experienced a decrease of 3.87 on their overall bill in the year starting October 1, 2018 and experienced
a decrease of 3.72 on their overall bill in the year starting October 1, 2019. The amount estimated to be returned to customers was 980,964
during FY 2019 and was 1,004,563 during FY 2020. These refunds will not impact the Gas Company s allowed earnings. The impact of
the change in the Tax Act on deferred regulatory balances was deferred until the Gas Company s base rate case (Case 20-G-0101).
The Gas Company has recorded those amounts as Regulatory Liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. The lower tax rate of 21 was
included in base rates in Case 20-G-0101 therefore the pass back to customers ceased on February 1, 2021. The impact of the change in
the Tax Act on deferred regulatory balances was reflected in customer rates in Case 20-G-0101 effective February 1, 2021. 

 On May 19, 2021, the NYPSC issued a rate order
in Case 20-G-0101, establishing rates and a rate plan for the Gas Company for a one-year period ending on January 31,2022 Rate
Year ). The rate order disallowed the Company s request for an increase in required revenue of 6,223,603, and instead ordered
a reduction of 766,000 from current rates. In the current rate order, the existing 1.3 million tax sur-credit (an adjustment to rates
to refund to customers an amount owing them due to income tax rate reductions in the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act) expired, along with a
 30,000 reduction to the annual Delivery Rate Adjustment. In addition, the NYPSC denied recovery of the Gas Company s approximately
 350,000 leak repair and survey cost reserve established in FY 2016. The denial of recovery of this reserve resulted in a FY 2021 charge
of approximately 180,000 (pre tax), as the Company had previously established a reserve for this matter in the amount of 170,000 (pre-tax).
The net impact on the Gas Company s customers was an increase of 505,000 for the Rate Year, retroactive to February 1, 2021.

The Gas Company, on July 15, 2021, filed a petition
with the State of New York Supreme Court in Albany County pursuant to Article 78 of the Civil Practice Law and Rules to review and set
aside the NYPSC May 19, 2021 Order that was issued in PSC cases 20-G-0101 and 16_G-0204 involving the Gas Company s rates for gas
service. The Gas Company s petition claims that the NYPSC s decision was arbitrary and capricious and an abuse of discretion,
affected by errors of law, and in violation of established regulatory procedure. The Gas Company s petition requests a judgment:
(1) annulling and setting aside the Order as arbitrary and capricious and an abuse of discretion, affected by errors of law, in violation
of lawful regulatory procedure, and unsupported by substantial evidence in the record, insofar as the Order implements four areas of austerity 
adjustments and denies recovery of leak survey and repair costs; (2) remanding this matter to the NYPSC for further proceedings consistent
with the Court s judgment; and (3) granting such other and further relief as may be just and proper. The resolution of this matter
is pending judicial review. 

 On July 16, 2021, the Gas Company filed a three-year
rate plan (Case 20-G-0394) with the NYPSC for rate years ending on June 30, 2023, 2024, and 2025. The rate increases requested for the
three year rate plan (as amended) are 6,555,000, 1,030,000, and 843,000, respectively. In its filing, the gas Company proposes a rate
plan with levelized increases over three years in the amount of 3,761,000 per year. These rates, if implemented, would impact customer
bills by 11.14 in each year. 

 In March of 2021, the NYPSC issued a Show
Cause order instructing Corning Gas to show cause why its PPP loan in the amount of 970,000 should not be refunded to its customers
if and when the loan is forgiven. On May 13, 2021, the Gas Company responded to the Show Cause order supporting its position
that it will use the PPP loan proceeds to fund COVID operating costs, lost commercial revenues, and customer bad debt increases. On May
21, 2021, the Corning Gas PPP loan was forgiven. This matter is pending with the NYPSC. The NYPSC Staff has filed testimony on November
12, 2021 in Case 20-G-0394 on how to resolve the issues raised in the NYPSC Show Cause order. The Company expects that the
issue will be adjudicated in the pending rate case. 

 By petition dated September 3, 2020 in Case 20-G-0442,
Corning Gas requested authority under Public Service Law Section 69 to issue approximately 29.5 million of long term debt through December
31, 2024. The proceeds are to be used principally to fund NYPSC mandated system safety and reliability measures, including replacement
of older pipe and regulator stations; and purchase equipment, computer software and other supplies as necessary to maintain the distribution
system. The NYPSC issued a financing order in April of 2021 permitting the Gas Company to issue long term debt in the amount of 19.1
million, along with certain reporting requirements. 

 Pike 

 The PAPUC issued an order in Case M-2018-2641242
that requires Pike to return to customers the difference between the federal income tax allowance in base rates and the new statutory
rate of 21 . Pike s electric customers received a refund of 73,923 or decrease of 0.67 on their overall bill effective October
1, 2018. No refunds were ordered for Pike s gas operation because amounts were not material. The impact of the change in the Tax
Act on deferred regulatory balances will be deferred until Pike s next base rate case. Pike has recorded those amounts as Regulatory
Liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. The lower tax rate of 21 , as well as deferred regulatory balances, was included in customer
rates in Case R-2020-302235. 

 On October 24, 2020, Pike filed separate rate
cases with the PAPUC for an increase in revenues for its electric services in the amount of 1,933,600 (Case R-2020-302235) and for an
increase in revenues for its gas services in the amount of 262,200 (Case R-2020-3022134). Pike s current rates have been in effect
since 2014. The rate increase would impact residential customer bills by 17.3 for electric customers, and by 19.7 for gas customers.
The base period (test year) for this filing is the 12 month period ended June 30, 2020. The filings with the PAPUC reflect returns on
equity of 9.75 and pro forma equity ratios of 48.3 for each case. The primary reasons for the requested rate increases are PAPUC mandated
initiatives including the replacement of gas distribution equipment, replacement of electric poles and wires, the recovery of deferred
storm related costs, new safety, training, and cyber security requirement, and increased employee health and welfare benefits costs. 

 On June 25, 2021, the PAPUC issued a rate order
approving a gas rate increase of 225,000 and on July 15, 2021, the PAPUC issued a rate order approving an electric rate increase in the
amount of 1.4 million. Both rate increases took effect on July 28, 2021. 

 On July 15, 2021, the PAPUC issued a securities
certificate authorizing Pike to borrow up to 8,973,695 in long term debt, commencing on the date of issuance of the securities certificate
through December 31, 2025. The securities certificate requires Pike to file notice of long term borrowings with the PAPUC within 60 days
of borrowings. 

 Leatherstocking
Gas 

On September 15, 2021, the PAPUC issued a securities
certificate to Leatherstocking Gas permitting Leatherstocking Gas to issue debt securities in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed
 5,348,850. The certificate was issued in order to allow Leatherstocking to 

18 

 Table of Contents 

restructure two existing long-term loans owed to Wayne
Bank. On October 5, 2021, Leatherstocking Gas and Wayne Bank restructured two promissory notes due in March and August of 2029, locking
in each loan s interest rate at its current interest rate of 4.75 for the remaining loan terms, and cancelling provisions calling
for a redetermination of the interest rate on the 5 th anniversary of the loans. The Holding Company provided a guarantee of
both restructured loans. Leatherstocking Gas provided notice of this debt restructuring on October 12, 2021. 

Environmental Matters 

The Company is subject to various federal, state and
local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment. The effect (material or not) on the Company of any new legislative
or regulatory measures will depend on the particular provisions that are ultimately adopted. Environmental regulation legislative and
regulatory measures to address climate change and greenhouse gas emissions are in various phases of discussion or implementation. Legislation
or regulation that aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions could also include greenhouse gas emissions limits and reporting requirements,
carbon taxes, restrictive permitting, increased efficiency standards, and incentives or mandates to conserve energy or use renewable energy
sources. Federal, state or local governments may provide tax advantages and other subsidies to support alternative energy sources, mandate
the use of specific fuels or technologies, or promote research into new technologies to reduce the cost and increase the scalability of
alternative energy sources. New York State, for example, passed the CLCPA that mandates reduced greenhouse gas emissions to 60 of 1990
levels by 2030, and 15 of 1990 levels by 2050, with the remaining emission reduction achieved by controlled offsets. The CLCPA also requires
electric generators to meet 70 of demand with renewable energy by 2030. These climate change and greenhouse gas initiatives could impact
the Company's customer base and assets depending on regulatory treatment afforded in the process. The initiatives could also increase
the Company s cost of environmental compliance by increasing reporting requirements and requiring the Company to replace all leak
prone pipe. They could also delay or otherwise negatively affect efforts to obtain permits and other regulatory approvals with regard
to existing and new facilities and impose additional monitoring and reporting requirements. Changing market conditions and new regulatory
requirements, as well as unanticipated or inconsistent application of existing laws and regulations by administrative agencies, make it
difficult to predict a long-term business impact across twenty or more years. 

Critical Accounting Policies 

 Our significant accounting policies are described
in the notes to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-K. The application of generally accepted accounting
principles involves certain assumptions, judgments and estimates that affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses.
Thus, the application of these principles can result in varying results from company to company. The principles and policies that most
significantly impact us are discussed below. 

 Accounting for Utility Revenue and Cost of Gas
Recognition 

 Corning Gas records revenues from residential
and commercial customers based on meters read on a cycle basis throughout each month, while certain large industrial and utility customers 
meters are read at the end of each month. Corning Gas does not accrue revenue for gas delivered but not yet billed, as the NYPSC requires
that such accounting be adopted during a rate proceeding, which we have not done. Currently Corning Gas does not anticipate adopting unbilled
revenue recognition nor does it believe it would have a material impact on financial results. Our tariffs contain mechanisms that provide
for the recovery of the cost of gas applicable to firm customers, which includes estimates. Under these mechanisms, we periodically adjust
rates to reflect increases and decreases in the cost of gas and electricity. Annually, we reconcile the difference between the total gas
costs collected from customers and the cost of gas. We defer any excess or deficiency and subsequently either recover it from, or refund
it to, customers over the following twelve-month period or possibly longer based on the amounts if the cost for gas significantly exceeds
the total gas costs collected from customers. Quarterly, we reconcile the difference between electric costs collected from customers and
the cost of electricity. The default service charges for electricity are adjusted every quarter. To the extent estimates are inaccurate,
a regulatory asset on the balance sheet is increased or decreased. Pike and Leatherstocking Gas read all meters at the end of the month
and therefore have no unbilled revenue. As gas and electricity are immediately available for use upon delivery to the customer, the gas
or electricity and its delivery are identifiable as a single performance obligation. The Company recognizes revenues as this performance
obligation is satisfied over time as the Company delivers, and its customers simultaneously receive and consume, the gas or electricity. 

 Accounting for Regulated Operations - Regulatory
Assets and Liabilities 

 Corning Gas is subject to regulation by NYPSC,
and Pike and Leatherstocking are subject to regulation by the PAPUC. We record the results of our regulated activities in accordance with
Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) ASC No. 980, which results in differences in the application of generally accepted accounting
principles between regulated and non-regulated businesses. ASC No. 980 requires the recording of regulatory assets and liabilities for
certain transactions that would have been treated as revenue and expense in 

19 

 Table of Contents 

non-regulated businesses. In certain circumstances,
FASB ASC No. 980 allows entities whose rates are determined by third-party regulators to defer costs as regulatory assets in the balance
sheet to the extent that the entity expects to recover these costs in future rates. Management believes that currently available facts
support the continued application of ASC No. 980 and that all regulatory assets and liabilities are recoverable or refundable through
the regulatory environment. 

 Accounting for Income Taxes 

The Holding Company uses the asset and liability method
to establish deferred tax assets and liabilities for the temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis
of the Holding Company s assets and liabilities at enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when such amounts are realized or
settled. Such deferred tax assets and liabilities will be adjusted for the effects of enacted changes in tax laws and rates. 

Accounting for Joint Ventures 

Investments in joint ventures have been recognized
in the consolidated financial statements using the equity method of accounting based on the guidelines established in FASB ASC 323. In
applying this guidance, the Holding Company recognizes investments in joint ventures as assets at cost. Investments fluctuate in future
periods based on the Holding Company s allocable share of earnings or losses from the joint ventures which is recognized through
earnings. 

Pension and Post-Retirement Benefits 

The amounts reported in our consolidated financial
statements related to pension and other post-retirement benefits are determined on an actuarial basis, which requires the use of many
assumptions in the calculation of such amounts. These assumptions include the discount rate, the expected return on plan assets, the rate
of compensation increase and, for other post-retirement benefits, the expected annual rate of increase in per capita cost of covered medical
and prescription benefits. Changes in actuarial assumptions and actuarial experience could have a material impact on the amount of our
pension and post-retirement benefit costs and funding requirements. In FY 2020, the mortality assumption was revised to the sex-distinct
Amount-Weighted Pri-2012 Mortality Tables for employees, healthy annuitants, and contingent survivors with mortality improvements projected
using Scale MP-2019 on a generational basis. The decrease in discount rate from 3.96 to 3.64 as of September 2020 increased the benefit
obligation. The net effect of changes to the assumptions and discount rate is an increase of approximately 1.6 million to the pension
benefit obligation. However, we expect to recover substantially all our net periodic pension and other post-retirement benefit costs attributed
to employees in accordance with NYPSC authorization. For financial reporting purposes, the difference between the amounts of such costs
as determined under applicable accounting principles is recorded as either a regulatory asset or liability. 

For FY 2021, the Pension Plan mortality assumption
was revised to the sex-distinct Amount-Weighted Pri-2012 Mortality Tables for employees, health annuitants, and contingent survivors with
mortality improvements projected using Scale MP-2020 on a generational basis. The discount rate remained at 3.64 as of September 30,
2021. The net effect of changes to the assumptions, demographics and plan experience is an increase of approximately 18,000 to the pension
benefit obligation. However, we expect to recover substantially all of our net periodic pension and other post-retirement benefit costs
attributed to employees in accordance with NYPSC authorization. For financial reporting purposes, the difference between the amounts of
such costs as determined under applicable accounting principles is recorded as a regulatory asset or a regulatory liability. 

In FY 2021, the Retiree Group Health Benefits Plan
mortality assumption was revised to the sex-distinct Headcount Weighted Pri-2012 Mortality Tables for employees, healthy annuitants, and
contingent survivors with mortality improvements projected using Scale MP-2020 on a generational basis. The discount rate increased from
2.21 to 2.53 as of September 2021 which resulted in a decrease in the benefit obligation. The net effect of changes to the assumptions,
demographics and plan experience is an increase of approximately 14,000 to the retiree group health benefit obligation. 

Preferred Stock and Temporary Equity 

The Holding Company classifies conditionally redeemable
convertible preferred shares, which includes preferred shares subject to redemption upon the occurrence of uncertain events not solely
within control of the Holding Company, as temporary equity in the mezzanine section of the consolidated balance sheets, in accordance
with the guidance enumerated in ASC No. 480 Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity . The Company also analyzes the embedded conversion
feature for bifurcation, based on whether the host instrument has more equity-like or debt-like characteristics. Dividends are recorded
as a reduction to retained earnings and issuance costs reduce the initial proceeds and are then accreted over the life of the instrument
to the redemption amount.

The Holding Company records mandatorily redeemable
stock as a liability in accordance with FASB ASC No. 480. Dividends are recorded as interest expense and issuance costs are treated the
same way as debt issuance costs.

stock. Our officers, directors, and greater than 10 shareholders are required by the SEC to furnish us with copies of all Section 16(a)

 Audit Committee Report 

 Our board of directors has a separately
designated standing audit committee. In accordance with its written charter, which was approved and adopted by our board, our audit committee
assists the board in fulfilling its responsibility of overseeing the quality and integrity of our accounting, auditing and financial reporting
practices. A copy of the audit committee charter is available on our website at www.CorningGas.com. The audit committee is directly responsible
for the appointment of our independent registered public accounting firm, currently Freed Maxick CPA s, P.C.( Freed Maxick ),
and is charged with reviewing and approving all services performed for us by Freed Maxick and for reviewing the firm s fees. The
audit committee reviews Freed Maxick s internal quality control procedures, reviews all relationships between Freed Maxick and the
Company and its subsidiaries in order to assess the firm s independence, and monitors compliance with our policy regarding non-audit
services, if any, rendered by Freed Maxick. In addition, the audit committee ensures the regular rotation of the lead audit partner and
concurring partner. The audit committee reviews management s programs to monitor compliance with our policies on business ethics
and risk management. 

 The audit committee is currently comprised
of Mr. Welch, the committee s chairman, Mr. Cook, Mr. William Mirabito and Mr. Williamson. Mr. Mirabito
is an officer, director, and shareholder of a company that has entered into a joint venture with the Company (Leatherstocking New York).
The committee met three times in the last fiscal year. Mr. Welch, Mr. Cook, Mr. Mirabito, and Mr. Williamson are independent
directors as defined in the New York Stock Exchange listing standards. In addition, each member of the audit committee is able
to read and understand financial statements, including balance sheets, income statements, and cash flow statements. Our board has determined
that Mr. Williamson meets the qualifications for designation as a financial expert as defined in SEC rules through his experience
as the chief executive officer of RGC Resources, Inc., a publicly-held company. The audit committee reviews and reassesses its charter
as needed from time to time and will obtain the approval of the board for any proposed changes to its charter. 

 Our audit committee oversees management s
implementation of internal controls and procedures for financial reporting which are designed to ensure the integrity and accuracy of
our financial statements and our ability to timely record, process, and report the information required for public disclosure. In fulfilling
its oversight responsibilities, the audit committee reviewed and discussed the financial statements with management and Freed Maxick.
The audit committee reviewed and discussed with Freed Maxick the audited financial statements of the Company for the years ended September
30, 2021 and 2020. The audit committee also discussed with Freed Maxick the matters required by AU Section 380, Communication with
Audit Committees . The audit committee reviewed with Freed Maxick, which is responsible for expressing an opinion on the conformity
of our audited financial statements with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, its judgment 

25 

 Table of Contents 

as to the quality, not just the acceptability,
of our accounting principles and other matters as are required to be discussed with the audit committee pursuant to generally accepted
auditing standards. 

 In discharging its oversight responsibility
as to the audit process, our audit committee obtained from Freed Maxick a formal written statement describing all relationships between
Fred Maxick and the Company that might bear on Freed Maxick s independence consistent with the requirements of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board, and discussed with Freed Maxick any relationships that may impact its objectivity and independence. In considering
Freed Maxick s independence, the audit committee also considered whether the non-audit services performed by Freed Maxick on our
behalf were compatible with maintaining the independence of Freed Maxick. 

 In reliance upon (1) the audit committee s
reviews and discussions with management and Freed Maxick, (2) management s assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control
over financial reporting, and (3) the receipt of an opinion from Freed Maxick dated December 17, 2021 stating that the Company s
financial statements for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021 are presented fairly, in all material respects, in conformity with U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles, the audit committee recommended to our board that these audited financial statements be included
in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021, for filing with the SEC.

Employment Agreements 

 Pursuant to his employment agreement dated
November 30, 2006, as amended effective December 31, 2008, Mr. German continued to serve as president and chief executive officer
of Corning Gas for 2021 under the automatic renewal provisions of his contract. The employment agreement provides for termination payments
to Mr. German as follows: 

If Mr. German terminates his employment for good reason (as defined in the employment agreement
 generally a decrease in title, position or responsibilities, a decrease in salary or bonus or a reduction in benefits), then he
 will receive compensation and benefits until the effective date of his termination, plus a severance package equal to his then current
 annual salary. 

If Mr. German s employment is terminated without cause (as defined in the employment
 agreement), then he will receive compensation and benefits until the effective date of his termination, plus a severance package equal
 to his then current annual salary. 

If Mr. German s employment is terminated for a change in control (as defined in the
 employment agreement), then he will receive compensation and benefits until the effective date of his termination, plus a severance package
 equal to three times his then current annual salary. 

The employment agreement also contains
standard confidentiality, non-competition and non-solicitation provisions for a period including Mr. German s employment and
the twelve months immediately following the date of the termination of his employment. 

 On April 17, 2012, Corning Gas entered
into change of control agreements with all executive officers other than Mr. German. None of our other executive officers have employment
agreements. 

 Change of Control Agreements 

 On April 27, 2017, we entered into change
of control agreements with Mr. Cook and Mr. Miller. On August 31, 2020, we entered into a change of control agreement with Mr. Lenns.
The Cook and Miller agreements terminate on the first to occur of: (i) termination of the executive s employment with the Company
prior to a change of control (as defined in the agreements); (ii) one year from the date of a change of control; or (iii)
May 1, 2022, but only if no change of control has occurred as of that date. The agreement with Mr. Lenns is identical to the agreements
with Messrs. Cook and Miller, except its termination date is October 1, 2025. 

 Under each agreement, upon termination
of the executive s employment with the Company within twelve months following a change of control, unless termination is because
of the executive s death, or by the Company for cause or disability (each as defined in the agreements)
or by the executive other than for good reason (as defined in the agreements), we will be required to pay to the executive
the following: (i) the executive s full salary through the date of termination and all other unpaid amounts to which the executive
is entitled as of the date of termination 

27 

 Table of Contents 

under any plan or other arrangement of
the Company, at the time such payments are due (and in any event within 90 days after the executive s separation of service from
the Company); and (ii) an amount equal to the executive s annualized includable compensation for the base period (within the meaning
of Section 280G of the tax code), subject to reduction if the payment is or will be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999
of the tax code, which payment must be made in a lump sum within 90 days after the executive s separation from service. 

 The executives are not required to mitigate
the amount of any payment under the change of control agreements by seeking employment or otherwise. We also agreed to pay to each of
the executives all legal fees and related expenses incurred by the executive in connection with enforcing the agreement, whether or not
the executive prevails (subject to certain conditions with respect to Mr. Cook). 

 Executive Employee Incentive Program 

 Each year, our board of directors approves
the performance goals and terms of an executive employee incentive program. The program is designed to attract and retain high caliber
executives who can optimize the Company s performance and to reward our executive officers for the achievement of annual corporate
and operational goals. Performance bonuses, if earned, are paid in cash during the first calendar quarter of the calendar year following
the calendar year for which performance was measured and are based upon the board s determination of the percentage of the goals
that were met. Eligible employees include each of our executive officers listed in the summary compensation table who are officers on
the date of payment of the awards, other than Mr. German. Awards under the program are at the discretion of our board and may be
modified or discontinued at any time. 

 Benefit Plans 

 We provide competitive welfare and retirement
benefits to our executive officers as an important element of their compensation packages. Our executives receive medical and dental coverage,
life insurance, disability coverage and other benefits on the same basis as our other employees. Our executives are also eligible to participate
in our employee savings and pension plans. 

 Corning Natural Gas Corporation Employees
Savings Plan . All employees of Corning Gas who work for more than 1,000 hours per year and who have completed one year of service
may enroll in the savings plan at the beginning of each calendar quarter. Under the savings plan, participants may contribute up to 50 
of their wages. Corning Gas matches one-half of the participant s contributions up to a total of 3 of the participant s wages.
Matching contributions vest in the participants accounts at a rate of 20 per year and become fully vested after five years. All
participants may select one or a combination of ten investment plans for their account. Distribution of amounts accumulated under the
savings plan occurs upon the termination of employment or death of the participant. The savings plan also contains loan and hardship withdrawal
provisions. 

 Pension Plan . We maintain a defined
benefit pension plan, the retirement plan for salaried and non-union employees of Corning Gas that covers substantially all our employees.
We make annual contributions to the plan equal to amounts determined in accordance with the funding requirements of the Employee Retirement
Security Act of 1974. The benefit payable under the pension plan is calculated based upon the employee s average salary for the
four years immediately preceding his or her retirement. As defined in the plan, the normal retirement age is 62. The compensation covered
by the pension plan includes only base salary, identified in the summary compensation table as salary.

Director Compensation 

 Historically, we have paid our directors,
other than our CEO Michael I. German, with restricted stock grants of 450 shares per quarter. The shares awarded will become unrestricted
upon a director leaving the board. We issued 450 shares to each of our directors for the first quarter of fiscal 2021. In January 2021,
we discontinued the issuance of stock compensation for our directors in connection with our entry into the merger agreement with Argo.
For the remainder of fiscal 2021, we compensated our non-employee directors with deferred cash awards equal in value to 450 shares a quarter
based on the closing price of our stock on the last day of each quarter. To conserve cash, our board members have elected to defer payment
of the cash board fees until the merger with Argo is completed. Information regarding the compensation of directors Henry B. Cook, Jr.,
Ted W. Gibson, Robert B. Johnston, Joseph P. Mirabito, William Mirabito, George J. Welch and John B. Williamson III for the fiscal year
ended September 30, 2021 is summarized below. Mr. German s compensation is described under Executive Compensation above.

Pending Merger with Argo

with the SEC with a focus on utilities and other long duration infrastructure assets. Subject to the terms and conditions of the merger
agreement, Argo will acquire the Company and pay our shareholders 24.75 for each share of common stock they own immediately prior to
completion of the merger without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes. See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,
for the impact of the merger on preferred shares. The merger will result in a change of control of the Company. Our shareholders approved
the merger on May 27, 2021. We expect to obtain the necessary regulatory approvals and complete the merger in 2022, but the exact timing
of the merger cannot be predicted. 

 Voting Agreement 

 On January 12, 2021, we entered a merger

Item 13. Certain
Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence. 

 Certain Relationships and Related Transactions 

 On July 1, 2020, we completed the acquisition
of the 50 interests in Leatherstocking Gas and Leatherstocking Pipeline held by Mirabito Regulated Industries, LLC. Immediately before
the acquisition, Leatherstocking Gas distributed to its members franchises, engineering and gas pipeline assets located in New York having
a book value of 532,000. These assets were then contributed to the equity of the newly-formed Leatherstocking Gas Company of New York,
Inc. The Company and Mirabito Regulated Industries each own 50 of Leatherstocking New York. Joseph Mirabito and William Mirabito are
officers, directors and are 20 and 21 shareholders, respectively, of Mirabito Holdings, Incorporated, a sister company of Mirabito Regulated
Industries. Together they hold approximately 5 of our outstanding common stock and are also directors of the Company, Corning Gas, Corning
Appliance, Leatherstocking Gas and Leatherstocking Pipeline. In fiscal 2021, we paid 120,705 to US Bank Voyager Fleet System for purchase
of gas for our service vehicles. Mirabito Holdings dba Mirabito Energy Products is a Voyager Network Partner. For coverage of emergency
services in the Town of Virgil in fiscal 2021, we paid Mirabito Holdings dba Mirabito Energy, Vestal, 28,783 

 We paid a total of 23,572 to the law firm
of Welch Law LLP for legal services performed during fiscal 2021. Director George Welch is the managing partner of Welch Law. 

 We paid 8,478 to Cook Brothers Truck Parts
in fiscal 2021. Director Henry Cook is the majority owner of Cook Brothers Truck Parts. 

 Director Independence 

 The board of directors has determined and
confirmed that each of Mr. Cook, Mr. Gibson, Mr. Johnston, Mr. Joseph Mirabito, Mr. William Mirabito, Mr. Welch,
and Mr. Williamson do not have a material relationship with the Company or any of its subsidiaries that would interfere with the
exercise of independent judgment and are, therefore, independent as defined by applicable laws and regulations and the listing standards
of the New York Stock Exchange. In making the determination that each of the members of our board and our board s committees is
independent, the board considered that Mr. Joseph Mirabito and Mr. William Mirabito are officers of Mirabito Regulated Industries,
LLC. The Company and Mirabito Regulated Industries are each 50 owners of Leatherstocking New York.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
 Board of Directors and Shareholders 
 Corning Natural Gas Holding Corporation and Subsidiaries 
 Opinion on the Financial Statements 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Corning Natural Gas Holding Corporation and Subsidiaries (the Company as of September 30, 2021 and 2020, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in stockholders equity, and cash flows for the years then ended, and the related notes to the consolidated financial statements (collectively referred to as the financial statements ). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of September 30, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
 Basis for Opinion 
 These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 
 Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 Critical Audit Matters 
 The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. 
 As discussed in Notes 1 and 5 to the consolidated financial statements, certain amounts are deferred and recognized as expenses or revenue when they are reflected in rates and recognized by customers in accordance with ASC 980. These items are recorded as regulatory assets or liabilities. We have identified this item as a critical audit matter because certain estimates and assumptions used by the Company in determining whether amounts are recoverable from or owed to customers in future rates is subjective and required auditor judgment. 
 Addressing the matter involved performing subjective procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. The primary procedures we performed include: reviewing and testing how management determined the amount of regulatory assets and liabilities by tracing appropriate amounts to current rate cases, auditing material regulatory assets and liabilities being deferred until the next rate case by reviewing and testing management s support, and reviewing filings with the New York and Pennsylvania Public Service Commissions and Orders from the New York and Pennsylvania Public Service Commissions, as necessary. 
 /s/ Freed Maxick CPAs, P.C. 
 We have served as the Company s auditor since 2013.

Marketable securities 

Financial assets and liabilities valued using level 1 inputs are based on unadjusted quoted market prices within active markets. 
 The pension assets in Note 12 are valued using level 1 inputs. 
 The Company has the obligation to deliver gas and electricity to its customers. As gas and electricity are immediately available for use upon delivery to the customer, the gas or electricity and its delivery are identifiable as a single performance obligation. The Company recognizes revenues as this performance obligation is satisfied over time as the Company delivers, and its customers simultaneously receive and consume, the gas or electricity. The amount of revenues recognized reflects the consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for delivering the gas or electricity. Under their tariffs, the transaction price for full-service customers includes the Company s energy cost and for all customers includes delivery charges determined based on customer class and in accordance with established tariffs and guidelines of the NYPSC or the PAPUC, as applicable. Accordingly, there is no unsatisfied performance obligation associated with these customers. The transaction price is applied to the Company s revenue generating activities through the customer billing process. Because gas and electricity are delivered over time, the Company uses output methods that recognize revenue based on direct measurement of the value transferred, such as units delivered, which provides an accurate measure of value for the gas or electricity delivered. 
 The Gas Company records revenues from residential and commercial customers based on meters read on a cyclical basis throughout each month, while certain large industrial and utility customers meters are read at the end of each month. Several meters are read at the end of each month to calculate local production revenues. The Gas Company does not accrue revenue for gas delivered but not yet billed, as the NYPSC requires that such accounting must be adopted during a rate proceeding which the Gas Company has not done. The Gas Company, as part of its currently effective rate plan, has a weather normalization clause as protection against severe weather fluctuations. This affects space heating customers and is activated when degree days are 2.2 greater or less than the 30-year average. As a result, the effect on revenue fluctuations of weather related gas sales is somewhat moderated. 
 Pike recognizes revenues for electric and gas service on a monthly billing cycle basis. Pike does not record unbilled revenues. Pike does not have a weather normalization clause as protection against severe weather. 
 Leatherstocking Gas recognizes revenues for gas service on a monthly billing cycle basis. Leatherstocking Gas does not record unbilled revenues. Leatherstocking Gas does not have a weather normalization clause as protection against severe weather. 
 In addition to weather normalization, the Gas Company has implemented a revenue decoupling mechanism RDM ). The RDM reconciles actual delivery service revenues to allowed delivery service revenues (which are based on the annual customer and volume forecasts in the last rate case) for certain residential customers. The Gas Company will refund or surcharge customers for differences between actual and allowed revenues. The shortfall or excess after the annual reconciliation will be surcharged or refunded to customers over a twelve-month period starting September 1 st each year. Pike and Leatherstocking Gas do not have a revenue decoupling mechanism as part of their rate structure.

Deferred rate case costs are costs that were incurred to litigate prior base rate cases. These costs are recovered in rates over a period determined by the NYPSC or PAPUC.

 In fiscal year 2015 the Gas Company determined that it met the criteria to record the minimum pension liability as a regulatory asset in accordance with FASB ASC 980-715-25-5. As a result of this change in estimate, amounts previously recorded as Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income, net of tax has been recorded as regulatory assets in the current year in accordance with ASC 980-715-25-8, as well as a related deferred tax liability. The amount of the regulatory asset was as of September 30, 2021 and as of September 30, 2020. For periods after the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015, there will be no change to Other Comprehensive Income because of the change in estimate. Factors considered included: (1) consistent recovery of the pension costs on an accrual basis historically and in the current rate case, (2) no indication of expected changes to recovery, and (3) the existence of a reconciliation process to track the recovery of these costs. For these reasons management determined the Gas Company met the criteria as set forth in ASC 980-725-25-5.

The Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model was used to estimate the fair value of share-based awards under FASB ASC Topic 718. The Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model incorporates various and highly subjective assumptions, including expected term and share price volatility. 
 The expected term of options granted was estimated to be the average of the vesting term, historical exercise and forfeiture rates, and the contractual life of the option. The share price volatility at the grant date is estimated using historical stock prices based upon the expected term of the options granted. The risk-free interest rate assumption is determined using the rates for U.S. Treasury zero-coupon bonds with maturities similar to those of the expected term of the award being valued.

For FY 2021 and FY 2020, the discount rate was prepared by utilizing an analysis of the plan s expected future cash flows and high-quality fixed-income investments currently available and expected to be available during the period to maturity of the pension benefits. The discount rate used is an estimate of the rate at which a defined benefit pension plan could settle its obligations. Rather than using a rate and curve developed using a bond portfolio, this method selects individual bonds to match to the expected cash flows of the Plan. Management feels this provides a more accurate depiction of the true cost to the Plan to settle the obligations as the Plan could theoretically go into the marketplace and purchase the specific bonds used in the analysis in order to settle the obligations of the Plan. 
 The expected returns on plan assets of the Retirement Plan and Post-Retirement Plan are applied to the market-related value of plan assets of the respective plans. For the Retirement Plan, the market-related value of assets recognizes the performance of its portfolio over five years and reduces the effects of short-term market fluctuations. The Gas Company s Retirement Plan assets are invested by a manager that reports at least annually to the Gas Company s Investment Committee for review and evaluation. The manager has been given the objective to achieve modest capital appreciation with a secondary objective of achieving a relatively high level of current income using a mix of cash equivalents, fixed income securities and equities to structure a balanced investment portfolio. The Investment Committee does not reserve control over investment decisions, with the exception of certain limitations, and holds the manager responsible and accountable to achieve the stated objectives. The market-related value of Post-Retirement Plan assets is set equal to market value. 
 For measurement purposes, an annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered benefits (health care cost trend rate) of for pre-65 year old medical, for post 65 year old medical, and for prescription drug benefits was assumed for FY 2022.
