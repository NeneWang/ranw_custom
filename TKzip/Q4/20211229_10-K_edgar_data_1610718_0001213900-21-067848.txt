 potentially , estimate , continue , anticipate , intend , could , would , project , plan ,
 expect and similar expressions that convey uncertainty of future events or outcomes are intended to identify forward-looking statements.
These statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other important factors that may cause our actual results, performance
or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performances or achievements expressed or implied by the forward-looking
statements. These forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements concerning the following: 

our
 future financial and operating results; 

our
 business strategy; 

our
 intentions, expectations and beliefs regarding anticipated growth, market penetration and
 trends in our business;

 effects of market conditions on our stock price and operating results;

 ability to timely and effectively adapt our existing technology and have our technology solutions
 gain market acceptance; 

our
 ability to introduce new products and bring them to market in a timely manner;

the
 effects of increased competition in our market and our ability to compete effectively;

economic risks. As such, our actual results could differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Moreover,
we operate in a competitive and changing environment, and new risks emerge from time to time. It is not possible for us to predict all
risks, nor can we assess the impact of all factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may
cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements we may make. In light of these risks,
uncertainties and assumptions, the forward-looking events and circumstances discussed in this Form 10-K may not occur, and actual results
could differ materially and adversely from those anticipated or implied in our forward-looking statements. 

You
should not rely upon forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. Although we believe that the expectations reflected
in our forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee that the future results, levels of activity, performance or events
and circumstances described in the forward-looking statements will be achieved or occur. Moreover, neither we nor any other person assumes
responsibility for the accuracy and completeness of the forward-looking statements. We undertake no obligation to update publicly any
forward-looking statements for any reason after the date of this Form 10-K to conform these statements to actual results or to changes
in our expectations, except as required by law. 

You

our actual future results and circumstances may be materially different from what we expect.

PART

1. Business 

Corporate
History 

Outdoor
Specialty Products, Inc. (the Company, we, or us was originally incorporated in the state
of Utah on January 31, 2014, and changed its domicile to the state of Nevada on February 24, 2021. The Company is and has since its inception
been engaged in the business of developing, selling, and marketing products in niche markets within the specialty outdoor products marketplace.
We introduced our proprietary Reel Guard product in 2014 and continue to offer it to customers. We intend to commence manufacturing,
marketing, and selling our new SLINKOR product in the near future, pursuant to a license agreement entered into with the
inventor in May 2021. We have no subsidiaries 

The
Reel Guard 

The
Reel Guard is designed to protect fishing reels from scratching, scuffing, dents, and other damage due to dropping, resting on gravel
while servicing the line, being transported with other fishing and outdoor equipment, and general wear and tear. To date, the primary
application for the Reel Guard has been fly fishing reels, but we believe the Reel Guard may also be suitable for use with some deep-sea
fishing reels. The Reel Guard consists of a thin, rubberized material that is attached to the outer edges of a fishing reel using special
adhesive strips that hold the material in place but provide for easy removal with no damage to the reel. The Reel Guard is designed for
reels with up to a 4.25-inch diameter that have square to slightly rounded edges, and the custom installation procedure makes the Reel
Guard suitable for a variety of different reels. The Reel Guard was invented by Kirk Blosch, the Company s founder and president,
in 2014 to fill a need that he believed was not being met by existing products. We filed for and obtained a provisional patent for the
Reel Guard in 2014 under the name Reel Bumper Guard and U.S. Patent No. 9,872,485 for the device was issued on January
23, 2018. We recently paid the first (fourth year) maintenance fee for the Reel Guard patent in the amount of 985 to prevent the patent
from lapsing. The next maintenance fee will be due on or before July 23, 2025. 

The
SLINKOR 

We
entered into a License and Royalty Agreement (the License Agreement ), dated as of May 4, 2021, with Stephen Smith (the
 Licensor ), for another fishing product referred to as the SLINKOR. The SLINKOR is a slow sinking fishing
sinker comprised of a smooth, egg-shaped piece of pre-molded foam with lead weights compressed into each end using a guide wire that
aligns the weights and allows a fishing line to be threaded through the product. The buoyancy of the foam coupled with the calibrated
weight of the lead and the movement of the water causes the SLINKOR to sink slowly to the bottom of a lake or river allowing the fisherman
to control the desired depth for the bait. The SLINKOR is designed for use with flies, spinners, flatfish, and other types of bait and
the weight of the SLINKOR permits the fisherman to make longer casts. The smooth egg shape of the SLINKOR is designed to let it slide
along the bottom of the lake or river while resting on top of moss or bouncing over rocks and greatly reducing snags. The device permits
a fisherman to run his line through the SLINKOR, attach a swivel, and run 18 to 30 inches of leader from the swivel to the bait based
on the current water conditions, the desired depth, and the presence or absence of moss, rocks, and other obstacles. The SLINKOR will
be available in two sizes; the large SLINKOR is 2 inches long and 1 inches wide and the small SLINKOR is 1 inches long
by 1 inches wide. 

The
License Agreement generally grants us the non-exclusive, world-wide right to use and apply the SLINKOR technology and any intellectual
property rights thereto and to make, have made, use, lease, sell, market, or otherwise dispose of the SLINKOR in all markets throughout
the world, and the exclusive right to market, sell or otherwise dispose of the SLINKOR in e-commerce markets throughout the world. The
License Agreement reserves to the Licensor the non-exclusive right to continue to manufacture and sell the SLINKOR in stores, at trade
shows, and in other brick and mortar physical locations and to purchase completed SLINKOR products from us (to the extent available)
at our cost plus 10 . In consideration for the rights granted under the License Agreement, we paid the Licensor a one-time license fee
in the amount of 500 and agreed to pay the Licensor the following royalties based on our net revenue from sales of the SLINKOR: (i)
20 of net revenue from product sales up to 1 Million, (ii) 15 of net revenue from product sales between 1 Million and 3 Million,
and (iii) 10 of net revenue from product sales in excess of 3 Million. We did not pay any royalties to the Licensor during the 2021
fiscal year. This summary description of the License Agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the License Agreement, a
copy of which is filed as an exhibit to this report.

Manufacturing 

We
own our custom injection mold for the Reel Guard, and we contract with a third party to manufacture the Reel Guard in minimum lots of
1,000 on an as needed basis. The adhesive strips used to attach the Reel Guard to the reel are manufactured by a national adhesives manufacturing
company and custom ordered in pre-cut lengths from a local distributor in minimum lots of 1,000. We contract with another third party
to print the Reel Guard product information card and package the Reel Guard product in sale-ready packages. Our Reel Guard inventory
consists of both the raw material adhesive strips and the finished, packaged product units. For the years ended September 30, 2021 and
2020, respectively, we had on hand 2,088 and 2,106 in finished goods and 2,596 and 2,596 in raw materials. 

We
intend to manufacture the SLINKOR at the residence of our president or in a small warehouse space that may be leased from a third party
subject to availability and acceptable rental rates. We will acquire raw materials consisting of the egg-shaped foam pieces and lead
weights and will use a custom hand press and a guide wire to compress the lead weights onto each end of the SLINKOR. We plan to use our
existing printing and packaging contractor to print the SLINKOR product information and package the SLINKOR in sale-ready packages. We
intend to manufacture an initial run of 1,000 SLINKOR units and to manufacture additional quantities as needed to meet demand. 

We
maintain an inventory of products which we believe is sufficient to meet demand. If we should underestimate sales and fail to timely
manufacture additional quantities of our products, we could face delays in providing our products to our customers which could have a
negative effect on our reputation and result in a decline in our product sales. If we should overestimate sales, we will have invested
our capital in products that remain in inventory, which will have a negative effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
No assurances can be given that we will be able to accurately predict sales and maintain an optimal level of inventory in our system. 

Although
we have purchased substantially all inventories from one supplier and have been dependent on this supplier for all inventory purchases
since we commenced operations, we believe the raw materials for both the Reel Guard and the SLINKOR are available for purchase from several
different sources in the open market. We also believe there are several other manufacturing, printing, and packaging services capable
of performing the services provided by our current contractors at competitive prices. Our ability to timely obtain raw materials and
finished goods may be affected by events beyond our control, such as the inability of suppliers to timely deliver materials due to work
stoppages or slowdowns, or significant weather and health conditions (such as COVID-19). Any adverse change in our supply chain and manufacturing,
such as our relationship with our third-party contractors, the financial condition of such contractors, and their ability to provide
supplies and services to us on a timely basis could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial
condition. 

Marketing
/ Shipping 

We
currently market and sell the Reel Guard through our website at outdoorspecialtyproducts.com , where we also provide
access to marketing materials, instructional videos, and installation instructions. We also list the Reel Guard for sale on eBay. To
date we have sold the Reel Guard to residents of approximately 25 states and have made one sale outside the U.S. to a resident of Hungary. 

We
intend to market the SLINKOR on our website and to expand our website to include marketing materials and SLINKOR instructional videos
created by the Licensor. 

Our
business is affected by seasonality, which historically has resulted in higher sales volume during the spring and summer months. 

2 

We
currently only accept PayPal as the method of payment for our products. Our products are shipped via U.S. Mail promptly following confirmation
from PayPal that payment for an order has been received. Shipping is included in the product price and a customer pays no additional
shipping charges. 

Other
Products 

We
have taken initial steps toward the development of a what we believe to be a unique fishing rod product that involves the ability to
attach different upper fly rod portions of varying lengths and weights to a single rod butt handle that results in a light weight, multi-purpose
fly rod. We have conducted preliminary research regarding the patentability of the proposed product and believe we may be able to obtain
patent protection for the product, although no assurances can be given that the product will be developed or that patent protection will
be obtained. We have halted our efforts regarding the development of this new product until such time as we have sufficient capital on
hand to proceed with its development. 

We
were formed with the belief that there is an underserved marketplace in the outdoor sporting goods space which can be exploited from
multiple fronts. In addition to the Reel Guard and the SLINKOR, we intend to investigate opportunities to develop additional products
and to market third party products in the outdoor sporting goods space on our website. 

Intellectual
Property 

We
hold a U.S. patent on our Reel Guard. We do not hold patents on any other products, and we do not currently hold any trademarks. No assurance
can be given that our patent will provide sufficient protection against potential competitors and we may be unable to successfully assert
our intellectual property rights, or these rights may be invalidated, circumvented, or challenged. Any such inability or a successful
intellectual property challenge or infringement proceeding against us, could have a material adverse effect on our business. 

Facilities 

Our
operations are currently conducted from at the residence of our president. Our facilities are furnished to us at no cost and consist
of the shared use of approximately 500 square feet of office space and assembly/storage space. In connection with the commencement of
manufacturing of the SLINKOR, we are investigating the desirability of leasing a small assembly, storage, and office space from a third
party. 

Competition 

The
outdoor specialty products industry is intensely competitive with respect to price, quality, features, and durability, and it is often
difficult to entice customers to try a new product. Many of our competitors are well-established companies with name brand recognition
and almost all our competitors have substantially greater financial and other resources than do we. Such competitors include many national
and regional companies and most of our competitors have been in existence for a substantially longer period than have we and are better
established. As such, there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively in our chosen market. In addition, a change
in the pricing, marketing, or promotional strategies or product mix of one or more of these competitors could have a material adverse
impact on our sales and earnings. 

Government
Regulation 

Our
operations are subject to numerous federal, state, and local government regulations. The failure to comply with such requirements or
increase in the cost of compliance could adversely affect our operations. We are also subject to federal and state environmental regulations,
but these have not had a material effect on our operations to date. Our operations are also subject to federal and state laws governing
such matters as wages, working conditions, citizenship requirements, and overtime. 

3 

Employees
and Consultants 

We
do not currently have any employees other than our founder and president. The loss of our president, would have a material adverse impact
on our business and there is no assurance that we could locate a qualified replacement. We have not entered into an employment agreement
with our president and we do not carry key man life insurance on his life. 

Financing 

Following
our incorporation in 2014, we completed the private placement of 285,714 shares of our common stock to accredited investors in a private
placement at a price of 0.35 per share for total proceeds of 100,011. The proceeds from the private placement together with our limited
product sales were sufficient to fund our operations through our fiscal year ended September 30, 2020. On January 4, 2021, we entered
into a revolving promissory note agreement with our president and principal stockholder which provided for total loans of up to 40,000
at an interest rate 3.5 per annum, which was repayable on or before December 31, 2021. As of September 30, 2021, we had borrowed an
aggregate principal amount of 30,250 under this revolving loan, no repayments had been made, and the accrued interest on the borrowed
funds was 409. During December 2021, we amended the revolving promissory note agreement to extend the maturity date to June 30, 2022,
and we entered into a new revolving promissory note agreement with another principal stockholder providing for loans of up to 7,000
at an interest rate of 3.5 per annum, which is repayable on or before June 30, 2022. During December 2021, we borrowed an aggregate
principal amount of 5,294 under the second revolving loan agreement.

Dividends 

Holders
of our common stock are entitled to dividends when, as, and if declared by our Board of Directors, out of funds legally available, therefore.
We have never declared cash dividends on our common stock and our Board of Directors does not anticipate paying cash dividends in the
foreseeable future as it intends to retain any future earnings to finance the growth of our business. There are no restrictions in our
articles of incorporation or bylaws that restrict us from declaring dividends. 

Securities
Authorized for Issuance Under Equity Compensation Plans 

As
of the end of the latest fiscal year ended September 30, 2021, the only compensation plans (including individual compensation arrangements)
under which our equity securities were authorized for issuance was our 2021 Stock Incentive Plan, adopted on February 8, 2021, which
authorizes the issuance of up to 1,000,000 shares of our common stock in awards granted as incentive or non-statutory stock options,
restricted stock units, stock appreciation rights, or restricted stock grants. The 10-year plan is administered by our Board of Directors.
No awards have been made under the plan to date. 

Special
Sales Practice Requirements with Regard to Penny Stocks 

In
order to protect investors from patterns of fraud and abuse that have occurred in the market for low priced securities commonly referred
to as penny stocks, the SEC has adopted regulations that generally define a penny stock to be any equity
security having a market price (as defined) less than 5.00 per share, or an exercise price of less than 5.00 per share, subject to
certain exceptions. The price of our stock is currently below 5.00 per share and our stock is subject to the penny stock 
regulations. As a result, broker-dealers selling our common stock are subject to additional sales practices when they sell our stock
to persons other than established clients and accredited investors. For transactions covered by these rules, before the
transaction is executed, the broker-dealer must make a special customer suitability determination, receive the purchaser s written
consent to the transaction and deliver a risk disclosure document relating to the penny stock market. The broker-dealer must also disclose
the commission payable to both the broker-dealer and the registered representative taking the order, current quotations for the securities
and, if applicable, the fact that the broker-dealer is the sole market maker and the broker-dealer s presumed control over the
market. Monthly statements must be sent disclosing recent price information for the penny stock held in the account and information on
the limited market in penny stocks. Such penny stock rules may restrict trading in our common stock and may deter broker-dealers
from effecting transactions in our common stock.

our 2021 fiscal year. In connection with our change of domicile to the State of Nevada through the merger of the Utah corporation into
a Nevada corporation in February 2021, we repurchased 1,429 shares of our common stock from a shareholder for 500 upon the shareholders 
exercise of dissenters rights, which shares were cancelled and returned to the status of authorized and unissued shares.

Item
7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

You
should read the following discussion in conjunction with our financial statements, which are included elsewhere in this report. 

The
following discussion contains forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements give our current expectations or forecasts of future
events. You can identify these statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. They use words
such as anticipate , estimate , expect , project , intend , plan , believe , and other words
and terms of similar meaning in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance. From time to time, we also
may provide forward-looking statements in other materials we release to the public. 

Overview 

We
are and have since our inception in 2014 been engaged in the business of developing, selling, and marketing products in niche markets
within the specialty outdoor products marketplace. We introduced our proprietary Reel Guard product in 2014 and continue
to offer it to customers. We intend to commence manufacturing, marketing, and selling our new SLINKOR product in the near
future, pursuant to a license agreement entered into with the inventor in May 2021. 

In
March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of a novel coronavirus (COVID-19) as a pandemic, which continues to spread
throughout the world. While the disruption is currently expected to be temporary, there is uncertainty around its duration. As a result
of COVID-19 mobility restrictions globally, there have been changes in consumer behavior. We expect these changes in behavior to continue
to evolve as the pandemic progresses. The impacts seen to date may continue to create a wider range of outcomes as consumer behaviors
and mobility restrictions continue to evolve. 

6 

The
report of our auditor and our financial statements contain a going concern limitation based on our failure to generate sufficient revenue
to produce net income and on our limited operating history. These factors, among others, indicate that there is a substantial doubt about
our ability to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time. Our continuation as a going concern is dependent upon our
ability to generate sufficient cash flow to meet our obligations on a timely basis and ultimately to obtain profitability. We believe
the addition of our new SLINKOR product will result in increased sales and additional cash flow, although no assurances can be given
that the SLINKOR will be accepted in the marketplace or that its addition to our product line will result in a material increase in sales. 

Results
of Operations 

Sales 

From
our inception in 2014 through the present, our revenues have resulted solely from sales of our proprietary Reel Guard product and our
costs of sales also relate solely to that product. Total sales for the year ended September 30, 2021, were 204, compared to 548 for
the year ended September 30, 2020, a decrease of 344, or approximately 63 . We believe travel restrictions and changes in consumer behavior
caused by the COVID-19 pandemic may have had an adverse effect on sales. 

Cost
of Sales 

Cost
of sales for 2021 was 18, compared to 48 for 2020, a decrease of 30, or 63 . The decrease in cost of sales in 2021 is primarily attributed
to the decrease in sales discussed above. Cost of sales as a percentage of sales for 2021 and 2020 was approximately 9 . Cost of sales
as a percentage of sales remained fairly constant during such periods since we offered only one product for sale and the sales price
and manufacturing costs have not changed significantly. 

General
and Administrative Expenses 

General
and administrative expenses were 39,678 for 2021, compared to 12,324 for 2020, an increase of 27,354 or approximately 222 . The increase
in these expenses is primarily attributable to an increase in our legal and accounting expenses in connection with our change of corporate
domicile from Utah to Nevada and the preparation and filing of our Form 10 registration statement. 

Depreciation
and Amortization Expense 

Depreciation
and amortization expenses currently are not material to our business. Depreciation expense was 631 for 2021 and 757 for 2020 resulting
from the depreciation of our injection molds for the Reel Guard product using the straight-line method over the useful life which is
determined to be seven years. Amortization expense was 408 for 2021 and 382 for 2020 resulting from the amortization of our patent
over seventeen years, which is its estimated legal life. 

Research
and Development Expenses 

Research
and development expenses are not currently material to our business. We did not incur research and development expenses in either 2021
or 2020. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

As
of September 30, 2021, we had total current assets of 11,310, including cash of 6,168, and current liabilities of 31,073, resulting
in a working capital deficit of 19,763. Our current liabilities include an outstanding balance of 30,250 under the short-term revolving
loan agreement from our president for which the due date has been extended to June 30, 2022. As of September 30, 2021, we had an accumulated
stockholders deficit of 119,280. We have financed our operations from sales of our Reel Guard product, proceeds from our 2014
private placement, and proceeds from the short-term revolving loan agreement from our president and principal stockholder in early 2021. 

7 

For
2021, net cash used by operating activities was 38,062, as a result of a net loss of 39,901, reduced by depreciation and amortization
of 1,039, a decrease in inventory of 18, an increase in accounts payable of 414, and an increase in accrued interest of 409, and
increased by an increase in prepaid expense of 41. By comparison, for 2020 net cash used by operating activities was 8,637, as a result
of a net loss of 11,824, reduced by depreciation and amortization of 1,139, a decrease in prepaid expense of 2,000, and a decrease
in inventory of 48. 

In
2021, we had no cash flows used in or provided by investing activities. In 2020, we had net cash used in investing activities of 916
for the initial maintenance fee on the Reel Guard patent. 

In
2021, we had net cash provided by financing activities of 29,750 consisting of 30,250 in proceeds from the revolving loan agreement
with our president, decreased by 500 for our repurchase of shares of common stock pursuant to a stockholder s exercise of dissenters 
rights in connection with our change of domicile merger. 

Following
our incorporation in 2014, we completed the private placement of 285,714 shares of our common stock to accredited investors in a private
placement at a price of 0.35 per share for total proceeds of 100,011. The proceeds from the private placement together with our limited
product sales were sufficient to fund our operations through our fiscal year ended September 30, 2020. On January 4, 2021, we entered
into a revolving promissory note agreement with our president and principal stockholder which provided for total loans of up to 40,000
at an interest rate 3.5 per annum, which was repayable on or before December 31, 2021. As of September 30, 2021, we had borrowed an
aggregate principal amount of 30,250 under this revolving loan, no repayments had been made, and the accrued interest on the borrowed
funds was 409. During December 2021, we amended the revolving promissory note agreement to extend the maturity date to June 30, 2022,
and we entered into a new revolving promissory note agreement with another principal stockholder providing for loans of up to 7,000
at an interest rate of 3.5 per annum, which is repayable on or before June 30, 2022. During December 2021, we borrowed an aggregate
principal amount of 5,294 under the second revolving loan agreement. 

We
believe we have adequate funds to meet our obligations for the next twelve months from our current cash, the revolving note agreements,
and projected cash flows from operations. Cash flow from operations has not historically been sufficient to sustain our operations without
the above additional sources of capital. Our future working capital requirements will depend on many factors, including the expansion
of our product lines to include the new SLINKOR product. To the extent our cash, cash equivalents, and cash flows from operating activities
and the revolving note agreements are insufficient to fund our future activities, we may need to raise additional funds through private
equity or debt financing. We also may need to raise additional funds in the event we determine in the future to effect one or more acquisitions
of businesses, technologies, and products. If additional funding is required, we may not be able to affect an equity or debt financing
on terms acceptable to us or at all. 

In
addition, COVID-19 and related measures to contain its impact have caused material disruptions in both national and global financial
markets and economies. The future impact of COVID-19 and these containment measures cannot be predicted with certainty and may increase
our borrowing costs and other costs of capital and otherwise adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition
and liquidity, and no assurance can be given that we will have access to external financing at times and on terms we consider acceptable,
or at all, or that we will not experience other liquidity issues going forward. 

Requirements 

The
Company currently has no lease obligations or requirements and has not entered into any agreements that require a commitment of cash. 

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements 

As
of September 30, 2021, and 2020, we did not have any off-balance sheet financing arrangements.

Critical
Accounting Policies 

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires our management
to make assumptions, estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements, including the notes thereto,
and related disclosures of commitments and contingencies, if any. We consider our critical accounting policies to be those that require
the more significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of financial statements, including the following: 

Accounting
Estimates 

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 

Cash
and Cash Equivalents 

For
the purpose of the financial statements, the Company considers all highly liquid debt instruments purchased with a maturity of three
months or less to be cash equivalents. 

Inventories 

Inventories,
consisting primarily of injection molded Reel Guards and Adhesive Strips, are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, with
cost determined using primarily the first-in-first-out (FIFO) method. 

Patents 

Patents
consist of the cost of obtaining the patent for the Reel Guard. Our patents are amortized over their legal life (typically 17 years)
and analyzed periodically for impairment in accordance with ASC 350, Intangibles Goodwill and Other. 

Revenue
Recognition 

When
the Company sells a reel protector, it recognizes revenue in accordance with Accounting Standards Update 2014-09 (ASC 606, Revenue from
Contracts with Customers). Under ASC 606, the Company recognizes revenue upon the transfer of promised goods to customers in amounts
that reflect the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled. The Company considers revenue earned when all the following
criteria are met: (i) the contract with the customer has been identified, (ii) the performance obligations have been identified, (iii)
the transaction price has been determined, (iv) the transaction price has been allocated to the performance obligations, and (v) the
performance obligations have been satisfied. 

9 

Property,
Plant, and Equipment 

The
Company s capital asset consists of molding equipment for the Reel Guard stated at cost. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line
method over the estimated useful life which is determined to be seven years. Expenditures for additions and improvements are capitalized,
while repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred. The cost and related accumulated depreciation of any capital assets that
are sold or otherwise disposed of are removed from the accounts and any gain or loss is recorded in the year of disposal. 

Income
Taxes 

The
Company follows ASC 740-10, which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial
statements. This standard requires a company to determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon
examination based upon the technical merits of the position. If the more-likely-than- not threshold is met, a company must measure the
tax position to determine the amount to recognize in the financial statements. 

Deferred
taxes are provided on a liability method whereby deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences and operating
loss, and tax credit carryforwards and deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences. Temporary differences
are the differences between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax basis. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a
valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets
will not be realized. The Company has followed the guidance provided by Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 118 to calculate the value
of the deferred tax calculation and current income tax calculation to show the effect of the Tax Cut and Jobs Act of 2017. Effective
January 1, 2018, the corporate tax rate is now 21 percent for all income levels. 

The
Company adopted changes issued by FASB which prescribed a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for financial statement recognition
and measurement of an uncertain tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Under the guidance, an uncertain income tax
position must be recognized at the largest amount that is more-likely-than-not to be sustained upon audit by the relevant taxing authority.

Disclosure
Controls and Procedures 

Under
the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our President and Treasurer who serves as our principal executive
and principal financial officer, we evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures
(as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 the Exchange Act as of September
30, 2021, the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon that evaluation, our President and Treasurer, concluded that our disclosure
controls and procedures as of September 30, 2021 were effective such that the information required to be disclosed by us in reports filed
under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules
and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our President and Treasurer, as appropriate to allow timely
decisions regarding disclosure. A controls system cannot provide absolute assurance that the objectives of the controls system are met,
and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within a company
have been detected.

10. Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance 

The
following table sets forth the names and ages of the member of our Board of Director and our executive officers and the positions held
by each. 

Name 
 
 Age 
 
 Title 
 
 Kirk
 Blosch 
 
 67 
 
 President,
 CEO, and Chairman 

Kirk
Blosch is the founder of the Company and has been its sole officer and director since its inception in 2014. Since 2008 he has been the
owner and principal broker of B B Real Estate Group LLC, a Salt Lake City, Utah, based real estate firm providing sales, consulting,
and development services. Mr. Blosch has over 35 years of experience in evaluating business opportunities, creating business or development
plans, funding various projects, and overseeing the construction and development of real estate projects. He received his Bachelor of
Science degree in organizational communication from the University of Utah in 1976. 

Family
Relationships 

There
are no family relationships among our directors, executive officers or persons nominated or chosen to become directors or executive officers. 

Board
of Directors 

Our
board of directors consists of one person, Kirk Blosch. Such person is not independent within the meaning of Rule 5605(a)(2)
of the NASDAQ Marketplace because he is an officer of the Company. 

Our
board of directors has not appointed any standing committees, there is no separately designated audit committee and the Company s
single, non-independent board member performs the functions that would customarily be performed by an audit committee. The board of directors
does not have an independent financial expert because it does not believe the scope of the Company s activities to
date has justified the expenses involved in obtaining such a financial expert. In addition, our securities are not listed on a national
exchange and we are not subject to the special corporate governance requirements of any such exchange. 

The
Company does not have a compensation committee and the Company s single, non-independent board member participates in the consideration
of executive officer and director compensation. To date, the Company has not paid any executive or director compensation and has not
engaged independent compensation consultants to determine or recommend the amount or form of executive or director compensation. 

The
Company does not have a standing nominating committee and the Company s single, non-independent board member performs the functions
that would customarily be performed by a nominating committee. The board of directors does not believe a separate nominating committee
is required at this time due to the limited size of the Company s business operations and the limited resources of the Company
that do not permit it to compensate its directors. The board of directors has not established policies with regard to the consideration
of director candidates recommended by security holders or the minimum qualifications of such candidates. 

11 

Code
of Ethics 

We
have not adopted a Code of Ethics that applies to our executive officers, including our principal executive, financial and accounting
officers. We do not believe the adoption of a code of ethics at this time would provide any meaningful additional protection to the Company
because we have only one officer and our business operations are not extensive or complex. 

Director
Meetings and Stockholder Meeting Attendance 

The
Board of Directors held no formal meetings during 2021 and the sole director took action by unanimous written consents in lieu of meetings.
Our policy is to encourage, but not require, members of the Board of Directors to attend annual stockholder meetings. We did not hold
an annual stockholder meeting during the 2021 year. 

Communications
with Directors 

Shareholders
may communicate with the Board of Directors or any individual director by sending written communications addressed to the Board of Directors,
or any individual director, to: Outdoor Specialty Products, Inc., Attention: Corporate Secretary, 3842 Quail Hollow Drive, Salt Lake
City, Utah 84109. All communications will be compiled by the corporate secretary and forwarded to the Board of Directors or any individual
director, as appropriate. In order to facilitate a response to any such communication, the Company s Board of Directors suggests,
but does not require, that any such submission include the name and contact information of the shareholder submitting the communication. 

Delinquent
Section 16(a) Reports 

Based on our review of Forms 3 and 4 and amendments thereto filed electronically
with the SEC during the 2021 fiscal year, Ed Bailey, a beneficial owner of more than ten percent of our common stock, failed to file the
Form 3 report required as a result of the effectiveness of our Form 10 registration statement. Mr. Bailey advised us that he plans to
file the report at the earliest practicable date and that he was unable to file the report prior to the filing of this report due to a
problem in updating his Edgar filing codes. 

Item
11. Executive Compensation 

Kirk
Blosch, our President, Secretary and Treasurer, is our only employee. We did not pay any executive compensation during the fiscal years
ended September 30, 2021 and 2020. We have not entered into any employment agreements with our officers and directors. We reimburse our
officers for reasonable costs and expenses incurred by them in connection with our business. 

We
have not granted our officers or directors any stock options, stock awards or other forms of equity compensation. 

We
do not have any retirement, pension or profit-sharing plans covering our officers or directors, and we are not contemplating implementing
any such plans at this time. 

Director
Compensation 

We
did not pay our sole director any compensation for serving in his capacity as a director during the fiscal years ended September 30,
2021 and 2020.

As of September 30, 2021, we had borrowed an aggregate principal amount of 30,250 under this revolving loan, no repayments had been
made, and the accrued interest on the borrowed funds was 409. During December 2021, we amended the revolving promissory note agreement
to extend the maturity date to June 30, 2022. We also entered into a new revolving promissory note agreement with another principal stockholder,
providing for loans of up to 7,000 at an interest rate of 3.5 per annum, which is repayable on or before June 30, 2022. During December
2021, we borrowed an aggregate principal amount of 5,294 under the second revolving loan agreement. 

Director
Independence 

Our
board of directors consists of one person, Kirk Blosch. Such person is not independent within the meaning of Rule 5605(a)(2)
of the NASDAQ Marketplace because he is an officer of the Company. 

Indemnification 

Nevada
law expressly authorizes a Nevada corporation to indemnify its directors, officers, employees, and agents against liabilities arising
out of such persons conduct as directors, officers, employees, or agents if they acted in good faith, in a manner they reasonably
believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the company, and, in the case of criminal proceedings, if they had no reasonable
cause to believe their conduct was unlawful. Generally, indemnification for such persons is mandatory if such person was successful,
on the merits or otherwise, in the defense of any such proceeding, or in the defense of any claim, issue, or matter in the proceeding.
In addition, as provided in the articles of incorporation, bylaws, or an agreement, the corporation may pay for or reimburse the reasonable
expenses incurred by such a person who is a party to a proceeding in advance of final disposition if such person furnishes to the corporation
an undertaking to repay such expenses if it is ultimately determined that he did not meet the requirements. In order to provide indemnification,
unless ordered by a court, the corporation must determine that the person meets the requirements for indemnification. Such determination
must be made by a majority of disinterested directors; by independent legal counsel; or by a majority of the shareholders. 

13 

Article
X of our Articles of Incorporation provides that we must pay expenses of officers and directors incurred in defending a civil or criminal
action, suit or proceeding, involving alleged acts or omissions of such officer or director in his or her capacity as an officer or director
as they are incurred and in advance of the final disposition of the action, suit or proceeding, upon receipt of an undertaking by or
on behalf of the director or officer to repay the amount if it is ultimately determined by a court of competent jurisdiction that he
or she is not entitled to be indemnified by us. 

Insofar
as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 1933 (the Act may be permitted to directors, officers
and controlling persons of our company pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or otherwise, we have been advised that in the opinion of
the Securities and Exchange Commission, such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Act and is, therefore, unenforceable.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED
PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders 

 Outdoor Specialty Products, Inc. 

 Salt Lake City, Utah 

Opinion on the Financial Statements 

We have audited the accompanying balance
sheets of Outdoor Specialty Products, Inc. (the Company) as of September 30, 2021 and 2020, and the related statements of operations,
changes in stockholders equity (deficit), and cash flows for the years then ended, and the related notes (collectively referred
to as the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position
of the Company as of September 30, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 

Consideration of the Company s
Ability to Continue as a Going Concern 

The accompanying financial statements
have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. The Company has suffered recurring losses since inception,
has a working capital deficit, and has not achieved profitable operations, which raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue
as a going concern. Management s plans in regard to these matters are described in Note 7. The financial statements do not include
any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

Basis for Opinion 

These financial statements are the responsibility
of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our
audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are
required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and
regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We conducted our audits in accordance
with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were
we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an
understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the
Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our audits included performing procedures
to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that
respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

Critical
Audit Matter 

The critical
audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or
required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial
statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters
does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit
matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. 

F- 1 

Going Concern Disclosure 

The financial statements of the Company
are prepared on a going concern basis, which assumes that the Company will continue in operation for the foreseeable future and, accordingly,
will be able to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of operations. As noted in Going Concern
Considerations above, the Company has a history of recurring net losses, a significant accumulated deficit and currently has net
working capital deficit. The Company has contractual obligations such as commitments for repayments of accounts payable, accrued interest,
and line credit related party (collectively obligations ). Currently management s forecasts and related assumptions
illustrate their ability to meet the obligations through management of expenditures, obtaining additional financing through loans from
related and unrelated parties, and private placements of capital stock for additional funding to meet its operating needs. Should there
be constraints on the ability to access financing through stock issuances, the Company will continue to manage cash outflows and meet
the obligations through related and unrelated party loans. 

We identified management s assessment
of the Company s ability to continue as a going concern as a critical audit matter. Management made judgments to conclude that it
is probable that the Company s plans will be effectively implemented and will provide the necessary cash flows to fund the Company s
obligations as they become due. Specifically, the judgments with the highest degree of impact and subjectivity in determining it is probable
that the Company s plans will be effectively implemented include its ability to manage expenditures, its access funding from the
capital market, and obtain loans from related and unrelated parties. Auditing the judgments made by management required a high degree
of auditor judgment and an increased extent of audit effort. 

Addressing the matter involved performing
procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the financial statements. These procedures
included the following, among others: (i) evaluating the probability that the Company will be able to access funding from the capital
market; (ii) evaluating the probability that the Company will be able to manage expenditures, and (iii) evaluating the probability that
the Company will be able to obtain loans from related and unrelated parties.

 Notes to Financial Statements 

 September 30, 2021 and 2020 

Note 1 Organization and Summary of Significant
Accounting Policies 

Organization Outdoor Specialty
Products, Inc. (the Company was incorporated in the State of Utah on January 31, 2014 and changed its domicile to the state
of Nevada on February 24, 2021. The Company is in the business of developing and selling outdoor products with its first product focused
on a reel protector for fishing reels. The Company also will be selling third party products through its website. The Company has elected
a September 30 fiscal year end. 

Accounting Estimates The preparation
of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America requires management
to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual
results could differ from those estimates. 

Cash and Cash Equivalents For the
purpose of the financial statements, the Company considers all highly liquid debt instruments purchased with original maturities of three
months or less to be cash equivalents. 

Inventories Inventories, consisting
primarily of injection molded Reel Guards and Adhesive Strips, are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, with cost determined
using primarily the first-in-first-out (FIFO) method. The Company purchased substantially all inventories from one supplier and
has been dependent on this supplier for all inventory purchases since we commenced operations. The Company has 2,088 and 2,106 in finished
goods and 2,596 and 2,596 in raw materials for the years ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. 

Patents Patents consist of the
cost of obtaining a patent for the Company s reel protector. Our patents are amortized over their legal life (typically 17 years)
and analyzed periodically for impairment in accordance with ASC 350, Intangibles Goodwill and Other. 

Revenue Recognition When the Company
sells a reel protector, it recognizes revenue in accordance with Accounting Standards Update 2014-09 (ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts
with Customers). Under ASC 606, the Company recognizes revenue upon the transfer of promised goods to customers in amounts that reflect
the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled. The Company considers revenue earned when all the following criteria are
met: (a) the contract with the customer has been identified, (ii) the performance obligations have been identified, (iii) the transaction
price has been determined, (iv) the transaction price has been allocated to the performance obligations, and (v) the performance obligations
have been satisfied. 

The Company earned 204 and 548 in revenue during
the years ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

 September 30, 2021 and 2020 

Note 1 Organization and Summary of Significant
Accounting Policies (continued) 

Recently Enacted Pronouncements 
 The Company has reviewed all recently issued, but not yet adopted, accounting standards in order to determine their effects,
if any, on its results of operation, financial position or cash flows. Based on that review, the Company believes that none of these
pronouncements will have a significant effect on its current or future earnings or operations. 

Basic and Diluted Loss Per Share - Basic
loss per share is computed by dividing net loss attributable to common shares by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding
during the period. Diluted loss per share is computed by dividing net income attributable to common shares for the period by the weighted
average number of common and potential common shares outstanding during the period. Potential common shares are included in the calculation
of diluted net income per share, when they are present in the financial statements, to the extent such shares are dilutive. During the
years ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, the Company did not have any stock options, warrants, or other convertible or potentially-dilutive
instruments issued and outstanding. 

NOTE 2 Income Tax 

The Company follows ASC 740-10, which clarifies
the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a company s financial statements. This standard requires a company
to determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination based upon the technical merits
of the position. If the more-likely-than- not threshold is met, a company must measure the tax position to determine the amount to recognize
in the financial statements. 

Deferred taxes are provided on a liability method
whereby deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences and operating loss, and tax credit carry-forwards and
deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences. Temporary differences are the differences between the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax basis. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of
management, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The Company followed
the guidance provided by Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 118 to calculate the value of the deferred tax calculation and current income
tax calculation to show the effect of the Tax Cut and Jobs Act of 2017. Effective January 1, 2018 the corporate tax rate is now 21 percent
for all income levels.

At September 30, 2021, the Company had net operating
loss carryforwards of approximately 119,000 that may be offset against future taxable income as long as the continuity of ownership 
test is met. No tax benefit has been reported in the September 30, 2021 financial statements since the potential tax benefit
is offset by a valuation allowance of the same amount. The years 2018-2021 are open to examination by the IRS. No reserves
for uncertain tax positions have been recorded. 

The Company adopted changes issued by FASB which
prescribed a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for financial statement recognition and measurement of an uncertain tax position
taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Under the guidance, an uncertain income tax position must be recognized at the largest
amount that is more-likely-than-not to be sustained upon audit by the relevant taxing authority.

NOTE 3 Long Lived Assets 

Property, Plant, and Equipment 

The Company s capital asset consists of
molding equipment stated at cost. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life
which is determined to be seven years. Expenditures for additions and improvements are capitalized, while repairs and maintenance
costs are expensed as incurred. The cost and related accumulated depreciation of any capital assets that are sold or otherwise
disposed of are removed from the accounts and any gain or loss is recorded in the year of disposal.

NOTE 4 Line of Credit Related
Party 

During the year ending September 30, 2021, the
Company entered into a revolving promissory note agreement with a related party which allows the Company to borrow up to a maximum of
 40,000, with funds being advanced from time to time upon request by the Company. The revolving promissory note bears interest at the
rate of 3.5 . During December 2021, we amended the revolving promissory note agreement to extend the maturity date to June 30, 2022 and
we entered into a new revolving promissory note agreement with another principal stockholder providing for loans of up to 7,000 at an
interest rate of 3.5 per annum, which is repayable on or before June 30, 2022. The balance on the line of credit on September 30, 2021
was 30,250 with accrued interest of 409. 

NOTE 5 Stockholders Equity 

During the year ending September 20, 2021, the
Company increased its authorized common shares from 90,000,000 to 190,000,000. Also, during the year ending September 30, 2021, the Company
repurchased 1,429 shares of our common stock from a shareholder for 500 upon the shareholders exercise of dissenters rights,
which shares were cancelled.

NOTE 7 Going Concern 

The accompanying financial statements have been
prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course
of business. As shown in the accompanying financial statements, the Company did not generate sufficient revenue to generate
net income and has a limited operating history. These factors, among others, indicate that there is substantial doubt that the Company
will be able to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time. 

The financial statements do not include any adjustments
relating to the recoverability and classification of assets and liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue
as a going concern. The Company s continuation as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to generate sufficient
cash flow to meet its obligations on a timely basis and ultimately to attain profitability. The Company intends to seek additional
funding through equity offerings to fund its business plan. There is no assurance that the Company will be successful in raising
additional funds. 

NOTE 8 Subsequent Events 

During
December 2021, we amended the revolving promissory note agreement to extend the maturity date to June 30, 2022, and we entered into a
new revolving promissory note agreement with another principal stockholder providing for loans of up to 7,000 at an interest rate of
3.5 per annum, which is repayable on or before June 30, 2022. During December 2021, we borrowed an aggregate principal amount of 5,294
under the second revolving loan agreement . 

The Company has evaluated subsequent events from
the balance sheet date through the date of the financial statements were issued and determined that there are no additional events requiring
disclosure.
