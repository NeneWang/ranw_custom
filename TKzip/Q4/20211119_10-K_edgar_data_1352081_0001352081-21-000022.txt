PART I 

ITEM 1. BUSINESS 
 
 Business Development 
 
 Cardinal Ethanol, LLC is an Indiana limited liability company formed on February 7, 2005 with the name of Indiana Ethanol, LLC. On September 27, 2005, we changed our name to Cardinal Ethanol, LLC. References to we, us, our, Cardinal and the Company refer to Cardinal Ethanol, LLC. We began producing ethanol, distillers grains and corn oil at the plant in November 2008 (the "Ethanol Division"). In addition, in 2017 we added a facility to allow us to procure, transport and sell grain commodities through our new grain operations (the "Trading Division"). 
 
 The ethanol industry experienced industry-wide record low ethanol prices throughout most of 2018 and 2019 due to reduced demand and high industry inventory levels. This continued into 2020 and the situation was compounded by the crisis associated with the 2019 novel coronavirus disease COVID-19 ). In response to these unfavorable operating conditions and a slowdown in global and regional economic activity and a disruption in transportation fuel demand resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, we reduced our ethanol production rate by approximately 20 in April of 2020. However, beginning in May of 2020, we returned to full production and have since been operating at an ethanol production rate of approximately 135 million gallons annually which is approximately 35 above the nameplate capacity for the plant. We were able to hold these production levels throughout the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021. 
 
 On February 3, 2021, we executed a Sixteenth Amendment of First Amended and Restated Construction Loan Agreement, to be effective as of January 26, 2021, which amended the First Amended and Restated Construction Loan Agreement dated June 10, 2013 (the "Sixteenth Amendment") with our primary lender, First National Bank of Omaha ("FNBO"). The primary purposes of the Sixteenth Amendment were to extend the termination dates of the Revolving Credit Loan and Declining Revolving Loan to April 30, 2021, and increase the limit under the Revolving Credit Loan to 20,000,000. In connection with the Sixteenth Amendment, we executed a First Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Note. 
 
 On April 30, 2021, we executed a Seventeenth Amendment of First Amended and Restated Construction Loan Agreement which amends the First Amended and Restated Construction Loan Agreement dated June 10, 2013 (the "Seventeenth Amendment") with FNBO. The primary purposes of the Seventeenth Amendment were to extend the termination dates of the Declining Loan to February 28, 2023 and the Revolving Credit Loan to February 28, 2022 and modify the applicable interest rates for both loans. The interest rates for these two loans are based on the U.S. Prime Rate published in the Wall Street Journal. The interest rate on the Declining Loan is the prime rate minus .15 percent and the interest rate on the Revolving Credit Loan is the prime rate minus .25 percent. 
 
 Effective June 1, 2021, we entered into a Third Amendment to Carbon Dioxide Purchase and Sale Agreement (the "Amendment") which amends the Carbon Dioxide Purchase and Sale Agreement dated March 8, 2010, as amended on November 22, 2011 and April 30, 2020 (the "Agreement") with Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. ("Air Products"). The Amendment extended the initial term of the Agreement to May 31, 2026 with automatic one-year renewal periods thereafter unless terminated by either party by providing at least six months written notice prior to the expiration of the term. The Amendment amended the price paid for carbon dioxide subject to a price adjustment in the event of a take or pay shortfall. The Amendment also provided that we may do anything we wish with excess carbon dioxide gas produced provided that if the excess is sold to competitors of Air Products then Air Products' annual take or pay obligation will be reduced accordingly and Air Products has the option to terminate the Agreement upon 90 days written notice. In addition, the Amendment provides that, after the three year anniversary of the Effective Date, Cardinal may, after providing the required notice, terminate the Agreement upon the occurrence of a Change of Control Event as defined in the Amendment or if Cardinal decides to sequester its carbon dioxide. 
 
 Reportable Operating Segments 
 
 Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise for which separate financial information is available that are evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. Based on the nature of the products, services and operations and the expected financial results, we review our operations within the following two separate operating segments: (1) ethanol production through our Ethanol Division; and (2) trading of agricultural grains through our Trading Division. We currently do not have or anticipate we will have any other lines of business or other significant sources of revenue other than the sale of ethanol, distillers grains, corn oil and and the trading of agricultural grains.

Ethanol Division 
 
 In October 2020, we obtained a new Title V air permit allowing us to increase our annual ethanol production to 175 million gallons compared to 140 million gallons under our previous permit. Our annual ethanol production for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020 decreased to approximately 129 million gallons resulting primarily from reduced ethanol production rates for the period. In March of 2020, we reduced our ethanol production rate by approximately 20 due to unfavorable operating conditions in the ethanol industry and the COVID-19 pandemic. However, beginning in May of 2020, we increased our ethanol production rate to approximately 135 million gallons annually which is approximately 35 above the nameplate capacity for the plant. We were able to hold these production levels throughout the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021. 
 
 Our revenues are primarily derived from the sale of our ethanol, distillers grains and corn oil. We market and sell ethanol and its co-products (distillers grains and corn oil) primarily in the continental United States using third party marketers. Murex, LLC markets all of our ethanol. Our distillers grains are marketed by CHS, Inc. We market and distribute all of the corn oil we produce directly to end users and third party brokers. 
 
 Principal Products 
 
 The principal products in our Ethanol Division are fuel-grade ethanol and distillers grains. In addition, we are extracting corn oil and capturing a portion of the raw carbon dioxide we produce for sale. The table below shows the approximate percentage of our total ethanol division revenue which is attributed to each of our products for each of our last three fiscal years. 
 Product Fiscal Year 2021 Fiscal Year 2020 Fiscal Year 2019 Ethanol 77 75 77 Distillers Grains 18 20 19 Corn Oil 5 5 4 Carbon Dioxide 
 Ethanol 
 
 Our primary product is ethanol. Ethanol is ethyl alcohol, a fuel component made primarily from corn and various other grains. The ethanol we produce is manufactured from corn. Although the ethanol industry continues to explore production technologies employing various feedstocks, such as biomass, corn-based production technologies remain the most practical and provide the lowest operating risks. Corn produces large quantities of carbohydrates, which convert into glucose more easily than most other kinds of biomass. 
 
 An ethanol plant is essentially a fermentation plant. Ground corn and water are mixed with enzymes and yeast to produce a substance called beer, which contains about 10 alcohol and 90 water. The beer is boiled to separate the water, resulting in ethyl alcohol, which is then dehydrated to increase the alcohol content. This product is then mixed with a certified denaturant to make the product unfit for human consumption and commercially saleable. 
 
 Ethanol can be used as: (i) an octane enhancer in fuels; (ii) an oxygenated fuel additive for the purpose of reducing ozone and carbon monoxide emissions; and (iii) a non-petroleum-based gasoline substitute. Approximately 95 of all ethanol is used in its primary form for blending with unleaded gasoline and other fuel products. Used as a fuel oxygenate, ethanol provides a means to control carbon monoxide emissions in large metropolitan areas. The principal purchasers of ethanol are generally the wholesale gasoline marketer or blender. The principal markets for our ethanol are petroleum terminals in the northeastern United States. 
 
 Distillers Grains 
 
 The principal co-product of the ethanol production process is distillers grains, a high protein, high-energy animal feed supplement primarily marketed to the dairy, beef, poultry and swine industries. Dry mill ethanol processing creates three forms of distillers grains: Distillers Wet Grains with Solubles ("DWS"), Distillers Modified Wet Grains with Solubles ("DMWS") and Distillers Dried Grains with Solubles ("DDGS"). DWS is processed corn mash that contains approximately 70 moisture. DWS has a shelf life of approximately three days and can be sold only to farms within the immediate vicinity of an ethanol plant. DMWS is DWS that has been dried to approximately 50 moisture. DMWS have a slightly longer shelf life of approximately ten days and are often sold to nearby markets. DDGS is DWS that has been dried to 10 to 12 moisture.

Table of Contents 

DDGS has an almost indefinite shelf life and may be sold and shipped to any market regardless of its vicinity to an ethanol plant. 
 
 Corn Oil 
 
 Since November 2008, we have been separating some of the corn oil contained in our distillers grains for sale. We have worked hard to improve corn oil production levels and continue to fine tune the operation of our equipment to further increase production rates. The corn oil that we produce is not food grade corn oil and therefore cannot be used for human consumption. However, corn oil can be used as the feedstock to produce biodiesel, as a feed ingredient and has other industrial uses. 
 
 Carbon Dioxide 
 
 Since March 2010, we have been selling some of the carbon dioxide gas produced at the plant. 
 
 Ethanol, Distillers Grains, Carbon Dioxide and Corn Oil Markets 
 
 As described below in " Distribution Methods ," we market and distribute our ethanol and distillers grains through third parties. Our ethanol and distillers grains marketers make all decisions, in consultation with management, with regard to where our products are marketed. Our ethanol and distillers grains are predominately sold in the domestic market. Specifically, we ship a substantial portion of the ethanol we produce to the New York harbor. We expect our ethanol and distillers grains marketers to explore all markets for our products, including export markets, and believe that there is potential for increased international sales of our products. However, due to high transportation costs, and the fact that we are not located near a major international shipping port, we expect a large portion of our products to be marketed and sold domestically. In addition, export demand is typically more unpredictable than domestic demand and tends to fluctuate over time as it is subject to monetary and political forces in other nations. 
 
 Canada, India and South Korea were top destinations for ethanol exports during the past year. Exports of ethanol for this period decreased compared to the same period last year. Tariffs implemented by Brazil and China on ethanol imported from the United States continue to reduce export demand from these markets. Trade barriers with key markets may continue to take a toll on ethanol export demand which could negatively affect domestic ethanol prices. The COVID-19 pandemic also continues to create uncertainty as to future export demand. 
 
 Historically, the United States ethanol industry exported a significant amount of distillers grains to China. The imposition of anti-dumping and anti-subsidy duties by China over the past four years effectively closed the Chinese market requiring United States producers to seek out alternatives. Mexico, South Korea and Vietnam have recently been top destinations for distillers grains exports. Exports of distillers grains increased during 2021 due to increases in exportable supply for the period compared to 2020. 
 
 As described below in " Distribution Methods ," we sell carbon dioxide to Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. ("Air Products") and we market and distribute all of the corn oil we produce directly to end users and third party brokers in the domestic market. 
 
 Distribution Methods 
 
 Our ethanol plant is located near Union City, Indiana in Randolph County. We selected the site because of its proximity to existing ethanol consumption and accessibility to road and rail transportation. Our site is in close proximity to rail and major highways that connect to major population centers such as Indianapolis, Cincinnati, Columbus, Cleveland, Toledo, Detroit, New York and Chicago. 
 
 Ethanol 
 
 We entered into an Ethanol Purchase and Sale Agreement with Murex, LLC ("Murex") for the purpose of marketing and distributing all of the ethanol we produce at the plant. The initial term of the agreement was five years commencing on the date of first delivery of ethanol with automatic renewal for one year terms thereafter unless otherwise terminated by either party. The agreement may be terminated due to the insolvency or intentional misconduct of either party or upon the default of one of the parties as set forth in the agreement. 
 6 

Table of Contents 

Under the terms of the agreement, Murex markets all of our ethanol unless we choose to sell a portion at a retail fueling station owned by us or one of our affiliates. Murex pays to us the purchase price invoiced to the third-party purchaser less all resale costs, taxes paid by Murex and Murex's commission. Murex has agreed to purchase on its own account and at market price any ethanol which it is unable to sell to a third party purchaser. Murex has promised to use its best efforts to obtain the best purchase price available for our ethanol. In addition, Murex has agreed to promptly notify us of any and all price arbitrage opportunities. Under the agreement, Murex is responsible for all transportation arrangements for the distribution of our ethanol. This agreement provides for an annual cap on the commission paid to Murex. Effective November 18, 2018, we further amended our agreement to provide for the payment of the commission to Murex to be calculated on each net gallon of ethanol taken under the agreement. The amendment provides that Murex will handle all RIN activity, submit regulatory reports, and lease us a minimum number of tank cars for rail transportation and manage the tank car fleet in exchange for a monthly payment. The amendment also extends the term of the agreement until November 30, 2022, to be renewed thereafter automatically for one-year periods unless either party gives notice of non-renewal at least 90 days prior to the end of the current term. 
 Distillers Grains 
 We have entered into an agreement with CHS, Inc. to market all distillers grains we produce at the plant. CHS, Inc. is a diversified energy, grains and foods company owned by farmers, ranchers and cooperatives. CHS, Inc. provides products and services ranging from grain marketing to food processing to meet the needs of its customers around the world. We receive a percentage of the selling price actually received by CHS, Inc. in marketing our distillers grains to its customers. The agreement remains in effect unless otherwise terminated by either party with 120 days notice. Under the agreement, CHS, Inc. is responsible for all transportation arrangements for the distribution of our distillers grains. 
 Corn Oil 
 We market and distribute all of the corn oil we produce directly to end users and third party brokers. Our corn oil is mainly used as an animal feed ingredient and as a feedstock in biodiesel production. 
 Carbon Dioxide 
 Air Products purchases a portion of the carbon dioxide gas produced at our plant. We entered into a Carbon Dioxide Purchase and Sale Agreement with Air Products under which Air Products was obligated to purchase a minimum of 98,700 tons of carbon dioxide gas. In addition, we executed a Site Lease Agreement with Air Products under which Air Products leased a portion of our property, on which it is operating a carbon dioxide liquefaction plant. On November 26, 2019, we sent written notice of termination of the Carbon Dioxide Purchase and Sale Agreement and Site Lease Agreement which was to be effective on June 1, 2020. However, due to disruptions related to COVID-19, the Company and Air Products agreed to rescind the terminations and extend the agreements one year to June 1, 2021. Effective June 1, 2021, we amended the agreement with Air Products. The amendment extended the initial term of the agreement to May 31, 2026 with automatic one-year renewal periods thereafter unless terminated by either party by providing at least six months written notice prior to the expiration of the term. The amendment increased the price paid for carbon dioxide subject to a price adjustment in the event of a take or pay shortfall. The amendment also provided that we may do anything we wish with excess carbon dioxide gas produced provided that if the excess is sold to competitors of Air Products then Air Products' annual take or pay obligation will be reduced accordingly and Air Products has the option to terminate the Agreement upon 90 days written notice. In addition, the amendment provides that, after the three year anniversary, we may terminate the agreement upon the occurrence of a Change of Control Event as defined in the amendment or if we decide to sequester our carbon dioxide. 
 Federal Ethanol Supports and Governmental Regulation 
 
 Federal Ethanol Supports 
 
 The ethanol industry is dependent on several economic incentives to produce ethanol. One significant federal ethanol support is the Federal Renewable Fuels Standard (the RFS ). The RFS requires that in each year, a certain amount of renewable fuels must be used in the United States. The RFS is a national program that does not require that any renewable fuels be used in any particular area or state, allowing refiners to use renewable fuel blends in those areas where it is most cost-effective. The RFS statutory volume requirement increases incrementally each year until the United States is required to use 36 billion gallons of renewable fuels by 2022. Starting in 2009, the RFS required that a portion of the RFS must be met by certain advanced renewable fuels. These advanced renewable fuels include ethanol that is not made from corn, such as cellulosic ethanol and biomass based biodiesel. The use of these advanced renewable fuels increases each year as a percentage of the total renewable fuels required to be used in the United States. 
 7 

Table of Contents 

The United States Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA") has the authority to waive the RFS statutory volume requirement, in whole or in part, provided one of the following two conditions have been met: (1) there is inadequate domestic renewable fuel supply; or (2) implementation of the requirement would severely harm the economy or environment of a state, region or the United States. Annually, the EPA is required by statute to pass a rule that establishes the number of gallons of different types of renewable fuels that must be used in the United States which is called the renewable volume obligation. The statutory volumes and the EPA's volumes for 2019 and 2020 (in billion gallons) are as follows: 
 Total Renewable Fuel Volume Requirement Portion of Volume Requirement That Can Be Met By Corn-based Ethanol 2019 Statutory 28.00 15.00 EPA Rule 11/30/2018 19.92 15.00 2020 Statutory 30.00 15.00 EPA Rule 12/19/2019 20.09 15.00 
 
 The EPA has not yet released the proposed rules to set the renewable volume obligation for 2021 and 2022. 
 
 Small refineries can petition the EPA annually for an exemption from their ethanol use requirements for the prior compliance year. The EPA granted significantly more small refinery waivers in 2018 and 2019 than in past years and did not reallocate the waived gallons to other refiners. These actions resulted in decreased ethanol demand which led to reduced market ethanol prices and negative operating margins in the ethanol industry. In January 2020, the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that small refinery exemptions may only be granted to refineries that had secured them continuously each year since 2010. Consistent with this ruling, in September 2020, the EPA denied certain small refinery exemption petitions filed by oil refineries in 2020 seeking retroactive relief from their ethanol use requirements for prior years. In June 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court reversed the decision finding that a small refinery may obtain a hardship exemption even if its earlier exemption had lapsed in one or more previous years. It is unclear at this point what impact this decision will have on the RFS and the Biden administration's management of the program. 
 
 In February 2010, the EPA issued new regulations governing the RFS. These new regulations have been called RFS2. Specifically, the EPA adopted rules to determine which renewable fuels provided sufficient reductions in green house gases, compared to conventional gasoline, to qualify under the RFS program. RFS2 establishes a tiered approach, where regular renewable fuels are required to accomplish a 20 green house gas reduction compared to gasoline, advanced biofuels and biomass-based biodiesel must accomplish a 50 reduction in green house gases, and cellulosic biofuels must accomplish a 60 reduction in green house gases. Any fuels that fail to meet this standard cannot be used by fuel blenders to satisfy their obligations under the RFS program. However, RFS2 as adopted by the EPA provides that corn-based ethanol from modern ethanol production processes meets the definition of a renewable fuel under the RFS program. Our ethanol plant was grandfathered into the RFS up to 115,000,000 gallons annually due to the fact that it was constructed prior to the effective date of the lifecycle green house gas requirement. Therefore, we are not required to prove compliance with the lifecycle green house gas reductions for a significant amount of our production. Certain provisions of RFS2 as adopted may disproportionately benefit ethanol produced from sugarcane. This could make sugarcane based ethanol, which is primarily produced in Brazil, more competitive in the United States ethanol market. 
 
 Most ethanol that is used in the United States is sold in a blend called E10. E10 is a blend of 10 ethanol and 90 gasoline. E10 is approved for use in all standard vehicles. In 2020, gasoline demand in the United States was approximately 124 billion gallons. Assuming that all gasoline in the United States is blended at a rate of 10 ethanol and 90 gasoline, the maximum demand for ethanol in 2020 was 12.4 billion gallons per year. This is commonly referred to as the blending wall, which represents a theoretical limit where more ethanol cannot be blended into the national gasoline pool. This is a theoretical limit because it is believed that it would not be possible to blend ethanol into every gallon of gasoline that is being used in the United States and it discounts the possibility of additional ethanol used in higher percentage blends. Gasoline demand is estimated to increase for 2021 rebounding from COVID-19 shutdowns. 
 
 In June 2012, the EPA gave final approval for the sale of E15, gasoline which is blended at a rate of 15 ethanol and 85 gasoline, for use in vehicles manufactured in the model year 2001 and later. Although there have been significant steps towards introduction of E15 in the marketplace, there are still obstacles to meaningful market penetration by E15. Many states still have regulatory issues that hamper or prevent the sale of E15. In addition, sales of E15 may be limited because E15 is not approved for use in all vehicles, the EPA requires a label that may discourage consumers from using E15, and retailers may choose not to sell E15 due to concerns regarding liability. Previously, different gasoline blendstocks were required at certain 
 8 

Table of Contents 

times of the year due to federal regulations related to fuel evaporative emissions which prevented E15 from being used during certain times of the year in various states. In May of 2019, the EPA issued a final rule allowing the year-round sale of E15. However in June 2021, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia struck down this rule finding that the EPA exceeded its authority. 
 
 A blender pump is a gasoline pump that can dispense a variety of different ethanol/gasoline blends. Blender pumps typically can dispense E10, E20, E30, E40, E50 and E85. These blender pumps accomplish these different ethanol/gasoline blends by internally mixing ethanol and gasoline which are held in separate tanks at the retail gas stations. Many in the ethanol industry believe that increased use of blender pumps will increase demand for ethanol by allowing gasoline retailers to provide various mid-level ethanol blends in a cost effective manner and allowing consumers with flex-fuel vehicles to purchase more ethanol through these mid-level blends. However, the expense of blender pumps has delayed their availability in the retail gasoline market. 
 
 In May 2020, the United States Department of Agriculture ("USDA") announced the Higher Blends Infrastructure Incentive Program which consists of up to 100 million in funding for grants to be used to increase the availability of higher blends of ethanol and biodiesel fuels. Funds may be awarded to retailers such as fueling stations and convenience stores to assist in the cost of installation or upgrading of fuel pumps and other infrastructure. In October 2020, the USDA announced the first round of awards to recipients of 22 million worth of grants. To date, the USDA has awarded approximately 66.4 million to eligible projects. 
 
 Effect of Governmental Regulation 
 
 The government's regulation of the environment changes constantly. We are subject to extensive air, water and other environmental regulations and we have been required to obtain a number of environmental permits to construct and operate the plant. It is possible that more stringent federal or state environmental rules or regulations could be adopted, which could increase our operating costs and expenses. It also is possible that federal or state environmental rules or regulations could be adopted that could have an adverse effect on the use of ethanol. For example, changes in the environmental regulations regarding the required oxygen content of automobile emissions could have an adverse effect on the ethanol industry. Plant operations are governed by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration OSHA ). OSHA regulations may change such that the costs of operating the plant may increase. Any of these regulatory factors may result in higher costs or other adverse conditions affecting our operations, cash flows and financial performance. 
 
 In late 2009, California passed a Low Carbon Fuels Standard ("LCFS"). The California LCFS requires that renewable fuels used in California must accomplish certain reductions in greenhouse gases which is measured using a lifecycle analysis, similar to the RFS. On December 29, 2011, a federal district court in California ruled that the California LCFS was unconstitutional which halted implementation of the California LCFS. However, the California Air Resources Board ("CARB") appealed this court ruling and on September 18, 2013, the federal appellate court reversed the federal district court finding the LCFS constitutional and remanding the case back to federal district court to determine whether the LCFS imposes a burden on interstate commerce that is excessive in light of the local benefits. On June 30, 2014, the United States Supreme Court declined to hear the appeal of the federal appellate court ruling and CARB recently re-adopted the LCFS with some slight modifications. The LCFS could have a negative impact on demand for corn-based ethanol and result in decreased ethanol prices affecting our ability to operate profitably. 
 
 We have obtained all of the necessary permits to operate the plant. In the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021, we incurred costs and expenses of approximately 122,000 complying with environmental laws. Although we have been successful in obtaining all of the permits currently required, any retroactive change in environmental regulations, either at the federal or state level, could require us to obtain additional or new permits or spend considerable resources in complying with such regulations.

Table of Contents 

We are subject to regulation by many governmental agencies, both federal and state. The chart below refers to some of the most important agencies and the areas of regulation. 
 
 Agency Area of Regulation U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Environmental Discharge and Renewable Volume Obligations Indiana Department of Environmental Management Air Permit and Environmental Discharge Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau Regulation of Alcohol Fuel and Distilled Spirits Permit Federal Railroad Administration Shipments Via Rail of Hazardous Material U.S. Department of Agriculture Food Safety Modernization Act Indiana Department of Agriculture Grain Procurement U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration Workplace Safety U.S. Department of Labor Wage and Hour U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Employment Eligibilty of Alien Workers U.S. Securities Exchange Commission Public Reporting of Financial Related Information U.S. Internal Revenue Service Tax Policy Commodities Futures Trading Commission Dodd-Frank and Commodities Trading 
 
 If any of these agencies find us in violation of any regulation, we could incur significant penalties and other economic disadvantages, including loss of permission to operate. 
 
 Competition 
 
 Ethanol 
 
 We are in direct competition with numerous ethanol producers, several of whom have greater resources than we do. Following the significant growth during 2005 and 2006, the ethanol industry has grown at a much slower pace. The Renewable Fuels Association estimates that there are approximately 202 ethanol production facilities in the United States with capacity to produce approximately 17.5 billion gallons of ethanol. 
 
 Since ethanol is a commodity product, competition in the industry is predominantly based on price. We have also experienced increased competition from oil companies who have purchased ethanol production facilities. These oil companies are required to blend a certain amount of ethanol each year. Therefore, the oil companies may be able to operate their ethanol production facilities at times when it is unprofitable for us to operate. Larger ethanol producers may be able to realize economies of scale that we are unable to realize. This could put us at a competitive disadvantage to other ethanol producers. The ethanol industry is continuing to consolidate where a few larger ethanol producers are increasing their production capacities and are controlling a larger portion of the United States ethanol production. Further, some ethanol producers own multiple ethanol plants which may allow them to compete more effectively by providing them flexibility to run certain production facilities while they have other facilities shut down. This added flexibility may allow these ethanol producers to compete more effectively, especially during periods when operation margins are unfavorable in the ethanol industry. 
 
 Following the acquisition of several plants by POET Biorefining from Flint Hills Resources earlier this year, the largest ethanol producers now include Archer Daniels Midland, Green Plains Renewable Energy, POET Biorefining and Valero Renewable Fuels, each of which are capable of producing significantly more ethanol than we produce.

Table of Contents 

The following table identifies the majority of the largest ethanol producers in the United States along with their production capacities.

 million gallons per year (mmgy) or more 
 Company Current Capacity (mmgy) POET Biorefining 2,648 Valero Renewable Fuels 1,730 Archer Daniels Midland 1,674 Green Plains Renewable Energy 1,039 
 
 The ethanol industry in the United States experienced increased competition from ethanol produced outside of the United States during 2012 which was likely the result of the expiration of the tariff on imported ethanol which expired on December 31, 2011. Although ethanol imports have since decreased, if competition from ethanol imports were to increase again that could negatively impact demand for ethanol produced in the United States which could result in lower operating margins. 
 
 Our ethanol plant also competes with producers of other gasoline additives having similar octane and oxygenate values as ethanol. Alternative fuels, gasoline oxygenates and alternative ethanol production methods are also continually under development. The major oil companies have significantly greater resources than we have to market other additives, to develop alternative products, and to influence legislation and public perception of ethanol. These companies also have sufficient resources to begin production of ethanol should they choose to do so. 
 
 A number of automotive, industrial and power generation manufacturers are developing alternative clean power systems using fuel cells, plug-in hybrids, electric cars or clean burning gaseous fuels. Electric car technology has recently grown in popularity, especially in urban areas. While in the past there were a limited number of vehicle recharging stations, making electric cars not feasible for all consumers, there has been an increased focus on developing these recharging stations which have made electric car technology more widely available. This additional competition from alternate sources could reduce the demand for ethanol, which would negatively impact our profitability. 
 
 Distillers Grains 
 
 Ethanol plants in the Midwest produce the majority of distillers grains and primarily compete with other ethanol producers in the production and sales of distillers grains. Ethanol plants produced approximately 33.1 million metric tons of distillers grains in 2020. 
 
 The primary consumers of distillers grains are dairy and beef cattle. In recent years, an increasing amount of distillers grains have been used in the swine and poultry markets. Numerous feeding trials show advantages in milk production, growth, rumen health, and palatability over other dairy cattle feeds. With the advancement of research into the feeding rations of poultry and swine, we expect these markets to expand and create additional demand for distillers grains; however, no assurance can be given that these markets will in fact expand, or if they do, that we will benefit from it. The market for distillers grains is generally confined to locations where freight costs allow it to be competitively priced against other feed ingredients. Distillers grains compete with three other feed formulations: soybean meal, corn gluten feed, dry brewers grain and mill feeds. The primary value of these products as animal feed is their protein content. Soybean meal, dry brewers grain and distillers grains have about the same protein content, and corn gluten feed and mill feeds have slightly lower protein contents. 
 Sources and Availability of Raw Materials 
 The major raw material required for our ethanol plant to produce ethanol, distillers grain and corn oil is corn. To produce 135 million gallons of ethanol per year, our ethanol plant needs approximately 47 million bushels of corn per year, or approximately 129,000 bushels per day, as the feedstock for its dry milling process. Traditionally, corn grown in the area of the plant site has been fed locally to livestock or exported for feeding or processing and/or overseas export sales. 
 
 The price at which we purchase corn will depend on prevailing market prices. We are significantly dependent on the availability and price of corn. The price and availability of corn are subject to significant fluctuations depending upon a number 
 11 

Table of Contents 

of factors affecting grain commodity prices in general, including crop conditions, weather, governmental programs and foreign purchases. Because the market price of ethanol is not directly related to grain prices, ethanol producers are generally not able to compensate for increases in the cost of grain feedstock through adjustments in prices charged for their ethanol. We therefore anticipate that our plant's profitability will be negatively impacted during periods of high grain prices. 
 In an attempt to minimize the effects of the volatility of corn costs on operating profits, we take hedging positions in corn futures markets. Hedging means protecting the price at which we buy corn and the price at which we will sell our products in the future. It is a way to attempt to reduce the risk caused by price fluctuation. The effectiveness of hedging activities is dependent upon, among other things, the cost of corn and our ability to sell sufficient amounts of ethanol and distillers grains to utilize all of the corn subject to the futures contracts. Hedging activities can result in costs to us because price movements in grain contracts are highly volatile and are influenced by many factors beyond our control. These costs may be significant. 
 
 High corn prices have a negative effect on our operating margins unless the price of ethanol and distillers grains out paces rising corn prices. Corn prices were higher during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021, compared to the same period in 2020 due primarily to concerns related to the COVID-19 pandemic. On October 12, 2021, the USDA released a report estimating the 2021 corn crop in the United States at approximately 15 billion bushels, up 6 from last year's production, with yields averaging 176.5 bushels per acre. The USDA forecasted area harvested for grain at 93.3 million acres, up 3 from 2020. The Indiana corn crop is estimated to be approximately 1 billion bushels, up approximately 4 from 2020. Yields in Indiana are expected to be approximately 194 bushels per acre, up approximately 4 from 2020. Management will continue to monitor the availability of corn in our area. 
 
 Utilities 
 
 We engaged Capstone Energy Services, LLC ("Capstone") to provide us with on-going energy management services. Capstone manages the procurement and delivery of energy to our location. They assist with strategy development, cost analysis, risk management, supply management and reporting services in exchange for a monthly fee. The agreement commenced on June 1, 2015, and continues for one year unless earlier terminated due to an event of default. Following the expiration of the initial one-year term, the agreement will be on a month-to-month basis and may be terminated by either party upon sixty days prior written notice. 
 Natural Gas 
 
 Natural gas is also an important input commodity to our manufacturing process. Our natural gas usage for our fiscal year ended September 30, 2021 was 5.7 more MMBTUs than for last fiscal year, constituting 3.4 of our total costs of goods sold. We are using natural gas to produce process steam and to dry our distillers grain products to a moisture content at which they can be stored for long periods of time, and can be transported greater distances, so that we can market the product to broader livestock markets, including poultry and swine markets in the continental United States. 
 
 On March 20, 2007, we entered into a Long-Term Transportation Service Contract for Redelivery of Natural Gas with Ohio Valley Gas Corporation ("Ohio Valley"). Under the contract, Ohio Valley receives, transports and redelivers natural gas to us for all of our natural gas requirements up to a maximum of 100,000 therms per purchase gas day and our estimated annual natural gas requirements of 34,000,000 therms. For all gas received for and redelivered to us by Ohio Valley, we pay a throughput rate in the amount of 0.0138 per therm for the first five years of the contract term, and 0.0138 increased by the compounded inflation rate as established and determined by the U.S. Consumer Price Index - All Urban Consumers for Transportation for the following five years. In addition, we pay a service charge for all gas received for and redelivered to us by Ohio Valley in the amount of 750 per delivery meter per billing cycle per month for the first five years of the contract term and 750 increased by the compounded inflation rate over the initial rate as established and determined by the U.S. Consumer Price Index - All Urban Consumers for Transportation for the following five years. The initial term of the contract was ten years. Provided neither party terminates the contract, the contract will automatically renew for a series of not more than three consecutive one year periods. 
 
 Electricity 
 
 We require a significant amount of electrical power to operate the plant. On May 2, 2007, we entered into an agreement with Indiana Michigan Power Company to furnish our electric energy. The initial term of the contract was 30 months from the time service is commenced and continues thereafter unless terminated by either party with 12 months written notice. We pay Indiana Michigan Power Company monthly pursuant to their standard rates.

Table of Contents 

Water 
 
 We require a significant supply of water. Engineering specifications show our plant's water requirements to be approximately 774 gallons per minute, 1.1 million gallons per day, depending on the quality of water. We have assessed our water needs and available supply and have determined that we have an adequate supply. Union City Water Works is supplying the water necessary to operate our plant. 
 
 Recycling water back into the process minimizes discharge water. This will have the long-term effect of lowering wastewater treatment costs. Our plant design incorporates the ICM/Phoenix Bio-Methanator wastewater treatment process resulting in a zero discharge of plant process water. There are, however, certain areas of production where fresh water is needed. 
 
 Patents, Trademarks, Licenses, Franchises and Concessions 
 
 We do not currently hold any patents, trademarks, franchises or concessions. We were granted a license by ICM, Inc. to use certain ethanol production technology necessary to operate our ethanol plant. The cost of the license granted by ICM, Inc. was included in the amount we paid to Fagen, Inc. to design and build our ethanol plant. In addition, we were granted a license by ICM, Inc. to use certain corn oil technologies necessary to extract corn oil during our plant operations. 
 
 Seasonality of Ethanol Sales 
 
 We experience some seasonality of demand for ethanol. Since ethanol is predominantly blended with conventional gasoline for use in automobiles, ethanol demand tends to shift in relation to gasoline demand. As a result, we experience some seasonality of demand for ethanol in the summer months related to increased driving. In addition, we experience some increased ethanol demand during holiday seasons related to increased gasoline demand. 
 
 Dependence on One or a Few Major Customers 
 
 As discussed above, we have entered into a marketing agreement with Murex for the purpose of marketing and distributing our ethanol and have engaged CHS, Inc. for the purpose of marketing and distributing our distillers grains. We rely on Murex for the sale and distribution of our ethanol and CHS, Inc. for the sale and distribution of our distillers grains. Therefore, although there are other marketers in the industry, we are highly dependent on Murex and CHS, Inc. for the successful marketing of our products. Any loss of Murex or CHS, Inc. as our marketing agent for our ethanol and distillers grains, respectively, could have a significant negative impact on our revenues. 
 
 Trading Division 
 
 We procure, transport and sell grain commodities through our Trading Division, which began operations at the end of our fourth fiscal quarter of 2017. 
 
 Principal Products 
 
 We have and expect to continue to buy primarily soybeans and corn from producers relying principally on forward purchase contracts to ensure an adequate supply of grain. However, we occasionally also purchase grain the day of delivery. Grain prices are typically comprised of futures prices on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange ("CME") and local basis adjustments. 
 
 Grain Markets and Distribution Methods 
 
 Grain shipments are made by rail and truck. Our sales are made to grain processors and export markets in the southeastern United States. Our grain sales are generally made by contract for delivery in a future period. Income is expected to be earned on grain bought and sold, the appreciation or depreciation in the basis value of the grain held and the appreciation or depreciation between the futures contract months. 
 
 Competition 
 
 We primarily compete in the purchase of grain on a local or regional basis although there are some larger national and international companies that maintain regional grain purchase and storage facilities. We compete in the sale of grain with other 
 13 

Table of Contents 

public and private grain brokers, elevator operators and farmer owned cooperatives. Competition is based primarily on price, service and reliability. 
 
 Seasonality of Grain Purchases and Sales 
 
 Our grain operations are somewhat seasonal in nature in that the grain we procure is harvested in October and November. The largest portion of the grain is delivered by producers in the fall although we buy and sell a significant portion of our grain throughout the year. 
 
 Risk Management 
 
 We manage the futures price risk of changing commodity prices by entering into exchange-traded futures contracts on the CME. The CME is a regulated commodity futures exchange that maintains futures markets for the grain we trade. Futures prices are determined by worldwide supply and demand. 
 
 We entered into a Risk Management Agreement with John Stewart Associates ("JS A") under which JS A provides risk management and related services pertaining to grain hedging, grain pricing information, aid in purchase of grain, and assistance in risk management as it pertains to ethanol, co-products and soybeans. In exchange for JS A's risk management services, we pay JS A a fee of 1,500 per month. We are currently on a month to month basis for this contract with JS A. The agreement may be terminated by either party at any time upon written notice. 
 
 We also entered into an agreement with Advance Trading to assist us with hedging corn, ethanol, natural gas and soybeans. We pay them a fee of 3,000 per month for these services. The term of the agreement is month-to-month and may be terminated by either party at any time upon proper notice. 
 
 We also entered into an agreement with Commodity Ingredient Hedging, LLC to evaluate and provide marketing advice and margin management related to cash sales and purchases, forward contracts and exchange-traded futures and options. We pay an annual fee of 12,000 in exchange for these services. The agreement automatically renews for additional one year terms unless either party gives written notice of non-renewal as provided in the agreement. 
 
 Employees 
 
 We have 58 full-time employees as of November 19, 2021. We employ individuals in the local region around our one facility. Many of our employees require some technical or professional background and we compete for them via wages and benefits. We attract them from schools and colleges within our region, which are numerous. There are several other ethanol plants within a fifty mile radius of our facility. Individuals with ethanol specific skills are available to us because of this proximity. However, this competition for resources also presents a challenge in retaining those with specialized skills. 
 
 Working Capital 
 
 We primarily use our working capital for purchases of raw materials necessary to operate the Ethanol Division and for purchases of grain commodities for the Trading Division. Our primary sources of working capital is cash we generate from our operations along with our Declining Loan and our Revolving Credit Loan with our primary lender First National Bank of Omaha. The Declining Loan provides 5,000,000 in total for us to use on capital projects allowing us to preserve our working capital at a sufficient level. At September 30, 2021, we have approximately 20,000,000 available to draw on the Revolving Credit Loan to provide additional working capital. We will discuss the Declining Loan and Revolving Loan in more detail in "Item 7- Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" . 

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 
 
 You should carefully read and consider the risks and uncertainties below and the other information contained in this report. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we may face. The following risks, together with additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial could impair our financial condition and results of operation. 
 
 Risks Relating to Our Business 
 
 Our existing debt financing agreements contain, and our future debt financing agreements may contain, restrictive covenants that limit distributions and impose restrictions on the operation of our business. The use of debt financing makes 
 14 

Table of Contents 

it more difficult for us to operate because we must make principal and interest payments on the indebtedness and abide by covenants contained in our debt financing agreements. Although we have significantly reduced our level of debt, the restrictive covenants contained in our financing agreements may have important implications on our operations, including, among other things: (a) limiting our ability to obtain additional debt or equity financing; (b) subjecting all or substantially all of our assets to liens; and (c) limiting our ability to make business and operational decisions regarding our business, including, among other things making capital improvements and selling or purchasing assets or engaging in transactions we deem to be appropriate and in our best interest. 
 
 Failures of our information technology infrastructure could have a material adverse effect on operations. We utilize various software applications and other information technology that are critically important to our business operations. We rely on information technology networks and systems, including the Internet, to process, transmit and store electronic and financial information, to manage a variety of business processes and activities, including production, manufacturing, financial, logistics, sales, marketing and administrative functions. We depend on our information technology infrastructure to communicate internally and externally with employees, customers, suppliers and others. We also use information technology networks and systems to comply with regulatory, legal and tax requirements. These information technology systems, some of which are managed by third parties, may be susceptible to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to failures during the process of upgrading or replacing software, databases or components thereof, power outages, hardware failures, computer viruses, attacks by computer hackers or other cybersecurity risks, telecommunication failures, user errors, natural disasters, terrorist attacks or other catastrophic events. If any of our significant information technology systems suffer severe damage, disruption or shutdown, and our disaster recovery and business continuity plans do not effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner, our product sales, financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected. 
 
 A cyber attack or other information security breach could have a material adverse effect on our operations and result in financial losses. We are regularly the target of attempted cyber and other security threats and must continuously monitor and develop our information technology networks and infrastructure to prevent, detect, address and mitigate the risk of unauthorized access, misuse, computer viruses and other events that could have a security impact. If we are unable to prevent cyber attacks and other information security breaches, we may encounter significant disruptions in our operations which could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations or result in the unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. Such breaches may also harm our reputation, result in financial losses or subject us to litigation or other costs or penalties. 
 
 We may violate the terms of our credit agreements and financial covenants which could result in our lender demanding immediate repayment of our loans. We were in compliance with all financial covenants at September 30, 2021. Current management projections indicate that we will be in compliance with our loan covenants through September 30, 2022. However, unforeseen circumstances may develop which could result in violations of our loan covenants. If we violate the terms of our credit agreement, our primary lender could deem us in default of our loans and require us to immediately repay any outstanding balance of our loans. 
 
 Our inability to maintain or secure credit facilities we may require in the future may negatively impact our liquidity. While we do not currently require more financing than we have, in the future we may need additional financing. If we require financing in the future and we are unable to secure such financing, or we are unable to secure the financing we require on reasonable terms, it may have a negative impact on our liquidity. This could negatively impact the value of our units. 
 
 We depend on our management and key employees, and the loss of these relationships could negatively impact our ability to operate profitably. We are highly dependent on our management team to operate our ethanol plant. We may not be able to replace these individuals should they decide to cease their employment with us, or if they become unavailable for any other reason. While we seek to compensate our management and key employees in a manner that will encourage them to continue their employment with us, they may choose to seek other employment. Any loss of these officers and key employees may prevent us from operating the ethanol plant profitably and could decrease the value of our units. 
 
 We are subject to global and regional economic downturns and related risks and the effects of COVID-19 or another pandemic may materially and adversely affect demand and the market price for our products. The level of demand for our products is affected by global and regional demographic and macroeconomic conditions. A significant downturn in global economic growth, or recessionary conditions in major geographic regions for prolonged periods, may lead to reduced demand for our products, which could have a negative effect on the market price of our products. In December 2019, a novel coronavirus surfaced in Wuhan, China COVID-19 ). The spread of COVID-19 worldwide resulted in businesses suspending or substantially curtailing global operations and travel, quarantines, and an overall substantial slowdown of economic activity. Transportation fuels in particular, including ethanol, experienced significant price declines and reduced demand. The effects of 
 15 

Table of Contents 

COVID-19 have and may continue to materially and adversely affect the market price for our products, our business, results of operations and liquidity. 
 
 COVID-19 or another pandemic may negatively impact our ability to operate our business which could decrease or eliminate the value of our units. COVID-19 resulted in significant uncertainty in many areas of our business. We do not know how long these conditions will last. This uncertainty is expected to negatively impact our operations. We may experience labor shortages if our employees are unable or unwilling to come to work. If our suppliers cannot deliver the supplies we need to operate our business or if we are unable to ship our products due to trucking or rail shipping disruptions, we may be forced to suspend operations or reduce production. If we are unable to operate the ethanol plant at capacity, it may result in unfavorable operating results. Any shut down of operations or reduction in production, especially for an extended period of time, could reduce or eliminate the value of our units. 
 
 Risks Related to our Trading Division 
 
 Our Trading Division business is affected by the supply and demand of commodities, and is sensitive to factors outside of our control. Adverse price movements could negatively affect our profitability and results of operations. Our Trading Division buys, sells and holds inventories of agricultural commodities, some of which are readily traded on commodity futures exchanges. Unfavorable weather conditions, both local and worldwide, as well as other factors beyond our control, can affect the supply and demand of these commodities and expose us to liquidity pressures to finance hedges in the grain business in rapidly rising markets. Increased costs of inventory and prices of raw material would decrease our profit margins and adversely affect our results of operations. While we attempt to manage the risk associated with commodity price changes for our grain inventory positions with derivative instruments, including purchase and sale contracts, we are unable to offset 100 of the price risk of each transaction due to timing, availability of futures and options contracts and third-party credit risk. Furthermore, there is a risk that the derivatives we employ will not be effective in offsetting all of the risks that we are trying to manage. This can happen when the derivative and the underlying value of grain inventories and purchase and sale contracts are not perfectly matched. Our grain derivatives, for example, do not perfectly correlate with the basis component of our grain inventory and contracts. (Basis is defined as the difference between the local cash price of a commodity and the corresponding exchange-traded futures price.) Differences can reflect time periods, locations or product forms. Although the basis component is smaller and generally less volatile than the futures component of our grain market price, basis moves on a large grain position can significantly impact the profitability of the Trading Division. Our futures, options and over-the-counter contracts are subject to margin calls. If there are large movements in the commodities market, we could be required to post significant levels of margin, which would impact our liquidity. There is no assurance that the efforts we have taken to mitigate the impact of the volatility of the prices of commodities upon which we rely will be successful and any sudden change in the price of these commodities could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. 
 
 We face intense competition in our Trading Division. We face significant competition in our Trading Division and we have numerous competitors, some of which are larger and have greater financial resources than we have. Competition could cause us to lose market share and talented employees, exit certain lines of business, increase marketing or other expenditures or reduce pricing, each of which could have an adverse effect on our business and profitability. 
 
 Our Trading Division uses derivative contracts to reduce volatility in the commodity markets. Non-performance by the counter-parties to those contracts could adversely affect our future results of operations and financial position. A significant amount of our commodity purchases and sales are done through forward contracting. In addition, we use exchange traded and to a lesser degree over-the-counter contracts to reduce volatility in changing commodity prices. A significant adverse change in commodity prices could cause a counter-party to one or more of our derivative contracts to not perform on their obligation. 
 
 If a substantial portion of our inventory becomes damaged or obsolete, its value would decrease and our profit margins would suffer. We may carry significant amounts of inventory in our Trading Division. The value of our inventories could decrease due to deterioration in the quality of our grain inventory due to damage, moisture, insects, disease or foreign material. If the quality of our grain were to deteriorate below an acceptable level, the value of our inventory could decrease significantly. 
 Risks Related to our Ethanol Division 
 Declines in the price of ethanol or distillers grain would significantly reduce our revenues. The sales prices of ethanol and distillers grains can be volatile as a result of a number of factors such as overall supply and demand, the price of gasoline and corn, levels of government support, and the availability and price of competing products. We are dependent on a favorable spread between the price we receive for our ethanol and distillers grains and the price we pay for corn and natural gas.

Table of Contents 

Any lowering of ethanol and distillers grains prices, especially if it is associated with increases in corn and natural gas prices, may affect our ability to operate profitably. We anticipate the price of ethanol and distillers grains to continue to be volatile in our 2021 fiscal year as a result of the net effect of changes in the price of gasoline and corn and increased ethanol supply offset by increased export demand. In addition, growing conditions in a particular season s harvest may cause the corn crop to be of poor quality resulting in corn shortages and a decrease in distillers grains prices. Declines in the prices we receive for our ethanol and distillers grains will lead to decreased revenues and may result in our inability to operate the ethanol plant profitably for an extended period of time which could decrease the value of our units. 
 
 Increases in the price of corn or natural gas would reduce our profitability. Our primary source of revenue is from the sale of ethanol, distillers grains and corn oil. Our results of operations and financial condition are significantly affected by the cost and supply of corn and natural gas. Changes in the price and supply of corn and natural gas are subject to and determined by market forces over which we have no control including weather and general economic factors. 
 
 Ethanol production requires substantial amounts of corn. Generally, higher corn prices will produce lower profit margins and, therefore, negatively affect our financial performance. If a period of high corn prices were to be sustained for some time, such pricing may reduce our ability to operate profitably because of the higher cost of operating our plant. We may not be able to offset any increase in the price of corn by increasing the price of our products. If we cannot offset increases in the price of corn, our financial performance may be negatively affected. 
 
 The prices for and availability of natural gas are subject to volatile market conditions. These market conditions often are affected by factors beyond our control such as higher prices as a result of colder than average weather conditions or natural disasters, overall economic conditions and foreign and domestic governmental regulations and relations. Significant disruptions in the supply of natural gas could impair our ability to manufacture ethanol and more significantly, distillers grains for our customers. Furthermore, increases in natural gas prices or changes in our natural gas costs relative to natural gas costs paid by competitors may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. We seek to minimize the risks from fluctuations in the prices of corn and natural gas through the use of hedging instruments. However, these hedging transactions also involve risks to our business. See Risks Relating to Our Business - We engage in hedging transactions which involve risks that could harm our business . If we were to experience relatively higher corn and natural gas costs compared to the selling prices of our products for an extended period of time, the value of our units may be reduced. 
 
 We engage in hedging transactions which involve risks that could harm our business. We are exposed to market risk from changes in commodity prices. Exposure to commodity price risk results from our dependence on corn and natural gas in the ethanol production process. We seek to minimize the risks from fluctuations in the prices of corn, natural gas and ethanol through the use of hedging instruments. The effectiveness of our hedging strategies is dependent on the price of corn, natural gas and ethanol and our ability to sell sufficient products to use all of the corn and natural gas for which we have futures contracts. Our hedging activities may not successfully reduce the risk caused by price fluctuation which may leave us vulnerable to high corn and natural gas prices. Alternatively, we may choose not to engage in hedging transactions in the future and our operations and financial conditions may be adversely affected during periods in which corn and/or natural gas prices increase. Utilizing cash for margin calls has an impact on the cash we have available for our operations which could result in liquidity problems during times when corn prices rise or fall significantly. 
 
 Price movements in corn, natural gas and ethanol contracts are highly volatile and are influenced by many factors that are beyond our control. There are several variables that could affect the extent to which our derivative instruments are impacted by price fluctuations in the cost of corn or natural gas. However, it is likely that commodity cash prices will have the greatest impact on the derivatives instruments with delivery dates nearest the current cash price. We may incur such costs and they may be significant which could impact our ability to profitably operate the plant and may reduce the value of our units. 
 
 Our Ethanol Division is not diversified. While we do procure, transport and sell grain commodities through our Trading Division, our success depends largely on our ability to profitably operate our ethanol plant. We do not have other significant sources of revenue if we are unable to operate our ethanol plant and manufacture ethanol, distillers grains, corn oil and carbon dioxide or if economic or political factors adversely affect the market for ethanol, distillers grains, corn oil or carbon dioxide. Our business would also be significantly harmed if the ethanol plant could not operate at full capacity for any extended period of time. 
 
 The ethanol industry is an industry that is changing rapidly which can result in unexpected developments that could negatively impact our operations and the value of our units. The ethanol industry has grown significantly in the last decade. This rapid growth has resulted in significant shifts in supply and demand of ethanol over a very short period of time. As a result, past performance by the ethanol plant or the ethanol industry generally might not be indicative of future performance. We may experience a rapid shift in the economic conditions in the ethanol industry which may make it difficult 
 17 

Table of Contents 

to operate the ethanol plant profitably. If changes occur in the ethanol industry that make it difficult for us to operate the ethanol plant profitably, it could result in a reduction in the value of our units. 
 
 Changes and advances in ethanol production technology could require us to incur costs to update our plant or could otherwise hinder our ability to compete in the ethanol industry or operate profitably. Advances and changes in the technology of ethanol production are expected to occur. Such advances and changes may make the ethanol production technology installed in our plant less desirable or obsolete. These advances could also allow our competitors to produce ethanol at a lower cost than we are able. If we are unable to adopt or incorporate technological advances, our ethanol production methods and processes could be less efficient than our competitors, which could cause our plant to become noncompetitive or completely obsolete. If our competitors develop, obtain or license technology that is superior to ours or that makes our technology obsolete, we may be required to incur significant costs to enhance or acquire new technology so that our ethanol production remains competitive. Alternatively, we may be required to seek third-party licenses, which could also result in significant expenditures. These third-party licenses may not be available or, once obtained, they may not continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms. These costs could negatively impact our financial performance by increasing our operating costs and reducing our net income. 
 
 Decreasing gasoline prices could negatively impact our ability to operate profitably . Discretionary blending is an important secondary market which is often determined by the price of ethanol versus the price of gasoline. In periods when discretionary blending is financially unattractive, the demand for ethanol may be reduced. Lower gasoline prices reduce the spread between the price of gasoline and the price of ethanol which can discourage discretionary blending, dampen the export market and result in a downwards market adjustment in the price of ethanol. If oil and gasoline prices were to remain low for a significant period of time, it could hurt our ability to profitably operate the ethanol plant which could decrease the value of our units. 
 
 Demand for ethanol may not grow unless ethanol can be blended into gasoline in higher percentage blends for conventional automobiles. Currently, ethanol is blended with conventional gasoline for use in standard (non-flex fuel) vehicles to create a blend which is 10 ethanol and 90 conventional gasoline. In order to expand demand for ethanol, higher percentage blends of ethanol must be utilized in conventional automobiles. Such higher percentage blends of ethanol have become a contentious issue with automobile manufacturers and environmental groups having fought against higher percentage ethanol blends. E15 is a blend which is 15 ethanol and 85 conventional gasoline. Although there have been significant developments towards the availability of E15 in the marketplace, there are still obstacles that could inhibit meaningful market penetration by E15. 
 
 Technology advances in the commercialization of cellulosic ethanol may decrease demand for corn based ethanol which may negatively affect our profitability. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 and the 2008 Farm Bill offer a very strong incentive to develop commercial scale cellulosic ethanol. The statutory volume requirement in the RFS requires that 16 billion gallons per year of advanced bio-fuels be consumed in the United States by 2022. If an efficient method of producing ethanol from cellulose-based biomass is developed, we may not be able to compete effectively. If we are unable to produce ethanol as cost-effectively as cellulose-based producers, our ability to generate revenue and our financial condition will be negatively impacted. 
 
 Decreasing ethanol prices could reduce our ability to operate profitably . Decreases in the price of ethanol reduce our revenue. Our profitability depends on a favorable spread between our corn and natural gas costs and the price we receive for our ethanol. If ethanol prices fall during times when corn and/or natural gas prices are high, we may not be able to operate our ethanol plant profitably. 
 
 If a substantial portion of our corn inventory becomes damaged or obsolete, its value would decrease and our profit margins would suffer. We may carry significant amounts of corn inventory in our Ethanol Division. The value of our inventories could decrease due to deterioration in the quality of our inventory due to damage, moisture, insects, disease or foreign material. If the quality of our corn inventory were to deteriorate below an acceptable level, the value of our inventory could decrease significantly. 
 
 We operate in an intensely competitive industry and compete with larger, better financed entities which could impact our ability to operate profitably. There is significant competition among ethanol producers. There are numerous producer-owned and privately-owned ethanol plants planned and operating throughout the Midwest and elsewhere in the United States. In addition, we have seen increased competition from oil companies who have purchased ethanol production facilities. We also face competition from outside of the United States. The largest ethanol producers include Archer Daniels Midland, Green Plains Renewable Energy, POET Biorefining and Valero Renewable Fuels, each of which is capable of producing significantly more ethanol than we produce. Further, many believe that there will be further consolidation occurring in the 
 18 

Table of Contents 

ethanol industry in the future which will likely lead to a few companies which control a significant portion of the ethanol production market. We may not be able to compete with these larger entities. These larger ethanol producers may be able to affect the ethanol market in ways that are not beneficial to us which could affect our financial performance. 
 
 Competition from the advancement of alternative fuels may lessen the demand for ethanol. Alternative fuels, gasoline oxygenates and ethanol production methods are continually under development. Like ethanol, these emerging technologies offer an option to address worldwide energy costs, the long-term availability of petroleum reserves and environmental concerns. If these alternative technologies continue to expand and gain broad acceptance and become readily available to consumers for motor vehicle use, we may not be able to compete effectively. This additional competition could reduce the demand for ethanol, resulting in lower ethanol prices that might adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. 
 
 Increased use of fuel cells, plug-in hybrids and electric cars may lessen the demand for ethanol. Automotive, industrial and power generation manufacturers have developed alternative clean power systems using fuel cells, plug-in hybrids, electric cars or clean burning gaseous fuels. Electric car technology has recently grown in popularity, especially in urban areas, which has led to an increase in recharging stations which has made electric car technology more widely available. This additional competition from alternate sources could reduce the demand for ethanol, resulting in lower ethanol prices which could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition. 
 
 Consumer resistance to the use of ethanol based on the belief that ethanol is expensive, uses too much corn, adds to air pollution, harms engines and/or takes more energy to produce than it contributes may affect the demand for ethanol. Certain individuals believe that use of ethanol will have a negative impact on gasoline prices at the pump and that ethanol uses too much of the available corn supply. Many also believe that ethanol adds to air pollution and harms car and truck engines. Still other consumers believe that the process of producing ethanol actually uses more fossil energy, such as oil and natural gas, than the amount of energy that is produced. These consumer beliefs could potentially be wide-spread and may be increasing as a result of recent efforts to increase the allowable percentage of ethanol that may be blended for use in conventional automobiles. If consumers choose not to buy ethanol based on these beliefs, it would affect the demand for the ethanol we produce which could negatively affect our profitability and financial condition. 
 
 Risks Related to Regulation and Governmental Action 
 
 Government incentives for ethanol production may be eliminated in the future, which could hinder our ability to operate at a profit . The ethanol industry is assisted by various federal ethanol production and tax incentives, including the RFS set forth in the Energy Policy Act of 2005. The RFS helps support a market for ethanol that might disappear without this incentive. The United States Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA") has the authority to waive the RFS statutory volume requirement, in whole or in part, provided certain conditions have been met. In addition, the EPA expanded its use of waivers to small refineries allowing those refineries to avoid their ethanol use requirements under the RFS resulting in decreased ethanol demand. If the EPA were to significantly reduce the volume requirements under the RFS or if the RFS were to be otherwise reduced or eliminated by the exercise of the EPA waiver authority or by Congress, the market price and demand for ethanol could decrease which will negatively impact our financial performance. 
 
 Government policies and regulations, particularly those affecting the agricultural sector and related industries, could adversely affect our operations and profitability. Agricultural commodity production and trade flows are significantly affected by government policies and regulations. Governmental policies affecting the agricultural industry, such as taxes, tariffs, duties, subsidies, import and export restrictions on agricultural commodities and commodity products can influence industry profitability, the planting of certain crops versus other uses of agricultural resources, the location and size of crop production, whether unprocessed or processed commodity products are traded and the volume and types of imports and exports. In addition, international trade disputes can adversely affect agricultural commodity trade flows by limiting or disrupting trade between countries or regions. Future governmental policies, regulations or actions affecting our industry may adversely affect the supply of, demand for and prices of our products, restrict our ability to do business and cause our financial results to suffer. 
 
 Reductions in distillers grains exports to China have a negative effect on the price of distillers grains in the U.S. and could negatively affect our profitability. China was the world's largest buyer of distillers grains produced in the United States. On January 12, 2016, the Chinese government began an anti-dumping and countervailing duty investigation related to distillers grains imported from the United States which contributed to a decline in distillers grains shipped to China. China began imposing anti-dumping and anti-subsidy duties during 2016 as a result of a preliminary ruling on its investigation. On January 10, 2017, China announced a final ruling related to its anti-dumping and countervailing duty investigation imposing anti-dumping duties from a range of 42.2 to 53.7 and anti-subsidy duties from 11.2 to 12.0 . The imposition of these duties has resulted in a significant decline in demand from this top importer and negatively impacted prices for distillers grains 
 19 

Table of Contents 

produced in the United States. This reduction in demand could negatively impact our ability to profitably operate the ethanol plant. 
 
 Reductions in ethanol exports to China due to the imposition of a tariff on U.S. ethanol have a negative impact on ethanol prices. China imposed a tariff on ethanol which is produced in the United States and exported to China which has negatively impacted exports of ethanol to China. The decrease could negatively impact the market price of ethanol in the United States and our ability to profitably operate the ethanol plant. 
 
 Reductions in ethanol exports to Brazil due to the imposition by the Brazilian government of a tariff on U.S. ethanol have a negative impact on ethanol prices. Brazil was historically a top destination for ethanol produced in the United States. However, Brazil imposed a tariff on ethanol which is produced in the United States and exported to Brazil. The tariff has resulted in a decline in demand for ethanol from Brazil and could negatively impact the market price of ethanol in the United States and our ability to profitably operate the ethanol plant. The effect of the tariff was previously mitigated somewhat by the adoption of a rate tariff quota that allowed 750 million liters of ethanol annually to be allowed into Brazil before the tariff applied. However, this rate tariff quota expired in December 2020. 
 
 Changes in environmental regulations or violations of these regulations could be expensive and reduce our profitability. We are subject to extensive air, water and other environmental laws and regulations. In addition, some of these laws require our plant to operate under a number of environmental permits. These laws, regulations and permits can often require expensive pollution control equipment or operational changes to limit actual or potential impacts to the environment. A violation of these laws and regulations or permit conditions can result in substantial fines, damages, criminal sanctions, permit revocations and/or plant shutdowns. In the future, we may be subject to legal actions brought by environmental advocacy groups and other parties for actual or alleged violations of environmental laws or our permits. Additionally, any changes in environmental laws and regulations, both at the federal and state level, could require us to spend considerable resources in order to comply with future environmental regulations. The expense of compliance could be significant enough to reduce our profitability and negatively affect our financial condition. 
 
 The California Low Carbon Fuel Standard may decrease demand for corn based ethanol which could negatively impact our profitability . California passed a Low Carbon Fuels Standard ("LCFS") which requires that renewable fuels used in California must accomplish certain reductions in greenhouse gases which reductions are measured using a lifecycle analysis. Management believes that these regulations could preclude corn based ethanol produced in the Midwest from being used in California. California represents a significant ethanol demand market. If the ethanol industry is unable to supply corn based ethanol to California, it could significantly reduce demand for the ethanol we produce. This could result in a reduction of our revenues and could negatively impact our ability to profitably operate the ethanol plant. 

ITEM 2. PROPERTIES 
 
 Our plant site is made up of two adjacent parcels which together total approximately 295 acres in east central Indiana near Union City, Indiana. The address of our plant is 1554 N. County Road 600 E., Union City, Indiana 47390. On October 31, 2016, we purchased approximately 64 acres of land adjacent to our property for a total purchase price of approximately 646,000. 
 
 In November 2008, the plant was substantially completed and plant operations commenced. The plant consists of the following buildings: 
 
 A grains area, fermentation area, distillation - evaporation area; 
 A dryer/energy center area; 
 A tank farm; 
 An auxiliary area; and 
 An administration building. 
 
 Our plant is in excellent condition and is capable of functioning at over 100 of its 100 million gallons per year nameplate production capacity. 
 
 In September 2017, we completed a construction project to add grain receiving and train loading facilities and additional rail spurs, track and grain storage to allow us to procure, transport and sell grain commodities.

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
 
 Patent Infringement 
 
 On June 27, 2008, we entered into a Tricanter Purchase and Installation Agreement with ICM, Inc. for the construction and installation of a Tricanter Oil Separation System. On February 12, 2010, GS CleanTech Corporation ("GS CleanTech") filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Indiana, claiming that Cardinal's operation of the oil recovery system manufactured and installed by ICM, Inc. infringes a patent claimed by GS CleanTech. GS CleanTech subsequently filed actions against others for infringement of its patent rights, adding several additional patents and successfully petitioned for the cases to be joined in a multi-district litigation. ICM, Inc. agreed to indemnify Cardinal and defend the lawsuit at no expense to Cardinal. On October 23, 2014, the United States District Court (the "Court") granted summary judgment finding that all of the patents claimed by GS CleanTech were invalid and that Cardinal had not infringed. In addition, on September 15, 2016, the Court granted summary judgment finding that the patents were invalid due to inequitable conduct before the US Patent and Trademark Office by the inventors and their attorneys. These rulings were subsequently affirmed on appeal and on February 22, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to review the decision. The Court has yet to rule on the final attorney fees to be awarded to the defendants.

 Market for Our Units 
 
 As of November 19, 2021, we had approximately 14,606 membership units outstanding and approximately 1,054 unit holders of record. There is no public trading market for our units. However, we have established through FNC Ag Stock, LLC a Unit Trading Bulletin Board, a private online matching service, in order to facilitate trading among our members. The Unit Trading Bulletin Board has been designed to comply with federal tax laws and IRS regulations establishing an alternative trading service, as well as state and federal securities laws. Our Unit Trading Bulletin Board consists of an electronic bulletin board that provides a list of interested buyers with a list of interested sellers, along with their non-firm price quotes. The Unit Trading Bulletin Board facilitates matches between potential sellers and buyers and assists the sellers and buyers with transfers. We do not become involved in any purchase or sale negotiations arising from our Unit Trading Bulletin Board and have no role in effecting the transactions beyond approval, as required under our operating agreement, and the issuance of new certificates. We do not give advice regarding the merits or shortcomings of any particular transaction. We do not receive, transfer or hold funds or securities as an incident of operating the Unit Trading Bulletin Board. We do not receive any compensation for creating or maintaining the Unit Trading Bulletin Board. In advertising our alternative trading service, we do not characterize Cardinal as being a broker or dealer or an exchange. We do not use the Unit Trading Bulletin Board to offer to buy or sell securities other than in compliance with the securities laws, including any applicable registration requirements. 
 
 There are detailed timelines that must be followed under the Unit Trading Bulletin Board Rules and Procedures with respect to offers and sales of membership units. All transactions must comply with the Unit Trading Bulletin Board Rules, our operating agreement, and are subject to approval by our board of directors. 
 
 As a limited liability company, we are required to restrict the transfers of our membership units in order to preserve our partnership tax status. Our membership units may not be traded on any established securities market or readily traded on a secondary market (or the substantial equivalent thereof). All transfers are subject to a determination that the transfer will not cause the Company to be deemed a publicly traded partnership.

 Revenues 
 
 We have two reportable segments-the Ethanol Division and the Trading Division. Our revenues from operations from our Ethanol Division come from three primary sources: sales of fuel ethanol, distillers grains and corn oil. Revenues from operations of our Trading Division are derived from procuring, transporting and selling grain commodities. Revenues in each division also include net gains or losses from derivatives related to products sold. 
 
 The following table shows the sources of our total revenue from the two segments and the approximate percentage of revenues to total revenues in our consolidated statements of operations for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2021 and 2020:

 Ethanol 
 
 Our revenues from ethanol increased for our fiscal year ended September 30, 2021, as compared to our fiscal year ended September 30, 2020. This increase in revenues is primarily the result of a higher average price per gallon of ethanol sold and an increase in gallons of ethanol sold for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021, as compared to the same period in 2020. Revenue also includes the net gains or losses from derivatives related to the commodities purchased. 
 
 Our average price per gallon of ethanol sold for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021, was 53.2 higher than our average price per gallon of ethanol sold for the same period in 2020. Ethanol market prices have been higher for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021 due to an increase in fuel demand, lower ethanol production due to some plants in certain areas curtailing production in response to poor market conditions, and higher oil and corn prices during the period. In addition, ethanol prices were negatively impacted in fiscal year ended September 30, 2020 by industry-wide production in excess of demand due to a variety of factors including the granting by the EPA of small refinery waivers, trade barriers resulting from 
 24 

Table of Contents 

disputes with foreign governments and a collapse in both domestic and foreign demand as a result of restrictions put in place in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. 
 
 Management anticipates that ethanol prices may decrease due to seasonal declines in domestic demand and potentially lower corn prices depending on the size of the 2021 crop. In addition, as certain ethanol plants returned to higher production levels as operating conditions improve, industry over-production could have a negative effect on prices and potentially result in negative operating margins. Declines in ethanol exports and continued trade disputes with foreign governments such as China would also likely contribute to lower ethanol prices. In addition, the U.S. Supreme Court's recent decision regarding small refinery waivers could result in the EPA granting additional waivers to oil refineries seeking relief from ethanol use requirements. If that were to occur, ethanol prices could be negatively affected. 
 
 We experienced an increase in ethanol gallons sold of 4.2 for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021, as compared to the same period in 2020 resulting primarily from increased ethanol production rates. We are currently operating at a rate of approximately 135 million gallons annually. In addition, we have installed an ethanol recovery system which we expect will be fully operational during the winter of 2021/2022 and which we anticipate will result in an increase in efficiencies allowing us to achieve higher ethanol production rates. However, management continues to monitor economic conditions carefully. If market conditions worsen affecting our ability to profitably operate the plant, we may be forced to reduce our ethanol production rate or even temporarily shut down ethanol production altogether. 
 
 Distillers Grains 
 
 Our revenues from distillers grains increased in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021, as compared to the same period in 2020. This increase in revenues is primarily the result of an increase in the average price per ton of distillers grains sold for the period ended September 30, 2021, as compared to the same period in 2020. 
 
 The average market price per ton of distillers grains sold for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021, increased by 34.0 compared to the average price per ton of distillers grains sold for the same period in 2020. This increase in the market price of distillers grains is primarily due to higher corn and soybean meal prices which resulted in end users seeking out distillers grains as the lower cost alternative during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021. 
 
 Management anticipates that distillers grains prices will continue to be affected by the price of corn and soybean meal. If there continues to be an oversupply of soybean meal, that could have a negative effect on the price of distillers grains. An increase in supply as certain ethanol plants return to higher production levels as operating conditions improve could also have a negative effect on distillers grains prices. In addition, if trade disputes with foreign countries such as China are not favorably resolved, this could have a negative effect on distillers grains prices unless additional demand can be sustained from domestic or other foreign markets. 
 
 We experienced an increase of 3.5 in distillers grains tons sold in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021, as compared to the same period in 2020 due increased DDGS production rates during the fiscal year. We are currently operating at an ethanol production rate of approximately 135 million gallons annually which is approximately 35 above the nameplate capacity for the plant. However, if we were to reduce ethanol production that would result in a corresponding decrease in distillers grains production. 
 
 Corn Oil 
 
 Our revenues from corn oil sales increased by 86.4 in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021, as compared to the same period in 2020 which was mainly the result of increased volume of sales and an increase in the average price per pound of corn oil sold for the period ended September 30, 2021, as compared to the same period in 2020. We experienced an increase of 13.5 in pounds of corn oil sold during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021, as compared to the same period in 2020 due to higher corn oil yield on average resulting in higher corn oil production for the period. 
 
 The average price per pound of corn oil sold for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021, increased by 68.0 as compared to the same period in 2020. Higher soybean oil prices along with increased biodiesel production had a positive effect on corn oil prices for the period, particularly towards the beginning of fiscal year 2021. Soybean oil is the primary competitor with distillers corn oil. 
 
 Management anticipates that corn oil prices will continue to follow soybean oil prices. Corn oil prices are also likely to be negatively affected by an increase in corn oil supply as operating conditions improve and certain ethanol plants increase

production levels. However, the extension of the biodiesel tax credit by Congress is likely to continue to have a positive impact on demand from biodiesel producers and corn oil prices. 
 
 We are currently operating at an ethanol production rate of approximately 135 million gallons annually which is approximately 35 above the nameplate capacity for the plant. However, if we are forced to again reduce ethanol production that would result in a corresponding decrease in corn oil production. 
 
 Trading Division 
 
 The following table shows the sources of our revenues from our Trading Division for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021 and 2020: 
 2021 2020 Revenue Source Amount of Revenues Amount of Revenues Soybean Sales 75,635,032 99.8 33,057,394 99.7 Other Revenue 121,200 0.2 87,450 0.3 Total Revenues 75,756,232 100.0 33,144,844 100.0 
 
 Soybeans 
 
 During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021, revenues from our Trading Division were derived primarily from transporting and selling soybeans. Our revenues from soybean sales increased for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021, as a result of an increase in bushels of soybeans sold of 61.3 during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021, as compared to the same period in 2020. The increase in bushels of soybeans sold is primarily due to more conducive market conditions for selling for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021. 
 
 We also experienced an increase of 41.3 in the average price per bushel of soybeans sold for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021, as compared to the same period in 2020 primarily due to smaller carryout for the 2020 harvest driving the remaining stock price higher. The presence of exports to China during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021 was also a contributing factor to higher prices. The average price per bushel of soybeans sold was 12.96 based on sales of approximately 5,834,000 bushels for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021. 
 
 Cost of Goods Sold 
 
 Ethanol Division 
 
 Our cost of goods sold for this division as a percentage of its total revenues was 90.1 for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021, as compared to 98.3 for the same period in 2020. This decrease in cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenues was the result of increased ethanol prices relative to the price of corn and natural gas for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021, as compared to the same period in 2020. Our two largest costs of production are corn and natural gas. Cost of goods sold also includes net gains or losses from derivatives related to commodities purchased. 
 
 Corn 
 
 Our largest cost associated with the production of ethanol, distillers grains and corn oil is corn cost. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021, the bushels of corn we used to produce our ethanol, distillers grains and corn oil increased by 4.6 as compared to the same period in 2020. More bushels were used in production due to higher overall ethanol production levels for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021, compared to the same period in 2020. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021, our average price paid per bushel of corn increased 45.1 as compared to the same period in 2020 due primarily due to smaller ending stocks from the 2020 harvest, concerns that the anticipated planting acres for 2021 would be insufficient to compensate for the smaller 2020 crop, and increased export demand from China. 
 
 Weather, world supply and demand, current and anticipated stocks, agricultural policy and other factors can contribute to volatility in corn prices. If corn prices rise, it will have a negative effect on our operating margins unless the price of ethanol and distillers grains out paces rising corn prices. Volatility in the price of corn could significantly impact our cost of goods sold.

Natural Gas 
 
 Our natural gas cost was higher during our fiscal year ended September 30, 2021, as compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020. This increase in the cost of natural gas for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021, as compared to the same period in 2020 was primarily the result of an increase of 13.5 in the average price per MMBTU of natural gas primarily due to increased demand. In addition, natural gas prices were higher towards the end of the period as a result of an increase in the price of crude oil. We also used 5.7 more MMBTUs of natural gas for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021, as compared to the same period in 2020 which was primarily due to higher ethanol production. 
 
 Management expects that natural gas prices will be dependent upon government policy and the severity of the coming winter weather. If the nation were to experience a catastrophic weather event causing problems related to the supply of natural gas, this could result in higher natural gas prices. 
 
 Rail Car Rehabilitation Costs 
 
 We lease 180 hopper rail cars under a multi-year agreement which ends in November 2023. Under the agreement, we are required to pay to rehabilitate each car for "damage" that is considered to be other than normal wear and tear upon turn in of each car at the termination of the lease. We have evaluated the condition of the cars and believe that it is probable that we may be assessed for damages incurred. Management has estimated total costs to rehabilitate the cars at September 30, 2021, to be approximately 1,751,000. During the year ended September 30, 2021, we have recorded an expense in cost of goods of 298,000. We accrue the estimated cost per railcar damages over the term of the lease. 
 
 Trading Division 
 
 The following table shows the costs incurred to procure various agricultural commodities for our Trading Division for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021 and 2020: 
 2021 2020 Amount of Revenues Amount of Revenues Soybeans 73,774,703 97.4 31,415,693 94.8 Total Cost of Goods Sold 73,774,703 97.4 31,415,693 94.8 
 
 Soybeans 
 
 During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021, our cost was primarily the procurement of soybeans for sale. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021, our average price paid per bushel of soybeans was 23.5 more as compared to the same period in 2020 due to concerns over a smaller crop and smaller ending stocks from the 2020 harvest. We also purchased 58.9 more bushels of soybeans during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021, as compared to the same period in 2020. 
 
 Derivatives 
 
 We enter into hedging instruments to minimize price fluctuations in the prices of our finished products and inputs. As the current market price of our hedge positions changes, the realized or unrealized gains and losses are immediately recognized in our revenues and our cost of goods sold. These commodity-based derivatives are not designated as effective hedges for accounting purposes. Please refer to "Item 7A - Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk-Commodity Price Risk" for information on our derivatives. 
 
 Operating Expense 
 
 Our operating expenses as a percentage of revenues were 1.8 for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021, as compared to operating expenses of 2.8 of revenues for the same period in 2020. Operating expenses include salaries and benefits of administrative employees, insurance, taxes, professional fees, depreciation of trading division fixed assets, property taxes and other general administrative costs. Our efforts to optimize efficiencies and maximize production may result in a decrease in our operating expenses on a per gallon basis. These expenses generally do not vary with the level of production at the plant; we expect our operating expenses to remain consistent with 2021 into and throughout our 2022 fiscal year.

Operating Income (Loss) 
 
 Our income from operations for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021, was 6.8 of our revenues compared to operating loss of 0.6 of revenues for the same period in 2020. The increase in operating income for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021, was primarily the result of a positive corn to ethanol spread. 
 
 Other Income (Expense) 
 
 We had other expense for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021 of 0.1 of revenues compared to other income of 0.1 of revenues for the same period in 2020. Other expense for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021 consisted of a loss on the disposal of a boiler and a loss from tainted soybeans. These losses were offset by the receipt of PPP loan forgiveness during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021. Other income for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020, consisted primarily of insurance proceeds from the DDGS silo explosion being received in January 2020

 Revenues 
 
 We have two reportable segments-the Ethanol Division and the Trading Division. Our revenues from operations from our Ethanol Division come from three primary sources: sales of fuel ethanol, distillers grains and corn oil. Revenues from operations of our Trading Division are derived from procuring, transporting and selling grain commodities. Revenues in each division also include net gains or losses from derivatives related to products sold. 
 
 The following table shows the sources of our total revenue from the two segments and the approximate percentage of revenues to total revenues in our unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2020 and 2019:

 Ethanol 
 
 Our revenues from ethanol decreased for our fiscal year ended September 30, 2020, as compared to our fiscal year ended September 30, 2019. This decrease in revenues is primarily the result of a lower average price per gallon of ethanol sold and a decrease in gallons of ethanol sold for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020, as compared to the same period in 2019. Revenue also includes the net gains or losses from derivatives related to the commodities purchase. 
 
 Our average price per gallon of ethanol sold for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020, was 4.9 lower than our average price per gallon of ethanol sold for the same period in 2019. Ethanol market prices have been lower as a result of an extended period of industry-wide production in excess of demand due to a variety of factors including the granting by the EPA of small refinery waivers and trade barriers resulting from disputes with foreign governments. This was exacerbated by a collapse in both domestic and foreign demand as a result of restrictions put in place in response to the COVID-19 pandemic which caused ethanol stocks in the United States to become significantly high and prices to decrease dramatically. As a result of poor economic conditions, many ethanol plants curtailed or stopped ethanol production. The decrease in industry-wide production coupled with a gradual increase in domestic demand due to the lifting of COVID-19 restrictions in many areas and the summer driving season in the United States had a positive effect on ethanol prices towards the end of the period. 
 
 Management anticipates that ethanol prices will be negatively effected as ethanol plants return to higher production levels due to improving operating conditions. Ethanol prices may also decrease if certain areas of the United States reinstate restrictions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic resulting in a decrease in fuel demand. Continued declines in ethanol exports due to decreased global fuel consumption in response to the COVID-19 pandemic or trade disputes with foreign governments would also likely contribute to lower ethanol prices and potentially negative operating margins. Finally, the granting of additional EPA waivers to small refiners could have a negative effect on ethanol prices. 
 
 We experienced a decrease in ethanol gallons sold of 2.7 for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020, as compared to the same period in 2019 resulting primarily from decreased ethanol production rates. In March 2020, we reduced our ethanol production rate by approximately 20 due to unfavorable operating conditions in the ethanol industry and the COVID-19 pandemic. However, beginning in May 2020, we began operating at an ethanol production rate of approximately 135 million gallons annually which is approximately 35 above the nameplate capacity for the plant. 
 
 Distillers Grains 
 
 Our revenues from distillers grains decreased in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020, as compared to the same period in 2019. This decrease in revenues is primarily the result of a decrease in tons of distillers grains sold for the period ended September 30, 2020, as compared to the same period in 2019. We experienced a decrease of 7.3 in distillers grains tons sold in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020, as compared to the same period in 2019 due to lower production. 
 
 The average market price per ton of distillers grains sold for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020, increased by 4.7 compared to the average price per ton of distillers grains sold for the same period in 2019. This increase in the market price of distillers grains is primarily due to a reduction in distillers grains supply due to some ethanol plants curtailing or shutting down ethanol production in response to poor economic conditions and lower corn stocks nearing the end of fiscal year ended September 30, 2020. 
 
 Corn Oil 
 
 Our revenues from corn oil sales increased by 17.7 in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020, as compared to the same period in 2019 which was mainly the result of increased volume of sales. We experienced an increase of 21.6 in pounds 
 29 

Table of Contents 

of corn oil sold during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020, as compared to the same period in 2019 due to higher corn oil yield on average resulting in higher corn oil production for the period. 
 
 The average price per pound of corn oil sold for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020, decreased by 3.8 as compared to the same period in 2019. Lower prices in the early part of our 2020 fiscal year due to a surplus of corn oil in the market were only partially offset by higher prices because of a decrease in corn oil supply later in the period due to some ethanol plants reducing or shutting down production in response to poor economic conditions. The higher prices toward the end of the fiscal year also resulted from higher prices for soybean oil. Soybean oil is the primary competitor with distillers corn oil. 
 
 Trading Division 
 
 The following table shows the sources of our revenues from our Trading Division for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020 and 2019:

 Soybeans 
 
 During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020, revenues from our Trading Division were derived primarily from transporting and selling soybeans. Our revenues from soybeans sales decreased for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020, as a result of a decrease in bushels of soybeans sold of 18.3 during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020, as compared to the same period in 2019. The decrease in bushels of soybeans sold is primarily due to smaller ending stocks, commonly referred to as carryout in the grain industry, in the local region for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020. 
 
 We also experienced an increase of 5.3 in the average price per bushel of soybeans sold for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020, as compared to the same period in 2019 primarily due to smaller carryout for the 2019 harvest driving the remaining stock price higher. The presence of exports to China during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020 was also a contributing factor to higher prices. The average price per bushel of soybeans sold was 9.17 based on sales of approximately 3,616,000 bushels for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020. 
 
 Cost of Goods Sold 
 
 Ethanol Division 
 
 Our cost of goods sold for this division as a percentage of its total revenues was 98.3 for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020, as compared to 100.4 for the same period in 2019. This decrease in cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenues was the result of decreased corn prices relative to the price of ethanol for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020, as compared to the same period in 2019. Our two largest costs of production are corn and natural gas. Cost of goods sold also includes net gains or losses from derivatives related to commodities purchased. 
 
 Corn 
 
 Our largest cost associated with the production of ethanol, distillers grains and corn oil is corn cost. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020, the bushels of corn we used to produce our ethanol, distillers grains and corn oil decreased by 2.2 as compared to the same period in 2019. Less bushels were used in production due to lower overall ethanol production levels for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020, compared to the same period in 2019. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020, our average price paid per bushel of corn decreased 3.0 as compared to the same period in 2019 due primarily to concerns related to the COVID-19 pandemic. 
 
 Natural Gas 
 
 Our natural gas cost was lower during our fiscal year ended September 30, 2020, as compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019. This decrease in the cost of natural gas for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020, as compared to the same period in 2019 was primarily the result of a decrease of 11.0 in the average price per MMBTU of natural gas primarily 
 30 

Table of Contents 

due to plentiful supply and low demand. In addition, natural gas prices were lower towards the end of the period as a result of a reduction in the price of crude oil. We also used 1.7 less natural gas for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020, as compared to the same period in 2019 which was primarily due to lower ethanol production. 
 
 Rail Car Rehabilitation Costs 
 
 We lease 180 hopper rail cars under a multi-year agreement which ends in November 2023. Under the agreement, we are required to pay to rehabilitate each car for "damage" that is considered to be other than normal wear and tear upon turn in of each car at the termination of the lease. We evaluated the condition of the cars and believe that it is probable that we may be assessed for damages incurred. Management estimated total costs to rehabilitate the cars at September 30, 2020, to be approximately 1,453,000. During the year ended September 30, 2020, we recorded an expense in cost of goods of 298,000. We accrue the estimated cost per railcar damages over the term of the lease.

 Soybeans 
 
 During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020, our cost was primarily the procurement of soybeans for sale. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020, our average price paid per bushel of soybeans was 4.1 more as compared to the same period in 2019 due to concerns over a smaller crop and smaller ending stocks from the 2019 harvest. We also purchased 2.9 less bushels of soybeans during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020, as compared to the same period in 2019. This is due primarily to a smaller 2019 crop to purchase coupled with a higher export demand.

 Operating Expense 
 
 Our operating expenses as a percentage of revenues were 2.8 for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020, as compared to operating expenses of 2.7 of revenues for the same period in 2019. Operating expenses include salaries and benefits of administrative employees, insurance, taxes, professional fees, depreciation of trading division fixed assets, property taxes and other general administrative costs. Our efforts to optimize efficiencies and maximize production may result in a decrease in our operating expenses on a per gallon basis. These expenses generally do not vary with the level of production at the plant; we expect our operating expenses to remain consistent with 2020 into and throughout our 2021 fiscal year. 
 
 Operating Loss 
 
 Our loss from operations for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020, was 0.6 of our revenues compared to operating loss of 2.7 of revenues for the same period in 2019. The decrease in operating loss for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020, was primarily the result of decreased corn prices relative to the cost of ethanol.

Other Income 
 
 We had other income of 0.1 of revenues for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Other income for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020, consisted primarily of insurance proceeds from the DDGS silo explosion being received in January 2020, partially offset by interest expense. 
 
 Changes in Financial Condition for the Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2021 
 
 The following table highlights the changes in our financial condition for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2021 and 2020: 
 September 30, 2021 September 30, 2020 Current Assets 76,439,260 45,522,739 Current Liabilities 23,741,046 16,442,809 Long-term Liabilities 3,460,301 4,347,119 Members' Equity 124,737,578 108,947,350 
 
 We experienced an increase in our current assets at September 30, 2021 as compared to September 30, 2020. This increase was primarily driven by an increase in our cash, restricted cash, accounts receivable and inventories at September 30, 2021 compared to September 30, 2020. The increase in cash and restricted cash was because of the varying cash requirements with derivative trading counter-parties. Accounts receivable increased due the timing of rail shipments of ethanol and soybeans. Inventory values also increased due to the market conditions and prices related to our inventory on hand at September 30, 2021, as compared with September 30, 2020. 
 
 We experienced an increase in our current liabilities at September 30, 2021, as compared to September 30, 2020. This increase is primarily due to the increase in our grain accounts payable at September 30, 2021, as compared to September 30, 2020, which resulted from the timing of harvest for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021, as compared to September 30, 2020. 
 
 We experienced a decrease in our long-term liabilities as of September 30, 2021, as compared to September 30, 2020 as a result of the amortization related to the long-term portion of the operating lease liability as of September 30, 2021 because of the implementation of ASC 842. Our Payroll Protection Program Loan was forgiven as of April 6, 2021 by the Small Business Administration, further reducing our long term liabilities. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 We, and the ethanol industry as a whole, experienced adverse conditions throughout most of 2019 and 2020, as a result of industry-wide record low ethanol prices due to reduced demand and high industry inventory levels. These factors, which are compounded by the recent impact of COVID-19, resulted in negative operating margins, lower cash flow from operations and net operating losses. In response to the low margin environment, we reduced our ethanol production rate by approximately 20 in March 2020. However, as margins improved in May 2020, we returned to full production and are currently operating at approximately 135 million gallons annually which is approximately 35 above the nameplate capacity for the plant. We continue to monitor COVID-19 developments and the effect on demand for our products in order to determine whether future adjustments to production are warranted. 
 
 The market price of corn and soybeans has recently increased significantly. As a result, we increased our limit on our Revolving Credit Loan by 5,000,000 in order to protect our risk management strategy. Based on financial forecasts performed by our management, we anticipate that with this increase in our credit, we will have sufficient cash from our credit facilities and cash from our operations to continue to operate the ethanol plant for the next 12 months. However, should operating conditions in the ethanol industry deteriorate or continue for a prolonged period, we could have difficulty maintaining our liquidity and may need to rely on our revolving lines of credit or seek to increase our limits for operations. Further, we are considering substantial capital improvements to our facility over the next two years. We intend to work with our lender to provide the capital resources for these improvements.

Comparison of Cash Flows for Fiscal Years Ended September 30, 2021 and 2020 
 
 The following table shows cash flows for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021 and 2020: 
 2021 2020 Net cash provided by operating activities 32,148,142 5,736,271 Net cash used for investing activities (3,846,527) (2,796,452) Net cash used for financing activities (11,319,650) (8,059,957) Net increase (decrease) in cash restricted cash 16,981,965 (5,120,138) Cash restricted cash, beginning of period 16,913,982 22,034,120 Cash restricted cash, end of period 33,895,947 16,913,982 
 
 Cash Flow from Operations 
 
 We experienced an increase in our cash flow from operations for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021, as compared to the same period in 2020. This increase was primarily due to improved margins on our primary products for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021, as compared to the same period in 2020 coupled with a greater deferral of payments for grain until January as of September 30, 2021 compared with September 30, 2020. This deferral is larger because of the increase in the price of corn and soybeans in 2021 compared with 2020. 
 
 Cash Flow used for Investing Activities 
 
 We used more cash in investing activities for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021, as compared to the same period in 2020. This increase was primarily the result of increased capital expenditures for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021, as compared with the same period in 2020. 
 
 Cash Flow used for Financing Activities 
 
 We used more cash for financing activities for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021, as compared to the same period in 2020. This increase was the result of using more cash in distributions to our members during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021, as compared with the same period in 2020. 
 
 Our liquidity, results of operations and financial performance will be impacted by many variables, including the market price for commodities such as, but not limited to, corn, ethanol, soybeans and other energy commodities, as well as the market price for any co-products generated by the facility and the cost of labor and other operating costs. Assuming future relative price levels for corn, ethanol, distillers grains and soybeans remain consistent with the relative price levels as of September 30, 2021, we expect operations to generate adequate cash flows to maintain operations. 
 Comparison of Cash Flows for Fiscal Years Ended September 30, 2020 and 2019 
 
 The following table shows cash flows for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020 and 2019: 
 2020 2019 Net cash provided by operating activities 5,736,271 7,951,807 Net cash used for investing activities (2,796,452) (1,677,363) Net cash used for financing activities (8,059,957) (3,478,316) Net increase (decrease) in cash restricted cash (5,120,138) 2,796,128 Cash restricted cash, beginning of period 22,034,120 19,237,992 Cash restricted cash, end of period 16,913,982 22,034,120 
 
 Cash Flow from Operations 
 
 We experienced a decrease in our cash flow from operations for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020, as compared to the same period in 2019. This decrease was primarily due to the amount of inventory on hand at the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020, as compared to the same period in 2019 coupled with changes in various working capital items, particularly a decrease in accounts receivable and an increase in accounts payable as of September 30, 2020.

Cash Flow used for Investing Activities 
 
 We used more cash in investing activities for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020, as compared to the same period in 2019. This increase was primarily the result of capital expenditures for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020, coupled with the receipt of funds in fiscal year ended September 30, 2019, from the acquisition account from Randolph County Redevelopment Commission of approximately 2,300,000. No funds were received from the acquisition account in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020. 
 
 Cash Flow used for Financing Activities 
 
 We used more cash for financing activities for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020, as compared to the same period in 2019. This increase was the result of paying off the Grain Loadout Facility Loan that was partially offset by receipt of the PPP Loan in fiscal year ended September 30, 2020. More cash was also used in distributions to our members during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020, as compared with the same period in 2019. 
 
 Our liquidity, results of operations and financial performance will be impacted by many variables, including the market price for commodities such as, but not limited to, corn, ethanol, soybeans and other energy commodities, as well as the market price for any co-products generated by the facility and the cost of labor and other operating costs. Assuming future relative price levels for corn, ethanol, distillers grains and soybeans remain consistent with the relative price levels as of September 30, 2020, we expect operations to generate adequate cash flows to maintain operations. 
 Short and Long Term Debt Sources 
 
 We have a loan agreement consisting of two loans, the Declining Revolving Loan ("Declining Loan") and the Revolving Credit Loan. In exchange for these loans, we granted liens on all property (real and personal, tangible and intangible) which include, among other things, a mortgage on the property, a security interest on commodity trading accounts, and assignment of material contracts. Please refer to "Item 8 - Financial Statements, Note 9 - Bank Financing" for additional details. Effective January 26, 2021, we amended the loan agreement in order to extend the termination dates of the Declining Loan and Revolving Credit Loan to April 30, 2021, and increase the limit under the Revolving Credit Loan to 20,000,000. 
 On April 30, 2021, we executed a Seventeenth Amendment of First Amended and Restated Construction Loan Agreement which amends the First Amended and Restated Construction Loan Agreement dated June 10, 2013 (the "Seventeenth Amendment") with FNBO. The primary purposes of the Seventeenth Amendment were to extend the termination dates of the Declining Loan to February 28, 2023 and the Revolving Credit Loan to February 28, 2022 and modify the applicable interest rates for both loans. The Seventeenth Amendment assigns an interest rate of the U.S. Prime Rate as published in The Wall Street Journal minus 15 basis points (.15 to the Declining Loan and the U.S. Prime Rate as published in The Wall Street Journal minus 25 basis points (.25 to the Revolving Credit Loan. The Seventeenth Amendment also establishes a minimum interest rate for the Declining Loan of 2.85 and for the Revolving Credit Loan of 2.75 . 
 Declining Loan 
 The maximum availability of the Declining Loan is 5,000,000 with such amount to be available for working capital purposes. The interest rate on the Declining Loan at September 30, 2021 was 3.10 . There were no borrowings outstanding on the Declining Loan at September 30, 2021 or September 30, 2020. The Declining Loan was due to mature on April 30, 2021 but has since been renewed until February 28, 2023 at essentially the same terms. 
 
 Revolving Credit Loan 
 
 The Revolving Credit Loan has a limit of 20,000,000 supported by a borrowing base made up of our corn, ethanol, dried distillers grain, corn oil and soybean inventories reduced by accounts payable associated with those inventories having a priority. It is also supported by the eligible accounts receivable and commodity trading account excess margin funds. The interest rate on the Revolving Credit Loan at September 30, 2021 was 3.00 . There were no borrowings outstanding on the Revolving Credit Loan at September 30, 2021 or September 30, 2020. The Revolving Credit Loan was due to mature on April 30, 2021 but has since been renewed until February 28, 2022 at essentially the same terms.

Table of Contents 

Covenants 
 
 During the term of the loans, we will be subject to certain financial covenants. Our minimum working capital is 15,000,000, which is calculated as our current assets plus the amount available for drawing under our long term revolving note, less current liabilities. Our minimum fixed charge coverage ratio is no less than 1.15:1.0 measured on a rolling four quarter average basis. However, for any reporting period, if our working capital is equal to or more than 23,000,000, we will be subject to maintaining a debt service charge coverage ratio of no less than 1.25:1.0 in lieu of the fixed charge coverage ratio. 
 
 Our loan agreement also requires us to obtain prior approval from our lender before making, or committing to make, capital expenditures exceeding an aggregate amount of 5,000,000. 
 
 We are meeting our liquidity needs and complying with our financial covenants and the other terms of our loan agreements at September 30, 2021. Based on current management projections, we anticipate that future operations will be sufficient to generate enough cash flow to maintain operations, service any new debt and comply with our financial covenants and other terms of our loan agreements through September 30, 2021. Should market conditions deteriorate in the future, circumstances may develop which could result in us violating the financial covenants or other terms of our loan agreements. Should we violate the terms or covenants of our loan or fail to obtain a waiver of any such term or covenant, our primary lender could deem us in default of our loans and require us to immediately repay a significant portion or possibly the entire outstanding balance of our loans if we have a balance outstanding. In that event, our lender could also elect to proceed with a foreclosure action on our plant. 
 Paycheck Protection Program Loan 
 
 In March 2020, Congress passed the Paycheck Protection Program, authorizing loans to small business for use in paying employees that continue to work throughout the COVID-19 pandemic and for rent, utilities and interest on mortgages. Loans obtained through the Paycheck Protection Program are eligible to be forgiven as long as the proceeds are used for qualifying purposes and other conditions are met. On April 20, 2020, we received a loan in the approximate amount of 856,000 through the Paycheck Protection Program. The entire loan was used for payroll, utilities and interest on our loans. In April 2021, we received and recognized the forgiveness of the Paycheck Protection Program Loan. 
 
 Capital Improvements 
 
 The board of directors approved various capital projects in order to make certain improvements to our ethanol plant to allow us to increase our annual ethanol production rate and maintain our facility. These improvements include updates to our heat exchangers, boilers, grain probe, and other small miscellaneous projects as well as the purchase of a new payloader for our dried distillers grains loadout system. We have also invested in an ethanol recovery system which is expected to cost approximately 2,400,000 and be funded with funds from operations and our existing debt facilities. We were nearing completion of the project during the fourth quarter subject to final testing which is anticipated to be finished during the late fall of 2021. 
 
 Development Agreement 
 
 In September 2007, we entered into a development agreement with Randolph County Redevelopment Commission the Commission to promote economic development in the area. Under the terms of this agreement, beginning in January 2008 through December 2028, the money we pay toward property tax expense is allocated to an expense and an acquisition account. The funds in the acquisition account can be used by the Commission to purchase equipment, at our direction, for the plant. We do not have title to or control over the funds in the acquisition account, no amounts have been recorded in the balance sheet relating to this account. During the fiscal years ended September 30, 2021 and September 30, 2020, no amounts were refunded to the Company and used to offset costs of capital expenditures.

Contractual Cash Obligations 
 
 In addition to our long-term debt obligations, we have certain other contractual cash obligations and commitments. The following tables provide information regarding our contractual obligations and approximate commitments as of September 30, 2021: 
 Payment Due By Period Contractual Cash Obligations Total Less than One Year One to Three Years Three to Five Years After Five Years Long-Term Debt Obligations Operating Lease Obligations 4,990,540 3,255,289 1,735,251 Purchase Obligations 58,830,401 52,388,795 6,250,956 190,650 Total Contractual Cash Obligations 63,820,941 55,644,084 7,986,207 190,650 
 
 The operating lease obligations in the table above include our hopper and tank railcars and forklift lease obligations as of September 30, 2021. Purchase obligations consist of forward contracted corn and soybean deliveries and forward contracted natural gas purchases. 
 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 
 Management uses various estimates and assumptions in preparing our financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and the reported revenues and expenses. Accounting estimates that are the most important to the presentation of our results of operations and financial condition, and which require the greatest use of judgment by management, are designated as our critical accounting estimates. We have the following critical accounting estimates: 
 
 We enter into derivative instruments to hedge the variability of expected future cash flows related to commodity markets. We do not typically enter into derivative instruments other than for economic hedging purposes. All derivative instruments are recognized on the September 30, 2021 balance sheet at their fair market value. Changes in the fair value of a derivative instrument that is designated as and meets all of the required criteria for a cash flow hedge are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income and reclassified into earnings as the underlying hedged items affect earnings. 
 
 As of September 30, 2021, we have open short (selling) positions for 21,181,740 bushels of corn and long (buying) positions for 13,710,000 bushels of corn on the Chicago Board of Trade, open short (selling) positions of 8,610,000 gallons of ethanol and long (buying) positions of 9,660,000 gallons of ethanol on the Chicago Board of Trade. We have open long (buying) positions for soybean oil of 4,020,000 pounds on the Chicago Board of Trade. We also have open short (selling) positions for 1,768,111 bushels of soybeans and no long (buying) positions of bushels of soybeans on the Chicago Board of Trade. These derivatives have not been designated as an effective hedge for accounting purposes. Corn, ethanol, soybean oil and soybean positions are forecasted to settle through December 2023, June 2022, December 2021 and November 2023, respectively. There may be offsetting positions that are not shown on a net basis that could lower the notional amount of positions outstanding as disclosed above. 
 
 We carry our long-lived assets at the original acquisition cost as required by current generally accepted accounting principles. Due to business conditions and the business environment in which our industry operates, the fair market value of those assets could, theoretically, fall below the amount which we carry them in our financial statements. In such cases, those assets would be known as impaired. Thus, we periodically perform an assessment of the fair value of these assets. Given the significant assumptions required and the possibility that actual conditions will differ, we consider the assessment of the useful lives of property and equipment to be a critical accounting estimate. Our assessment shows us that the fair value of our long-lived assets as a group is substantially in excess of its carrying value. 
 
 Inventories consist of raw materials, work in process, finished goods, grain inventory and parts. Corn is the primary raw material. Finished goods consist of ethanol, dried distiller grains and corn oil. We, other than for our Trading Division, state inventories at the lower of weighted average cost or net realizable value. For our Trading Division, we state our grain inventories at market price less estimated disposition costs. Net realizable value is the estimated selling prices in the normal course of business, less reasonably predictable costs. Our estimates are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. These valuations require the use of management's assumptions which do not

reflect unanticipated events and circumstances that may occur. In our analysis, we consider future corn costs and ethanol prices, break-even points for our plant and our risk management strategies in place through our derivative instruments and forward contracts. Given the significant assumptions required and the possibility that actual conditions will differ, we consider the valuation of the lower of cost or net realizable value on inventory to be a critical accounting estimate. 
 
 We enter into forward contracts for grain purchases and natural gas to supply the two divisions. These contracts represent firm purchase commitments which must be evaluated for potential losses. We have determined that there are no losses that are required to be recognized on these firm purchase commitments related to contracts in place at September 30, 2021. Our estimates include various assumptions including the future prices of ethanol, distillers grains, corn, natural gas and soybeans. 
 
 We lease 180 hopper rail cars under a multi-year agreement which ends in November 2023. Under the agreement, we are required to pay to rehabilitate each car for "damage" that is considered to be other than normal wear and tear upon return of each car at the termination of the lease. We have estimated total costs to rehabilitate the cars at September 30, 2021, to be approximately 1,750,680. This is based on our estimate of incurred damages as of the end of the fiscal year, on expected total car damages at the lease termination, and upon damage claims charged to industry peers with similar leasing arrangements. During the year ended September 30, 2021, we have recorded an expense in cost of goods sold of 298,000. We accrue the estimated cost of damage to the rail cars over the term of the lease, but because the actual cost is not finalized until the lease termination, it is reasonably possible that there will be a change in the estimate in the future. 

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 
 We are exposed to the impact of market fluctuations associated with interest rates and commodity prices as discussed below. We have no exposure to foreign currency risk as all of our business is conducted in U.S. Dollars. We use derivative financial instruments as part of an overall strategy to manage market risk. We use cash, futures and option contracts to hedge changes to the commodity prices of corn and natural gas. We do not enter into these derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes, nor do we designate these contracts as hedges for accounting purposes. 
 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 
 Our Declining Loan and Revolving Credit Loan all bear variable interest rates. However, there were no borrowings outstanding on the Declining Loan or the Revolving Credit Loan at September 30, 2021. 
 
 Commodity Price Risk 
 
 We expect to be exposed to market risk from changes in commodity prices. Exposure to commodity price risk results from our dependence on corn in the ethanol production process and the sale of ethanol. 
 
 We seek to minimize the risks from fluctuations in the prices of raw material inputs, such as corn and natural gas, and finished products, such as ethanol and distillers grains, through the use of hedging instruments. In practice, as markets move, we actively manage our risk and adjust hedging strategies as appropriate. Although we believe our hedge positions accomplish an economic hedge against our future purchases and sales, management has chosen not to use hedge accounting, which would match the gain or loss on our hedge positions to the specific commodity purchase being hedged. We are using fair value accounting for our hedge positions, which means as the current market price of our hedge positions changes, the realized or unrealized gains and losses are immediately recognized in our cost of goods sold or as an offset to revenues. The immediate recognition of hedging gains and losses can cause net income to be volatile from quarter to quarter due to the timing of the change in value of the derivative instruments relative to the cost and use of the commodity being hedged. 
 
 We enter into forward contracts for our commodity purchases and sales on a regular basis. It is our intent that, as we enter in to these contracts, we will use various hedging instruments to maintain a near even market position. For example, if we have 1 million bushels of corn under fixed price contracts we would generally expect to enter into a short hedge position to offset our price risk relative to those bushels we have under fixed price contracts. Because our ethanol marketing company is selling substantially all of the gallons it markets on a spot basis we also include the corn bushel equivalent of the ethanol we have produced that is inventory but not yet priced as bushels that need to be hedged. 
 
 At September 30, 2021, we had a net short position of 1,050,000 gallons of ethanol under derivative contracts used to hedge our future ethanol sales for various delivery periods through June 2022, a net short (selling) position of 7,471,740 bushels of corn under derivative contracts used to hedge our forward corn contracts, corn inventory and ethanol sales for various delivery periods through December 2023. At September 30, 2021, we had a net long (buying) position of 4,020,000 pounds of soybean oil under derivative contracts used to hedge our future corn oil sales for various periods through December 2021. At

Table of Contents 

September 30, 2021, we had a net short (selling) position of 1,768,111 bushels of soybeans under derivative contracts used to hedge its forward soybean purchase contracts for various periods through November 2023 that it had entered into for its new Trading Division. These derivatives have not been designated as an effective hedge for accounting purposes. There may be offsetting positions that are not shown on a net basis that could lower the notional amount of positions outstanding as disclosed above. At September 30, 2021, we also had entered into certain forward purchase contracts for soybeans at fixed prices for which we elected to account for as derivatives. The following table provides details regarding the gains and (losses) from our derivative instruments in the statements of operations, none of which are designated as hedging instruments for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2021, 2020 and 2019: 
 
 Fiscal Year Ended Fiscal Year Ended Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2021 September 30, 2020 September 30, 2019 Corn Derivative Contracts (18,881,451) 2,196,868 (2,035,159) Ethanol Derivative Contracts 1,392,605 (5,484,019) 467,160 Natural Gas Derivative Contracts (836) 23,354 Soybean Oil Derivative Contracts 1,813,519 Soybean Derivative Contracts (6,518,841) (279,131) 628,652 Soybean Forward Purchase and Sales Contracts Derivatives (894,717) 970,344 1,509,539 Totals (23,089,721) (2,595,938) 593,546 
 
 At September 30, 2021, we had forward corn purchase contracts at various fixed prices for various delivery periods through November 2023 for 6.7 of our expected production needs for the next 26 months. At September 30, 2021, we also had forward dried distiller grains sales contracts at various fixed prices for various delivery periods through November 2021 for 44.4 of expected production for the next 2 months and forward corn oil contracts at various prices for various delivery periods through December 2021 for 48.9 of expected production for the next 3 months. Also, at September 30, 2021, we had forward natural gas contracts for 40.4 of expected purchases for the next 25 months at various prices for various delivery periods through October 2023. We had no forward ethanol sales contracts at fixed prices as of September 30, 2021. 
 
 We began operating our Trading Division in late September 2017. In preparation for beginning those operations, we entered into forward purchases contracts for soybeans. At September 30, 2021, the Company had soybean forward purchase and sales contracts at various fixed prices for various delivery periods through October 2023 for 16.0 of its anticipated trading volume of that commodity for the next 25 months. 
 
 As contracts are delivered, any gains or losses realized will be recognized in our gross margin. Due to the volatility and risk involved in the commodities market, we cannot be certain that these gains or losses will be realized. 
 
 As corn prices move in reaction to market trends and information, our income statement will be affected depending on the impact such market movements have on the value of our derivative instruments. Depending on market movements, crop prospects and weather, these price protection positions may cause immediate adverse effects, but are expected to produce long-term positive growth for us. 
 
 A sensitivity analysis has been prepared to estimate our exposure to ethanol, distillers grains, corn oil, corn, natural gas and soybeans price risk. Market risk related to these factors is estimated as the potential change in income resulting from a hypothetical 10 adverse change in the average cost of our corn and natural gas and average ethanol, distillers grains, corn oil and soybeans prices as of September 30, 2021 net of the forward and future contracts used to hedge our market risk. The volumes are based on our expected use, purchase and sale of these commodities for a one year period from September 30, 2021. The results of this analysis, which may differ from actual results, are approximately as follows:

 Liability Risk 
 
 We participate in a captive reinsurance company (the Captive ). The Captive reinsures losses related to worker's compensation, commercial property and general liability. Premiums are accrued by a charge to income for the period to which the premium relates and is remitted by our insurer to the captive reinsurer. The Captive reinsures catastrophic losses in excess of a predetermined amount. Our premiums are structured such that we have made a prepaid collateral deposit estimated for losses related to the above coverage. The Captive insurer has estimated and collected an amount in excess of the estimated losses but less than the catastrophic loss limit insured by the Captive. We cannot be assessed in excess of the amount in the collateral fund.

 The Company's operating and financial performance is largely driven by prices at which the Company sells ethanol, distillers grains and corn oil, and the related cost of corn. The price of ethanol is influenced by factors such as supply and demand, weather, government policies and programs, and the unleaded gasoline markets and the petroleum markets, although, since 2005, the prices of ethanol and gasoline began a divergence with ethanol selling for less than gasoline at the wholesale level. Excess ethanol supply in the market, in particular, puts downward pressure on the price of ethanol. The Company's largest cost of production is corn. The cost of corn is generally impacted by factors such as supply and demand, weather, government policies and programs. The Company's risk management program is used to protect against the price volatility of these commodities.

 Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 Our management is responsible for maintaining disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that the Company files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and forms. In addition, the disclosure controls and procedures must ensure that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required financial and other required disclosures. 
 
 Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer (the principal executive officer), Jeffrey L. Painter, along with our Chief Financial Officer (the principal financial officer), William Dartt, have reviewed and evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of September 30, 2021. Based on this review and evaluation, these officers have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods required by the forms and rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission; and to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management including our principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 
 Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
 Inherent Limitations Over Internal Controls 
 
 Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: 
 
 (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; 
 
 (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and 
 
 (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 
 Management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our internal controls will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of internal controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. Also, any evaluation of the effectiveness of

controls in future periods are subject to the risk that those internal controls may become inadequate because of changes in business conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
 
 Management's Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
 Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended). Management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria set forth in the 2013 Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO ). Based on this evaluation, management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of September 30, 2021. 
 
 This annual report does not include an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. As we are a non-accelerated filer, management's report is not subject to attestation by our registered public accounting firm pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 that permit us to provide only management's report in this annual report.
