We continue to develop our products and services offerings through the expertise of our research and development resources. We believe our acquisition, investment, and integration approach has allowed us to accelerate our internal development and significantly accelerate our time to market. For further information on our acquisitions, please refer to Note 4, Acquisitions to our Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Form 10-K. Life Sciences Market Our life sciences businesses serve a broad range of end markets within the life sciences industry to address a confluence of life sciences trends, such as technology, information management and new sophisticated tools and applications. With the advent of biologics and personalized medicine, biological samples have become critical assets to the success of drug and therapy pipelines, and the proper management and protection of these samples has gained increased importance to our customers. We believe this trend has created a sizable market opportunity for Brooks to provide comprehensive sample management and genomic solutions. Since the successful mapping of the full human genome at the turn of this century, the market for genomic services has grown in support of research in biologic drug development, personalized medicine and cell/gene therapy. Top pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies can use their in-house laboratory resources to sequence the millions of genes needed as part of their research workflow. Still, many companies look to outsource their gene sequencing to independent laboratories that provide expedited results and expert consultative services. Other companies and institutions have fewer or no in-house options and make use of outsourced capabilities as their primary solution. We participate in this market as a value-added laboratory services provider, offering high quality genetic testing services with fast turnaround time. We have more than 8,700 customers globally and we address only a fraction of the industry. We serve top customers in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry, the most advanced research hospitals performing clinical research and therapy development, as well as some of the newest and leading-edge start-ups in the biotech space. We also serve academic and government institutions. We believe that the sample-based services and products business will continue to demonstrate a growth trajectory and we do not observe cyclical characteristics in demand for these offerings. ` Segments Our business is comprised of two reportable segments, our Life Sciences Products segment and our Life Sciences Services segment.

We cannot guarantee that these efforts will meaningfully protect our trade secrets. As of September 30, 2021, we owned approximately 60 issued U.S. patents, with various corresponding patents issued in foreign jurisdictions. We also had approximately 30 pending U.S. patent applications, with foreign counterparts of some of these applications having been filed or which may be filed at the appropriate time. Our patents will expire at various dates through 2038. 

Environmental Matters We are subject to federal, state, local environmental laws and regulations, and the environmental laws and regulations of the foreign national and local jurisdictions in which we have manufacturing facilities. We believe we are in compliance in all material respects with such laws and regulations. Compliance with foreign, federal, state, and local laws and regulations has not had, and is not expected to have, an adverse effect on our capital expenditures, competitive position, financial condition or results of operations. Human Capital As of September 30, 2021, we employed approximately 2,800 people which includes full-time and part-time employees, in addition, we utilized the services of 80 contingent associates, primarily in the United States.

 Available Information We file annual, quarterly and current reports, proxy statements and other information with the SEC. Our SEC filings are available to the public over the internet at the SEC s website at http://www.sec.gov. We also maintain a website at www.brooks.com, through which you can access our SEC filings. The information found on our website is not part of this or any other report we file with or furnish to the SEC. Item 1A. Risk Factors Factors That May Affect Future Results You should carefully consider the risks described below and the other information in this Form 10-K before deciding to invest in shares of our common stock. These are the risks and uncertainties applicable to our businesses, including our semiconductor automation business, that we believe are most important for you to consider. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us, which we currently deem immaterial or which are similar to those faced by other companies in our industry or business in general, may also impair our business operations. If any of the following risks or uncertainties actually occur, our business, financial condition and operating results would likely suffer. In that event, the market price of our common stock could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment. Risks Relating to the COVID-19 Pandemic Our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected by the COVID-1 pandemic. In December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus, causing a disease referred to as COVID-19, was first identified in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, resulting in shutdowns of manufacturing and commerce in the months that followed. Since then, COVID-19 has spread worldwide, including in the United States, and has resulted in authorities implementing numerous measures to try to contain the disease, such as travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter-in-place orders and shutdowns. We have followed the guidelines from the U.S. Center for Disease Control, or CDC, and implemented the recommended safety protocols, and the spread of COVID-19 has also caused us to modify our business practices (including curtailing employee travel, implementing vaccination and testing policies and extending work-from-home policies where necessary), and we may take further actions as required by government authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, customers, partners and suppliers. There is no certainty that such measures will be sufficient to mitigate the risks posed by the disease, and our ability to perform critical functions could be harmed. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the measures designed to contain its spread, our suppliers may not have the materials, capacity, or capability to supply our components according to our schedule and specifications. Further, there may be logistics issues, including our ability and our supply chain s ability to maintain production, as well as transportation demands that may cause further delays. If our suppliers operations are curtailed, we may need to seek alternate sources of supply, which may be more expensive. Alternate sources may not be available or may result in delays in shipments to us from our suppliers and subsequently to our customers. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic and the measures designed to stop the spread of the virus may have similar effects on our customers. The current pandemic may also give rise to force majeure contractual protections being asserted by customers and/or suppliers that we maintain contracts with, potentially relieving contractual obligations these parties have to us. In any case, any disruption of our suppliers or customers businesses would likely negatively impact our sales and operating results. While the disruptions and restrictions on the ability to travel, quarantines and other measures taken as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic are expected to be temporary, the duration of any of these measures, and related financial impact, cannot be estimated at this time. Should these measures continue for an extended period of time or be re-implemented after, the impact on our supply chain and customers could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows. Further, while the potential impact and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global economy and our business in particular may be difficult to assess or predict, the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in, and may continue to result in, significant disruption of global financial markets and an economic downturn that may affect demand for our

 products and services, reduce our ability to access capital or our customers ability to pay us for past or future purchases, impact our operating results, and have a negative impact on our liquidity and stock price. In addition, an extended recession or an additional financial market correction resulting from the spread of COVID-19 could, adversely affect demand for our products and services, our business and the value of our common stock. The global pandemic of COVID-19 continues to rapidly evolve, and we will continue to monitor the COVID-19 situation closely. Although the magnitude of the impact of the pandemic on our business and operations remains uncertain, the continued spread of COVID-19 and actions taken to mitigate such spread as well as the prolonged nature of the pandemic or the occurrence of other outbreaks of contagious diseases could adversely impact our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.

 Risks Relating to the Sale of our Semiconductor Automation Business The announcement and pendency of the sale of our semiconductor automation business to Thomas H. Lee Partners, L.P. could have an adverse effect on our stock price and/or our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. The announcement and pendency of the sale of our semiconductor automation business to Thomas H. Lee Partners, L.P., or THL, pursuant to the equity interest purchase agreement we entered into on September 20, 2021 could disrupt our business in the following ways, among others: customers may determine to delay or defer purchase decisions with regard to our semiconductor products and services or terminate and/or attempt to renegotiate their relationships with us as a result of the pending sale, whether pursuant to the terms of their existing agreements with us or otherwise; investors and customers may perceive that the loss of annual revenue generated by our semiconductor automation business, which was 680.1 million in fiscal year 2021, will negatively impact our growth potential and future financial results; and the attention of our management may be directed toward the completion of the pending sale and related matters, and their focus may be diverted from the day-to-day business operations of our company, including from other opportunities that might otherwise be beneficial to us. Should any of these matters occur, they could adversely affect our stock price or harm our business, results of operations, financial condition, and prospects. Obtaining required approvals necessary to satisfy the conditions to the completion of the sale of our semiconductor automation business may delay or prevent completion of the pending sale. The completion of the sale of our semiconductor automation business to THL is conditioned upon obtaining certain regulatory approvals. We intend to pursue all required approvals in accordance with the terms of the equity interest purchase agreement. No assurance, however, can be given that the required approvals will be obtained and, even if all such approvals are obtained, no assurance can be given as to the terms, conditions and timing of the approvals or that the approvals will satisfy the terms of the equity interest purchase agreement. Inability to complete the sale of our semiconductor automation business could negatively impact our business, financial condition, results of operations or our stock price. The completion of the sale of our semiconductor automation business to THL is subject to a number of conditions, including, among others, receipt of certain regulatory approvals, and there not having been a material adverse effect with respect to such business, and there can be no assurance that the conditions to the completion of the pending sale will be satisfied. The equity interest purchase agreement may also be terminated by us and/or THL in certain specified circumstances, including in certain circumstances if the sale has not been consummated by June 30, 2022. While the potential sale is pending and if the pending sale is not completed, we will be subject to several risks, including: the current trading price of our common stock may reflect a market assumption that the sale will be completed; we have incurred and expect to continue to incur substantial transaction costs in connection with the pending sale whether or not it is completed; under the equity interest purchase agreement, we are subject to certain restrictions on the conduct of our business prior to the completion of the pending sale, which restrictions could adversely affect our ability to realize certain of our business strategies or take advantage of certain business opportunities; the negative perception of investors and customers of our semiconductor automation business if the sale is not consummated and our inability to operate the business in the same manner as before the announcement of the proposed sale the failure to receive the purchase price from the sale and our inability to use these funds as expected to expand our life sciences businesses; and

Table of Contents 
 the risks inherent and specific to the semiconductor automation business, including the historical cyclicality in demand for semiconductor capital equipment, the critical importance of supply chain stability, and potential international trade restrictions and other geopolitical risks. Any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and stock price. Risks Relating to Our Operations Our operating results could fluctuate significantly, which could negatively impact our business. Our revenue, operating margins and other operating results could fluctuate significantly from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year depending upon a variety of factors, including: changes in the timing and terms of product orders and service contracts by our customers as a result of our customer concentration or otherwise; changes in the demand for the mix of products and services that we offer; timing and market acceptance of our new product and services introductions; delays or problems in the planned introduction of new products or services, or in the performance of any such products following delivery to customers or the quality of such services; new products, services or technological innovations by our competitors, which can, among other things, render our products and services less competitive due to the rapid technological changes in the markets in which we provide products and services; the timing and related costs of any acquisitions, divestitures or other strategic transactions; our ability to reduce our costs in response to decreased demand for our products and services; our ability to accurately estimate customer demand, including the accuracy of demand forecasts used by us; disruptions in our manufacturing process or in the supply of components to us; write-offs for excess or obsolete inventory; competitive pricing pressures; and increased amount of investment into the infrastructure to support our growth, including capital equipment, research and development, as well as selling and marketing initiatives to support continuous product and services innovation, technological capability enhancements and sales efforts. The timing of revenue generation coupled with the increased amount of investment may result in operating losses. 
 As a result of these risks, we believe that reference to past performance for comparisons of our revenue and operating results may not be meaningful, and that these comparisons may not be an accurate indicator of our future performance. If we do not continue to introduce new products and services that reflect advances in technology in a timely and effective manner, our products and services may become obsolete and our operating results will suffer. Our success is dependent on our ability to respond to the technological changes present in the markets we serve. The success of our product development and introduction of products and services to market depends on our ability to: identify and define new market opportunities, products and services in an accurate manner; 
 12 

Table of Contents 
 obtain market acceptance of our products and services; innovate, develop, acquire and commercialize new technologies and applications in a timely manner; adjust to changing market conditions; differentiate our offerings from our competitors offerings; obtain and maintain intellectual property rights where necessary; continue to develop a comprehensive, integrated product and service strategy; price our products and services appropriately; and design our products to high standards of manufacturability so that they meet customer requirements. 
 If we cannot succeed in responding in a timely manner to technological and/or market changes or if the new products and services that we introduce do not achieve market acceptance, our competitive position would diminish which could materially harm our business and our prospects. The global nature of our business exposes us to multiple risks. During fiscal years ended September 30, 2021, 2020 and 2019, approximately 38 , 34 and 32 of our revenue was derived from sales outside of North America. We expect that international sales, including increased sales in Asia, will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenue for the foreseeable future, and that in particular, the proportion of our sales to customers in China will continue to increase, due in large part to our significant genomic services operation in China. Additionally, we intend to invest additional resources in facilities in China, which will increase our global footprint of sales, service and repair operations. As a result of our international operations, we are exposed to many risks and uncertainties, including: longer sales-cycles and time to collection; tariff and international trade barriers; fewer or less certain legal protections for intellectual property and contract rights abroad; different and changing legal and regulatory requirements in the jurisdictions in which we operate; government currency control and restrictions on repatriation of earnings; a diverse workforce with different experience levels, languages, cultures, customs, business practices and worker expectations, and differing employment practices and labor issues; fluctuations in foreign currency exchange and interest rates, particularly in Asia and Europe; and political and economic instability, changes, hostilities and other disruptions in regions where we operate. 
 Negative developments in any of these areas in one or more countries could result in a reduction in demand for our products, the cancellation or delay of orders already placed, threats to our intellectual property, difficulty in collecting receivables, and a higher cost of doing business, any of which could materially harm our business and profitability.

 Our business could be materially harmed if we fail to adequately integrate the operations of the businesses that we have acquired or may acquire. We have made in the past, and may make in the future, acquisitions or significant investments in businesses with complementary products, services and/or technologies. Our acquisitions, present numerous risks, including: difficulties in integrating the operations, technologies, products and personnel of the acquired companies and realizing the anticipated synergies of the combined businesses; defining and executing a comprehensive product strategy; managing the risks of entering markets or types of businesses in which we have limited or no direct experience; the potential loss of key employees, customers and strategic partners of ours or of acquired companies; unanticipated problems or latent liabilities, such as problems with the quality of the installed base of the target company s products or infringement of another company s intellectual property by a target company s activities or products; problems associated with compliance with the acquired company s existing contracts; difficulties in managing geographically dispersed operations; and the diversion of management s attention from normal daily operations of the business. 
 If we acquire a new business, we may expend significant funds, incur additional debt or issue additional securities, which may negatively affect our operations and be dilutive to our stockholders. In periods following an acquisition, we will be required to evaluate goodwill and acquisition-related intangible assets for impairment. If such assets are found to be impaired, they will be written down to estimated fair value, with a charge against earnings. The failure to adequately address these risks or the impairment of any assets could materially harm our business and financial results. The possibility of these risks impacting our business will likely expand after the expected completion of the sale our semiconductor automation businesses. Expanding within current markets introduces new competitors and commercial risks. A key part of our growth strategy is to continue expanding within the life sciences sample management and genomic services markets. As part of this strategy, we expect to diversify our product sales and service revenue by leveraging our core technologies, which requires investments and resources which may not be available on favorable terms or at all when needed. We cannot guarantee that we will be successful in leveraging our capabilities into the life sciences sample management and genomic services markets to meet all the needs of new customers and to compete favorably. Because a significant portion of our growth potential may be dependent on our ability to increase sales within each of the Life Sciences Product and Life Sciences Services segments, our inability to successfully expand within the markets serviced by these segments may adversely impact future financial results. Changes in key personnel could impair our ability to execute our business strategy. The continuing service of our executive officers and essential engineering, scientific and management personnel, together with our ability to attract and retain such personnel, is an important factor in our continuing ability to execute our strategy. There is substantial competition to attract such employees and the loss of any such key employees could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results. The same could be true if we were to experience a high turnover rate among engineering and scientific personnel and we were unable to replace them.

 Global climate change and related legal and regulatory developments could negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Climate change presents immediate and long-term risks to us and to our customers, with the risks expected to increase over time. Our products and services are subject to and affected by environmental regulation by federal, state, and local authorities in the United States and regulatory authorities with jurisdiction over our international operations. Future regulations or voluntary actions on our part in response to climate change could result in costly changes to our facilities to reduce carbon emissions and could increase energy costs as a result of switching to less carbon-intensive, but more expensive, sources of energy to operate our facilities and to transport and ship products and samples. There can be no assurance that climate change or environmental regulation and response will not have a negative competitive impact on our ability to provide sample management, automated storage, and genomic services or that economic returns will match the investment that we are making in the development of new products and services. We will likely face increasing complexity related to product design, the use of regulated materials, energy consumption and efficiency, and the reuse, recycling, or disposal of products and their components at end-of-use or useful life. There continues to be a lack of consistent climate legislation, which creates economic and regulatory uncertainty regarding future incentives for energy-efficiency and costs of compliance, which may impact the demand for our products and services, and our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, the potential physical impacts of climate change on our operations are highly uncertain and would be particular to the geographic circumstances in areas in which we operate. These may include changes in global weather patterns, which could include local changes in rainfall and storm patterns and intensities, water shortages, changing sea levels, and changing temperature averages or extremes. These impacts may also adversely affect our properties, our business, financial condition and results of operations. Unexpected events could disrupt our sample storage operations and adversely affect our reputation and results of operations. Unexpected events, including fires or explosions at our facilities, natural disasters, such as tornadoes, hurricanes and earthquakes, war or terrorist activities, unplanned power outages, supply disruptions and failure of equipment or systems, could adversely affect our reputation and results of operations. Our Life Sciences Services customers rely on us to securely store and timely retrieve and transport their critical samples, and these events could result in service disruptions, physical damage to one or more key storage facilities and the customer samples stored in those facilities, the temporary closure of one or more key operating facilities or the temporary disruption of service, each of which could negatively impact our reputation and results of operations. Our primary storage facility is located in Indianapolis, Indiana, an area of the United States that can be prone to tornadoes and other severe weather events. If our facilities were to experience a significant disruption in operations, our business could be materially harmed, while the failure to estimate customer demand accurately could result in excess or obsolete inventory. We have a limited number of manufacturing facilities for our products and laboratories for our service offerings. If the operations at any one of these facilities were disrupted as a result of a natural disaster, fire, power or other utility outage, work stoppage or other similar event, our business could be seriously harmed because we may be unable to manufacture and ship products and parts, or provide services, to our customers in a timely fashion. The impact of any disruption at one of our facilities may be exacerbated if the disruption occurs at a time when we need to rapidly increase our capabilities to meet increased demand or expedited shipment schedules. Moreover, if actual demand for our products or services is different than expected, we may purchase more/fewer component parts or other supplies than necessary or incur costs for canceling, postponing or expediting delivery of such parts or supplies. If we purchase inventory in anticipation of customer demand that does not materialize, or if our customers reduce or delay orders, we may incur excess inventory charges. Any or all of these factors could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

 Our business relies on certain critical information systems and a failure or breach of such a system could harm our business and results of operations and, in the event of unauthorized access to a customer s data or our data, incur significant legal and financial exposure and liabilities. We maintain and rely upon certain critical information systems for the effective operation of our business. These information systems include telecommunications, the internet, our corporate intranet, various computer hardware and software applications, network communications and e-mail. These information systems may be owned and maintained by us, our outsource providers or third parties such as vendors and contractors. These information systems are subject to attacks, failures, and access denials from a number of potential sources including viruses, destructive or inadequate code, power failures, and physical damage to computers, hard drives, communication lines and networking equipment. To the extent that these information systems are under our control, we have implemented security procedures, such as virus protection software and emergency recovery processes, to mitigate the outlined risks. However, security procedures for information systems cannot be guaranteed to be failsafe and our inability to use or access these information systems at critical points in time, or unauthorized releases of confidential information, could unfavorably impact the timely and efficient operation of our business. Confidential information stored on these information systems could also be compromised. If a third party gains unauthorized access to our data, including any information regarding our customers, such security breach could expose us to a risk of loss of this information, loss of business, litigation and possible liability. These security measures may be breached as a result of third-party action, including intentional misconduct by computer hackers, employee error, malfeasance or otherwise. Additionally, third parties may fraudulently attempt to induce employees or customers into disclosing sensitive information such as user names, passwords or other information in order to gain access to our customers data or our data, including our intellectual property and other confidential business information, or our information technology systems. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, or to sabotage systems, change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. Any security breach could result in a loss of confidence by our customers, damage our reputation, disrupt our business, lead to legal liability and negatively impact our future sales. Our goodwill and intangible assets may become impaired. As of September 30, 2021, we had 469.4 million of goodwill and 453.2 million in net intangible assets as a result of our acquisitions. We periodically review our goodwill and the estimated useful lives of our identifiable intangible assets, taking into consideration any events or circumstances that might result in either a diminished fair value, or for intangible assets, a revised useful life. These events and circumstances include significant changes in the business climate, legal factors, operating performance indicators, advances in technology and competition. Any impairment or revised useful life could have a material and adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations and could harm the trading price of our common stock. Changes in tax rates or tax regulation could affect results of operations. As a global company, we are subject to taxation in the United States and various other countries. Significant judgment is required to determine and estimate worldwide tax liabilities. Our future annual and quarterly effective tax rates could be affected by numerous factors, including changes in the following: applicable tax laws; composition of pre-tax income in countries with differing tax rates; and/or establishment of a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets based on the assessment of their realizability prior to expiration. Changes in applicable tax laws could significantly impact the estimates of our tax assets and liabilities, as well as expectations of future effective tax rates. Recently proposed U.S. corporate income tax reform could drive negative impacts to our tax position depending upon final enacted legislation. Based on the nature of the uncertainties around specific legislation to be agreed-upon by congress, we have not quantified the impact of this risk. In addition, we are subject to regular examination by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and state, local and foreign tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of favorable or unfavorable outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, there can be no assurance that any final determination will not be materially different from the treatment reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals, which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.

 International trade disputes could result in additional or increased tariffs, export controls or other trade restrictions that may have a material impact on our business. We sell a significant number of products outside the United States, including in China, Taiwan, Japan and South Korea. Based on the complex relationships among these countries and the United States, there is inherent risk that political, diplomatic and national security influences might lead to trade disputes, impacts and/or disruptions, in particular, with respect to those affecting the semiconductor industry. The United States and other countries have imposed and may continue to impose trade restrictions and have also levied tariffs and taxes on certain goods. Increases in tariffs, additional taxes or other trade restrictions and retaliatory measures may increasingly impact customer demand and customer investment in manufacturing equipment, increase our manufacturing costs, decrease margins, reduce the competitiveness of our products, or inhibit our ability to sell products or purchase necessary equipment and supplies, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. We are subject to numerous governmental regulations. We are subject to federal, state, local and foreign regulations, including environmental regulations, regulations relating to the design and operation of our products and control systems and regulations relating to certain of our service offerings. We might incur significant costs as we seek to ensure that our products meet safety and emissions standards, many of which vary across the states and countries in which our products are used. In the past, we have invested significant resources to redesign our products to comply with these directives. Compliance with future regulations, directives, and standards could require us to modify or redesign some products, change our service offerings, make capital expenditures, or incur substantial costs. If we do not comply with current or future regulations, directives, and standards: we could be subject to fines; our production or shipments could be suspended; and we could be prohibited from offering particular products or services in specified markets. 
 Any of these events could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Regulations and customer demands related to conflict minerals may adversely affect us. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act imposes disclosure requirements regarding the use in components of our products of conflict minerals mined from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries, whether the components of our products are manufactured by us or third parties. This requirement could affect the pricing, sourcing and availability of minerals used in the manufacture of components we use in our products. In addition, there are additional costs associated with complying with the disclosure requirements and customer requests, such as costs related to our due diligence to determine the source of any conflict minerals used in our products. We may face difficulties in satisfying customers who may require that all of the components of our products are certified as conflict mineral free and/or free of numerous other hazardous materials. Unfavorable currency exchange rate fluctuations may lead to lower operating margins, or may cause us to raise prices, which could result in reduced sales. Currency exchange rate fluctuations could have an adverse effect on our sales, cost of sales and results of operations, and we could experience losses with respect to forward exchange contracts into which we may enter. Unfavorable currency fluctuations could require us to increase prices to customers, which could result in lower net sales by us to such customers. Alternatively, if we do not adjust the prices for our products and services in response to unfavorable currency fluctuations, our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, most sales made by our foreign subsidiaries are denominated in the currency of the country in which these products are sold or these services are provided and the currency they receive in payment for such sales could be less valuable as compared to the U.S. dollar at the time of receipt as a result of exchange rate fluctuations. From time to time, we enter into forward exchange contracts to reduce currency exposure. However, we cannot be certain that our efforts will be adequate to 
 17 

Table of Contents 
 protect us against significant currency fluctuations or that such efforts will not expose us to additional exchange rate risks, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations. Our indebtedness may adversely affect our ability to operate our business, generate cash flows and make payments on such indebtedness On October 4, 2017, we entered into a 200.0 million Senior Secured Term Loan Facility, or term loan, with Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc., JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and Wells Fargo Securities, LLC pursuant to the terms of a credit agreement with the lenders. At September 30, 2021, the outstanding term loan principal balance was 49.7 million, excluding unamortized deferred financing costs of 0.3 million. The term loan matures and becomes fully payable on October 4, 2024. We are required to redeem the term loan at the principal amount then outstanding upon occurrence of certain events, as described in the credit agreement. For further information on this transaction, please refer to Note 11, Debt to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Form 10-K. Our ability to pay interest and repay the principal for our indebtedness, including the term loan, is dependent upon our ability to manage our business operations and maintain sufficient liquidity to service such debt. The loan borrowings are subject to variable interest rates which create exposure to interest rate risk. Interest rate increases may result in higher cost of servicing our loans and reduce our profitability and cash flows. The terms of our debt covenants in the credit agreement for the term loan could limit our ability to raise additional funds and the manner in which we conduct our business. We have the ability to refinance the term loan and obtain additional indebtedness as long as we maintain a certain level of liquidity and earnings, as specified in the credit agreement for the term loan. If our liquidity and earnings are reduced below a certain level, we will have limited ability to service the term loan and obtain additional debt financing. Our failure to comply with the restrictive covenants under the term loan and our other indebtedness could also result in an event of default under the term loan which, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of all or a portion of our indebtedness, including under the term loan. Accordingly, a default under the term loan would have a material adverse effect on our business and our lender would have the right to exercise its rights and remedies to collect, which would include the right to foreclose on our assets. Our failure to protect our intellectual property could adversely affect our future operations. Our ability to compete is significantly affected by our ability to protect our intellectual property. We rely upon patents, trade secret laws, confidentiality procedures, copyrights, trademarks and licensing agreements to protect our technology. Existing trade secret, trademark and copyright laws offer only limited protection. Our success depends in part on our ability to obtain and enforce patent protection for our products both in the United States and in other countries. We own numerous U.S. and foreign patents, and we intend to file additional applications, as appropriate, for patents covering our products and technology. Any issued patents owned by or licensed to us may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, and the rights under these patents may not provide us with competitive advantages. In addition, the laws of some countries in which our products are or may be developed, manufactured, or sold may not fully protect our products. Due to the rapid technological change that characterizes the life sciences and related process equipment industries, we believe that the improvement of existing technology, reliance upon trade secrets, unpatented proprietary know-how and the development of new products may be as important as patent protection in establishing and maintaining a competitive advantage. To protect trade secrets and know-how, it is our policy to require all technical and management personnel to enter into nondisclosure agreements. We cannot guarantee that the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property will be adequate to prevent the misappropriation of our technology. Other companies could independently develop similar or superior technology without violating our intellectual property rights. In the future, it may be necessary to engage in litigation or like activities to enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of proprietary rights of others, including our customers. This could require us to incur significant expenses and to divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel from our business operations. 
 18 

Table of Contents 
 The expiration of our patents over time could lead to an increase of competition and a decline in our revenue. One of our main competitive strengths is our technology, and we are dependent on our patent rights and other intellectual property rights to maintain our competitive position. Our current patents will expire from time to time through 2038 which could result in increased competition and declines in product and service revenue. We may be subject to claims of infringement of third-party intellectual property rights, or demands that we license third-party technology, which could result in significant expense and prevent us from using our technology. There has been substantial litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the industries in which we do business. We have in the past been, and may in the future be, notified that we may be infringing intellectual property rights possessed by third parties. We cannot guarantee that infringement claims by third parties or other claims for indemnification by customers or end-users of our products and services resulting from infringement claims will not be asserted in the future or that such assertions, whether or not proven to be true, will not materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We cannot predict the extent to which we might be required to seek licenses or alter our products or services so that they no longer infringe the rights of others. We also cannot guarantee that licenses will be available or the terms of any licenses we may be required to obtain will be reasonable. Similarly, changing our products, services or processes to avoid infringing the rights of others may be costly or impractical and could detract from the value of our products and services. If a judgment of infringement were obtained against us, we could be required to pay substantial damages and a court could issue an order preventing us from selling one or more of our products or offering certain of our services. Further, the cost and diversion of management attention brought about by such litigation could be substantial, even if we were to prevail. Any of these events could result in significant expense to us and may materially harm our business and our prospects. Risks Related to Reliance on Third Parties Our business could be materially harmed if one or more key suppliers fail to continuously deliver key components of acceptable cost and quality. We currently obtain many of our key components on an as-needed, purchase order basis from numerous suppliers. In some cases, we have only a single source of supply for key components and materials used in the manufacturing of our products. Further, a portion of our supply is sourced from Asia, including China and we do not always have a previous history of dealing with these suppliers. Our inability to obtain components or materials in required quantities or of acceptable cost and quality and with the necessary continuity of supply could result in delays or reductions in product shipments to our customers. In addition, if a supplier or sub-supplier suffers a production stoppage or delay for any reason, including natural disasters such as the tsunamis that affected Japan in 2011 and Thailand in 2004, this could result in a delay or reduction in our product shipments to our customers. Any of these contingencies could cause us to lose customers, result in delayed or lost revenue and otherwise materially harm our business. Our business could be adversely affected by a decline in the availability of raw materials. We are dependent on the availability of certain key raw materials and natural resources used in our products and various manufacturing processes, and we rely on third parties to supply us with these materials in a cost-effective and timely manner. Our access to raw materials may be adversely affected if our suppliers operations were disrupted as a result of limited or delayed access to key raw materials and natural resources which may result in increased cost of these items. Our outsource providers may fail to perform as we expect. Outsource providers have played and will continue to play a key role in many of our transactional and administrative functions, such as information technology and facilities management. Many of these outsourced service providers, including certain hosted software applications that we use for confidential data storage, employ cloud computing technology for such storage. These providers cloud computing systems may be susceptible to cyber incidents, such as intentional cyber-attacks aimed at theft of sensitive data or inadvertent cyber-security compromises, 
 19 

Table of Contents 
 which are outside of our control. Although we attempt to select reputable providers and secure their performance on terms documented in written contracts, it is possible that one or more of these providers could fail to perform or adequately protect our data from cyber-related security breaches as we expect and any such failure could have an adverse impact on our business. Risks Relating to Our Customers Because we rely on a limited number of customers for a large portion of our revenue, the loss of one or more of these customers could materially harm our business. We receive a significant portion of our revenue in each fiscal period from a relatively limited number of customers, and that trend is likely to continue. Sales to our ten largest customers accounted for approximately 19 , 19 and 21 , respectively, of our total revenue in the fiscal years ended September 30, 2021, 2020 and 2019. The loss of one or more of these major customers, a significant decrease in orders from one of these customers, or the inability of one or more customers to make payments to us when they are due could materially affect our revenue, business and reputation. Because of the lengthy sales cycles of many of our products, we may incur significant expenses before we generate any revenue related to those products. Our customers may need several months to test and evaluate our products. This increases the possibility that a customer may decide to cancel an order or change its plans, which could reduce or eliminate our sales to that customer. The impact of this risk can be magnified during the periods in which we introduce a number of new products and services, as has been the case in recent years. As a result of this lengthy sales cycle, we may incur significant research and development expenses, and selling, general and administrative expenses before we generate the related revenue for these products, and we may never generate the anticipated revenue if our customer cancels an order or changes its plans. Customers generally do not make long term commitments to purchase our products and our customers may cease purchasing our products at any time. Sales of our products are often made pursuant to individual purchase orders and not under long-term commitments and contracts. Our customers frequently do not provide any assurance of minimum or future sales and are not prohibited from purchasing products from our competitors at any time. Accordingly, we are exposed to competitive pricing pressures on each order. Our customers also engage in the practice of purchasing products from more than one manufacturer to avoid dependence on sole-source suppliers for certain of their needs. The existence of these practices makes it more difficult for us to increase price, gain new customers and win repeat business from existing customers. We may face claims for liability related to damages of customer materials attributed to the failure of our products or services, exposing us to significant financial or reputational harm. Our automated cold storage systems for the life sciences sample management market are used in the handling, movement and storage of biological and chemical samples. We also provide sample storage services to customers where we store their biological and chemical samples or perform genomics services at our facilities. In any case, inaccurate or faulty testing services or damage to our customers materials attributed to a failure of our products or services could lead to claims for damages made by our customers and could also harm our relationship with our customers and damage our reputation, resulting in material harm to our business. Risks Relating to Owning Our Securities Our stock price is volatile. The market price of our common stock has fluctuated widely. From the beginning of fiscal year 2020 through the end of fiscal year 2021, our stock price fluctuated between a high of 109.17 per share and a low of 46.70 per share. Consequently, the current market price of our common stock may not be indicative of future market prices, and we may 
 20

 be unable to sustain or increase the value of an investment in our common stock. Factors affecting our stock price may include: variations in operating results from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year; changes in earnings estimates by analysts or our failure to meet analysts expectations; changes in the market price per share of our public company customers; market conditions in the semiconductor, life sciences sample management and genomic services and other industries into which we sell products and services; global economic conditions; political changes, hostilities, the COVID-19 pandemic or similar events, or natural disasters such as hurricanes and floods; low trading volume of our common stock; the change in stockholders expected upon the completion of the sale of our semiconductor automation business; and the number of firms making a market in our common stock. 
 In addition, the stock market has in the past experienced significant price and volume fluctuations. These fluctuations have particularly affected the market prices of the securities of high technology companies like ours. These market fluctuations could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Provisions in our charter documents and Delaware law may delay or prevent an acquisition of us, which could decrease the value of your shares. Our restated certificate of incorporation and by-laws and Delaware law contain provisions that could make it harder for a third party to acquire us without the consent of our Board of Directors. These provisions include limitations on actions by our stockholders by written consent, the inability of stockholders to call special meetings and the potential for super majority votes of our stockholders in certain circumstances. In addition, as discussed below, our Board of Directors has the right to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval, which could be used to dilute the stock ownership of a potential hostile acquirer. Our restated certificate of incorporation makes us subject to the anti-takeover provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. In general, Section 203 prohibits publicly held Delaware corporations to which it applies from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder, unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner. This provision could discourage others from bidding for our shares of common stock and could, as a result, reduce the likelihood of an increase in the price of our common stock that would otherwise occur if a bidder sought to buy our common stock. Although we believe these provisions provide for an opportunity to receive a higher bid by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our Board of Directors, these provisions apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by stockholders. If a change of control or change in management is delayed or prevented, the market price of our common stock could decline. Our restated certificate of incorporation authorizes the issuance of shares of blank check preferred stock. Our restated certificate of incorporation provides that our Board of Directors is authorized to issue from time to time, without further stockholder approval, up to 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock in one or more series and to fix and designate the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions of the preferred stock, including dividend rights, conversion

 rights, voting rights, redemption rights and terms of redemption and liquidation preferences. Such shares of preferred stock could have preferences over our common stock with respect to dividends and liquidation rights. Our issuance of preferred stock may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control. Our issuance of preferred stock could decrease the amount of earnings and assets available for distribution to the holders of common stock or could adversely affect the rights and powers, including voting rights, of the holders of common stock. The issuance of preferred stock could have the effect of decreasing the market price of our common stock. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments None. Item 2.

Item 3. Legal Proceedings We are subject to various legal proceedings, both asserted and unasserted, that arise in the ordinary course of business. We cannot predict the ultimate outcome of such legal proceedings or in certain instances provide reasonable ranges of potential losses. However, as of the date of this report, we believe that none of these claims will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations. In the event of unexpected subsequent developments and given the inherent unpredictability of these legal proceedings, there can be no assurance that our assessment of any claim will reflect the ultimate outcome and an adverse outcome in certain matters could, from time-to-time, have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations in particular quarterly or annual periods.

Sale of the Semiconductor Automation Business In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell our semiconductor automation business, which consists of our Brooks Semiconductor Solutions Group reportable segment, to Thomas H. Lee, Partners, L.P., or THL, for 3.0 billion in cash subject to customary adjustments. Since our founding in 1978, we have been a leading automation provider and partner to the global semiconductor manufacturing industry. At the completion of the sale of the semiconductor automation business, we will no longer serve this market. We anticipate closing of the transaction in the first half of calendar year 2022 upon satisfaction of customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals. The semiconductor automation business has been classified as discontinued operations and, unless otherwise noted, this MD A relates solely to our continuing operations and does not include the operations of our semiconductor automation business. Sale of the Semiconductor Cryogenics Business In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell our semiconductor cryogenics business to Edwards Vacuum LLC (a member of the Atlas Copco Group) for approximately 675.0 million in cash, subject to customary adjustments. We originally acquired the cryogenics business in 2005 as part of the acquisition of Helix Technology Corporation. The semiconductor cryogenics business has been classified as discontinued operations and, unless otherwise noted, this MD A relates solely to our continuing operations and does not include the operations of our semiconductor cryogenics business. On July 1, 2019, we completed the sale of the semiconductor cryogenics business for 659.8 million. Net proceeds from the sale were 551.7 million, net of taxes and closing costs paid and remaining taxes payable. During the first quarter of fiscal year 2021, the final net working capital was determined, resulting in a negative adjustment in the amount of 1.8 million payable to Edwards. As part of this sale, we transferred our intellectual property, for our cryogenics pump products, but not our intellectual property related to our semiconductor automation or life sciences businesses. On July 1, 2019, in connection with the completion of the sale of our semiconductor cryogenics business, we used 495.3 million of the cash proceeds to extinguish debt. As a result of the debt extinguishment we recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of 5.2 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019. Refer to Liquidity and Capital Resources for further discussion of the debt extinguishment. Segments Our business is comprised of two reportable segments, our Life Sciences Products segment and our Life Sciences Services segment.

Business and Financial Performance Results of Operations Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2021 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2020 We reported revenue of 513.7 million for fiscal year 2021 compared to 388.5 million for fiscal year 2020, an increase of 125.2 million, or 32 . Gross margin was 47.5 for fiscal year 2021 compared to 44.3 for fiscal year 2020, an increase in gross profit of 71.7 million. Operating expenses were 274.9 million for fiscal year 2021 compared to 208.7 million for fiscal year 2020, an increase of 66.2 million. We reported an operating loss of 31.1 million for fiscal year 2021 compared to an operating loss of 36.6 million for fiscal year 2020, a decrease in operating loss of 5.5 million, which was primarily attributable to the revenue growth and gross margin improvement, partially offset by higher operating expenses. Other expenses, net includes 16 million of expense due to the release of a tax indemnification asset which is offset within our income tax benefit from the release of a related liability. Overall, we generated a net loss from continuing operations of 28.9 million during fiscal year 2021 as compared to 26.4 million in fiscal year 2020. Please refer to the Results of Operations section below for a detailed discussion of our financial results for the fiscal year 2021 compared to fiscal year 2020.

Please refer to the Liquidity and Capital Resources section below for a detailed discussion of our liquidity and changes in cash flows for fiscal year 2021 compared to fiscal year 2020. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES The preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue, intangible assets, goodwill, inventories, income taxes, and stock-based compensation. We base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. We evaluate current and anticipated worldwide economic conditions, both in general and specifically in relation to the life science industry, that serve as a basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily determinable based on information from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions that could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations. We believe that the assumptions and estimates associated with the following critical accounting policies involve significant judgment and thus have the most significant potential impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. Revenue Recognition We generate revenue from the sale of products and services. A description of our revenue recognition policies is included in the Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Form 10-K. Although most of our sales agreements contain standard terms and conditions, certain agreements contain multiple performance obligations or non-standard terms and conditions. For customer contracts that contain more than one performance obligation, we allocate the total transaction consideration to each performance obligation based on the relative stand-alone selling price of each performance obligation within the contract. We rely on either observable standalone sales or an expected cost-plus margin approach to determine the standalone selling price of offerings, depending on the nature of the performance obligation. Performance obligations whose standalone selling price is estimated using an expected cost-plus margin approach relate to the sale of customized automated cold sample management systems and service-type warranties within the Life Sciences Products segment. Revenue from the sales of certain products that involve significant customization, which primarily include automated cold sample management systems is recognized over time as the asset created by our performance does not have alternative use to us and an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date is present. We recognize revenue as work progresses based on a percentage of actual labor hours incurred on the project to-date and total estimated labor hours expected to be incurred on the project. The selection of the method to measure progress towards completion requires judgment. We have concluded that using the percentage of labor hours incurred to estimated labor hours needed to complete the project most appropriately depicts our efforts towards satisfaction of the performance obligation. We develop profit estimates for long-term contracts based on total revenue expected to be generated from the project and total costs anticipated to be incurred in the project. These estimates are based on a number of factors, including the degree of required product customization and the work required to be able to install the product in the customer s existing environment, as well as our historical experience, project plans and an assessment of the risks and uncertainties inherent in the contract related to implementation delays or performance issues that may or may not be within our control. We estimate a loss on a contract by comparing total estimated contract revenue to the total estimated contract costs and recognize a loss during the period in which it becomes probable and can be reasonably

 estimated. We review profit estimates for long-term contracts during each reporting period and revise the estimate based on changes in circumstances. If our judgment regarding revenue recognition proves incorrect, our revenue in particular periods may be adversely affected and could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations. Business Combinations We account for business acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting, in accordance with which assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at their respective fair values at the acquisition date. The fair value of the consideration paid, including contingent consideration, is assigned to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their respective fair values. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Significant judgment is used in determining fair values of assets acquired, liabilities assumed and contingent consideration, as well as intangibles and their estimated useful lives. Fair value and useful life determinations may be based on, among other factors, estimates of future expected cash flows, royalty cost savings and appropriate discount rates used in computing present values. For all the current year acquisitions, management applied significant judgment in estimating the fair value of the acquired intangible assets, which involved significant estimates and assumptions with respect to forecast revenue growth rates and the discount rates. These judgments may materially impact the estimates used in allocating acquisition date fair values to assets acquired and liabilities assumed, as well as our current and future operating results. Actual results may vary from these estimates that may result in adjustments to goodwill and acquisition date fair values of assets and liabilities during a measurement period or upon a final determination of asset and liability fair values, whichever occurs first. Adjustments to fair values of assets and liabilities made after the end of the measurement period are recorded within our operating results. During the third quarter of fiscal 2021, the Company recorded 9.4 million level 3 liability which represents contingent consideration for an acquisition within the Life Sciences Products segment. The amount is contingent based on the acquired business performance for the twelve-month period ending December 31, 2021. Please refer to Note 4, Acquisitions for further detail. Changes in the fair value of contingent consideration resulting from a change in the underlying inputs are recognized in results of operations until the arrangement is settled. Intangible Assets, Goodwill and Other Long-Lived Assets We have identified intangible assets and generated significant goodwill as a result of our acquisitions. Intangible assets other than goodwill are valued based on estimated future cash flows and amortized over their estimated useful lives. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually or more often if impairment indicators are present, at the reporting unit level. Intangible assets other than goodwill and long-lived assets are subject to impairment testing if events and circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or a group of assets may not be recoverable. The goodwill impairment test is performed at the reporting unit level. A reporting unit is either an operating segment or one level below it, which is referred to as a component. The level at which the impairment test is performed requires an assessment of whether the operations below an operating segment constitute a self-sustaining business, in which case testing is generally performed at this level. We have two operating and two reportable segments consisting of Life Sciences Products and Life Sciences Services. As of the date of our goodwill impairment test, we had six reporting units which three reporting units are within semiconductor automation discontinued operations. The three reporting units within the continuing operations include one reporting unit within Life Sciences Products operating segment and two reporting units within the Life Sciences Services operating segment. As a result of a change in our management reporting structure and immediately post to the annual goodwill impairment test, the Company combined two components within the Life Sciences Services operating segment, Sample Repository Solutions and Genomic Services components, into the Life Sciences Services reporting unit. The Company evaluated the aggregation criteria under ASC 350 for the two components and concluded that they exhibit similar economic characteristics and meet the aggregation criteria.

Table of Contents 
 We perform our annual goodwill impairment assessment on April 1 st of each fiscal year. We evaluate a reporting unit s goodwill for impairment between annual tests if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of such reporting unit below its carrying value. In accordance with ASC 350, Intangibles- Goodwill and Other , we initially assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. If we determine, based on this assessment, that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, we perform a quantitative goodwill impairment test by comparing the reporting unit s fair value with its carrying value. An impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the reporting unit s carrying value exceeds its fair value, up to the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. No impairment loss is recognized if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value. We also concluded that the fair value of the aggregated reporting units significantly exceeded the book value thus no adjustment to goodwill was necessary. We determine fair values of our reporting units based on an income approach in accordance with the discounted cash flow method, or DCF Method. The DCF Method is based on projected future cash flows and terminal value estimates discounted to their present values. Terminal value represents a present value an investor would pay on the valuation date for the rights to the cash flows of the business for the years subsequent to the discrete cash flow projection period. We consider the DCF Method to be the most appropriate valuation technique since it is based on management s long-term financial projections. In addition to determining the fair value of our reporting units based on the DCF method, we also compare the aggregate values of our net corporate assets and reporting unit fair values to our overall market capitalization and use certain market-based valuation techniques to assess the reasonableness of the reporting unit fair values determined in accordance with the DCF Method. The key inputs used in the DCF Method include revenue growth rates, gross margin percentage, selling, general and administrative expense percentage and discount rates that are at or above our weighted-average cost of capital. We derive discount rates that are commensurate with the risks and uncertainties inherent in the respective reporting units and our internally developed projections of future cash flows. Application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment based on market and operational conditions at the time of the evaluation, including management s best estimates of the reporting unit s future business activity and the related estimates and assumptions of future cash flows from the assets that include the associated goodwill. Different assumptions of revenue growth rates, gross margin percentage, selling, general and administrative expense percentage and the discount rate used in the DCF model could result in different estimates of the reporting unit s fair value as of each testing date. We completed our annual goodwill impairment test as of April 1, 2021 for the three reporting units within our continuing operations, including Life Sciences Products as the only reporting unit within our Life Sciences Products segment, and Sample Repository Solutions and Genomic Services within our Life Sciences Services segment. Based on the test results, we determined that no adjustment to goodwill was necessary. We conducted a qualitative assessment for the Life Science Products reporting unit and determined that it was more likely than not that its fair value was greater than its carrying value. As a result of the analysis, we did not perform the quantitative assessment for this reporting unit, and therefore, did not recognize any impairment losses. We performed the quantitative goodwill impairment test for the two reporting units within the Life Sciences Services segment. We determined that no adjustment to goodwill was necessary for these two reporting units. Both reporting units fair values significantly exceeded their respective book values. We are required to test long-lived assets, other than goodwill, for impairment when impairment indicators are present. For purposes of this test, long-lived assets are grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. If we determine that indicators of potential impairment are present, we assess the recoverability of the long-lived asset group by comparing its undiscounted future cash flows to its carrying value. If the carrying value of the long-lived asset group exceeds its future cash flows, we determine fair values of the individual net assets within the long-lived asset group to assess potential impairment. If the aggregate fair values of the individual net assets of the group are less than their carrying values, an impairment loss is recognized for an amount in excess of the group s aggregate carrying value over its fair value. The loss is allocated to the assets within the group based on their relative carrying values, with no asset reduced below its fair value.

 During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021, we announced that the life sciences businesses will be rebranded under a single, unified life sciences brand, Azenta Life Sciences, or Azenta, during the first half of fiscal year 2022. We concluded that the abandoned tradenames for these businesses were fully impaired in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2021 and recorded a 13.4 million charge for the tradename impairment loss. The impairment loss is included in the Selling, general and administrative expense in our Consolidated Statements of Operations . We did not test our long-lived assets for impairment during fiscal years 2020 since no events indicating impairment occurred during the periods then ended. Inventory We state our inventory at the lower of cost or market amount and make adjustments to reduce the inventory cost to its net realizable value by providing estimated reserves for excess or obsolete inventory. The reserves are established for the difference between the cost of inventory and its estimated market value based on assumptions related to future demand and market conditions to reduce the carrying value to its net realizable value. We fully reserve for inventories and non-cancelable purchase orders for inventory deemed obsolete. We perform periodic reviews of our inventory to identify excess inventories on hand. We compare on-hand inventory balances to anticipated inventory usage based on our recent historical activity and anticipated or forecasted demand for our products developed through our planning systems and sales and marketing inputs. We adjust the reserves for excess or obsolete inventory and record additional inventory write downs based on unfavorable changes in estimated customer demand or actual market conditions that may differ from management projections. Deferred Income Taxes We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. We consider recent historical income, estimated future taxable income, carry-forward periods of tax attributes, and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance. We evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets by tax-paying component and assess the need for a valuation allowance on an annual and quarterly basis. We evaluate the profitability of each tax-paying component on a historic cumulative basis and on a forward-looking basis while performing this analysis. After evaluating all the relevant positive and negative evidence we reduced our valuation allowance against certain foreign net deferred tax assets resulting in a tax benefit of 2.0 million in fiscal year 2021. We continue to hold a U.S. valuation allowance related to the realizability of certain state tax credits and net operating loss carry-forwards. We also maintain valuation allowances against net deferred tax assets in certain foreign tax-paying components as of the end of fiscal year 2021. Stock-Based Compensation We measure compensation cost for all employee stock awards at fair value on the date of grant and recognize compensation expense over the service period for awards expected to vest. The fair value of restricted stock units is determined based on the number of shares granted and the closing price of our common stock quoted on the Nasdaq Global Select Market on the date of grant, and the fair value of stock options is determined using the Black-Scholes valuation model. Such fair values are recognized as expense over the service period, net of estimated forfeitures. The estimation of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires significant judgment. We consider many factors when estimating expected forfeitures, including types of awards, employee class, and historical experience. In addition, for stock-based awards where vesting is dependent upon achieving certain operating performance goals, we estimate the likelihood of achieving the performance goals. Actual results, and future changes in estimates, may differ from our current estimates.

 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2021 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2020 Revenue We reported revenue of 513.7 million for fiscal year 2021 compared to 388.5 million for fiscal year 2020, an increase of 125.2 million, or 32 . The COVID-19 pandemic has had varying impacts on our business for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021. Further discussion of the impacts by each segment are discussed below. Our Life Sciences Products segment reported revenue of 199.6 million for fiscal year 2021 compared to 129.8 million for fiscal year 2020, an increase of 69.8 million or 54 . The increase in revenue was driven by all major product lines. Consumables and instruments were the most significant driver of the increase, primarily due to COVID-19 related demand. Our Life Sciences Services segment reported revenue of 314.1 million for fiscal year 2021 compared to 258.8 million for fiscal year 2020, an increase of 55.3 million or 21 . We reported an increase of 56.2 million from our genomics services business driven by Next Generation sequencing, gene synthesis services and Sanger sequencing. We reported a decrease in sample repository solutions revenue of 1.0 million primarily due to reduction of outsourced genomic services which were provided through an alliance with Infinity BiologiX LLC, formerly RUCDR, that was terminated in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020. Offsetting the decrease in revenue from the alliance was an increase in storage, informatics, and revenue from the acquisition of Trans-Hit Bio. Revenue increased 30 excluding the impact of the RUCDR alliance. We estimate that the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our revenue for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021 was a net increase of approximately 53 million in the aggregate primarily attributable to the increased demand for in our consumables and instruments products. We anticipate continued growth in revenue from our life sciences products and services businesses through our internally developed products and services and through our acquired businesses and potential future acquisitions. Revenue generated outside the United States amounted to 192.9 million, or 38 of total revenue, for fiscal year 2021 compared to 135.0 million, or 35 of total revenue, for fiscal year 2020. Operating Income (Loss) We reported an operating loss of 31.1 million for fiscal year 2021 compared to an operating loss of 36.6 million for fiscal year 2020. The decrease in operating loss of 15 was driven by higher revenue and gross profit, partially offset by an increase in both research and development expenses and selling, general and administrative expenses compared to the prior fiscal year. Within operating expenses, selling, general, and administrative expenses increased 61.8 million, and research and development expenses increased 4.6 million. Restructuring expenses decreased 0.3 million. Selling, general and administrative expenses for fiscal year 2021 included 13.4 million of impairment charges related to abandoned tradenames due to the rebranding of our life sciences business announced during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021. Cost of sales in fiscal year 2021 also included 5.5 million of cost of sales accrued for tariff liabilities related to intercompany import activity that occurred during the fiscal years of 2016 through 2020. The costs resulted from an internal review of the transaction value used to calculate tariffs on intercompany imports of samples shipped from our genomics services business. Operating income for our Life Sciences Products segment was 22.0 million for fiscal year 2021 compared to an operating loss of 4.2 million for fiscal year 2020. Cost of sales for our Life Sciences Products segment includes charges for amortization related to completed technology of 1.1 million for fiscal year 2021 and 1.2 million for the fiscal year 2020. Adjusted operating income for our Life Sciences Products segment, which excludes the charges mentioned above, was 23.1 million for fiscal year 2021 and adjusted operating loss in fiscal year 2020 was 3.0 million after excluding these charges.

Excluding the impact of the amortization related to completed technology, tariff charges and restructuring related charges, as described above, margins expanded 4.3 percentage points in fiscal year 2021, as compared to fiscal year 2020. Research and Development Expenses Research and development expenses were 22.4 million in fiscal year 2021 compared to 17.8 million in fiscal year 2020, which represented 4.4 and 4.6 of revenue for fiscal years 2021 and 2020, respectively. Research and development expenses in our Life Sciences Products segment were 10.9 million in fiscal 2021 compared to 8.7 million in fiscal year 2020, which represented 5.4 and 6.7 of Life Sciences Products revenue in fiscal years 2021 and 2020, respectively. The increase in research and development expenses were primarily attributable to investments in our cryogenic product line and outside services costs. Research and development expenses in our Life Sciences Services segment were 11.5 million in fiscal 2021 compared to 9.1 million in fiscal year 2020 which represented 3.7 and 3.5 of Life Sciences Services revenue for fiscal years 2021 and 2020, respectively. The increase in research and development expenses was primarily driven by higher payroll related costs and project costs. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses were 252.1 million in fiscal year 2021 as compared to 190.3 million in fiscal year 2020. The increase of 61.8 million was driven by 26.2 million from segment selling, general and administrative expenses and 35.6 million from corporate expenses not allocated to our segments. The segment selling, general and administrative expenses are discussed in further detail below. The increase in unallocated corporate

Table of Contents 
 expenses was primarily driven by mergers and acquisition related expenses, which were 20.7 million for fiscal year 2021, compared to 0.5 million in fiscal year 2020. Merger and acquisition expenses for fiscal year 2021 included 18.6 million of costs related to separation activities resulting in the sale of the semiconductor automation business. Unallocated corporate expenses also include the amortization of intangible assets primarily related to customer relationships, which were 8.1 million for both fiscal years 2021 and 2020. Fiscal year 2021 also includes 13.4 million of impairment charges to intangible assets related to tradenames. The charges were driven by the abandonment of tradenames which resulted from the rebranding of our life sciences products and life sciences services business during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021 and 0.8 million of costs related to rebranding and transformation efforts. Selling, general and administrative expenses at the segment level, which are discussed below, include corporate allocations from shared corporate function which include finance, information technology, human resources, legal, executive, governance, logistics and compliance, and variable compensation. During fiscal year 2021 corporate allocated expenses increased 10.0 million compared to fiscal year 2020, primarily due to higher variable compensation accruals and information technology infrastructure costs. Selling, general and administrative expenses in our Life Sciences Products segment were 59.7 million in fiscal year 2021 as compared to 51.2 million in fiscal year 2020. The increase of 8.5 million was due to higher sales commission expenses, variable compensation expense and corporate allocated costs, which were driven by the factors discussed above. Selling, general and administrative expenses in our Life Sciences Services segment were 129.4 million in fiscal year 2021 as compared to 111.7 million in fiscal year 2020. The increase of 17.6 million is primarily related to variable compensation expense and costs to support growth, partially offset by lower travel expenses, and lower bad debt expense Non-Operating Income (Expenses) Interest income During fiscal years 2021 and 2020, we recorded interest income of 0.6 million and 0.8 million respectively, which primarily represented interest earned on our marketable securities. Interest expense During fiscal years 2021 and 2020, we recorded interest expense of 2.0 million and 2.9 million, respectively. Interest expense is primarily related to our term loan. Other expenses, net During fiscal years 2021 and 2020 we recorded other expenses, net of 16.5 million and 1.6 million, respectively. Other expense, net for fiscal year 2021 includes a 16.0 million charge related to the release of a tax indemnification asset which is offset in the Income tax benefit line item in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. Income Tax Benefit We recorded an income tax benefit on continuing operations of 20.1 million in fiscal year 2021 compared to an income tax benefit of 13.9 million in fiscal year 2020. The income tax benefit for fiscal year 2021 was primarily driven by uncertain tax position reversals totaling 18.2 million, which includes 16.0 million of uncertain tax positions that were indemnified. The tax reserve reversal is offset by a 3.4 million tax charge related to the write off a future tax deduction that would have been recognized if the uncertain tax position was settled in an audit. The benefit also included 2.0 million of benefits related to the reversal of valuation allowances against deferred tax assets, losses in the U.S. jurisdiction and stock compensation deductions in excess of book expenses. The overall benefit for fiscal year 2021 was partially offset by 4.1 million of withholding tax costs related to repatriation of foreign earnings in connection with the planned sale of the semiconductor automation business and the tax provision on earnings in our foreign jurisdictions during the year. The income tax benefit during fiscal year 2020 was driven primarily by benefits in the U.S. jurisdiction related to continuing operations losses and stock compensation deductions in excess of book expenses. The overall benefit for fiscal year 2020 was partially offset by the tax provisions on earnings in our foreign jurisdictions during the year.

 Discontinued Operations Discontinued operations include our semiconductor automation business and our semiconductor cryogenics business. In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell our semiconductor automation business to THL for 3 billion in cash, subject to customary adjustments. The sale is expected to close in the first half of 2022. On July 1, 2019, we completed the sale of the semiconductor cryogenics business for 659.8 million in cash. Revenue from discontinued operations was 680.1 million and 508.7 million, respectively, for fiscal years 2021 and 2020 and relates to the semiconductor automation business. Net income from discontinued operations was 139.6 million and 91.2 million for fiscal years 2021 and 2020, respectively, and is comprised primarily of the results of operations of our semiconductor automation business. The income from discontinued operations only includes direct operating expenses incurred that (1) are clearly identifiable as costs being disposed of upon completion of the sale and (2) will not be continued by our company on an ongoing basis. Indirect expenses which supported the semiconductor automation business and semiconductor cryogenics business, and which remained as part of the continuing operations, are not reflected in income from discontinued operations. Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2020 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2019 Revenue We reported revenue of 388.5 million for fiscal year 2020 compared to 334.2 million for fiscal year 2019, an increase of 54.3 million, or 16 . The COVID-19 pandemic had varying impacts on our business for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020. The impacts by segment are discussed below. Our Life Sciences Products segment reported revenue of 129.8 million for fiscal year 2020 compared to 119.0 million for fiscal year 2019, an increase of 10.7 million or 9 . The increase in revenue was driven by consumables and instruments, which delivered record revenue levels driven by COVID-19 related demand, and an increase in revenue for our BioStore III Cryo systems, partially offset by decreases in revenue from automated cold sample management systems and infrastructure services revenue which were both impacted by customer site restrictions and schedule delays due to COVID-19. Our Life Sciences Services segment reported revenue of 258.8 million for fiscal year 2020 compared to 215.2 million for fiscal year 2019, an increase of 43.6 million or 20 . We reported an increase of 40.2 million from genomic services, which was composed of 20.0 million from the additional time of ownership for fiscal year 2020, compared to the prior fiscal year and 20.2 million from organic growth. Our genomic services business, which is comprised of the acquisition of GENEWIZ Group, or GENEWIZ, was acquired in November 2018. We reported an increase in Sample Repository Solutions revenue of 3.4 million primarily driven by informatics services and storage services, partially offset by declines in outsourced genomic services and transportation services, which were negatively impacted by COVID-19. Informatics revenue was primarily driven by the acquisition of RURO in February 2020. We estimate that the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our revenue for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020 was a net reduction of approximately 11 million in the aggregate primarily attributable to a slow-down in the marketplace, reflecting the absence of a portion of the workforces within our customers. This slowdown was first present in the China market in the early part of the second quarter ended March 31, 2020 and began surfacing in the rest of the world in the latter part of March 2020. Partially offsetting these declines, we experienced an increase in demand for gene synthesis services and consumables and instruments, in support of numerous activities including research and development in the areas of virus detection and vaccines. During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020, demand and shipments for certain products and services in our life sciences businesses which were impacted by COVID-19 recovered to levels we experienced prior to the pandemic. Revenue generated outside the United States amounted to 135.0 million, or 35 of total revenue, for fiscal year 2020 compared to 81.7 million, or 24 of total revenue, for fiscal year 2019.

Research and Development Expenses Research and development expenses were 17.8 million in fiscal year 2020 compared to 17.3 million in fiscal year 2019, which represented 4.6 and 5.2 of revenue, for fiscal years 2020 and 2019, respectively. Research and development expenses in our Life Sciences Products segment were 8.7 million in fiscal 2020 compared to 10.8 million in fiscal year 2019, which represented 6.7 and 9.1 of Life Sciences Products revenue for fiscal years 2020 and 2019, respectively. The decline in research and development expenses were primarily attributable to lower outside service costs and lower temporary employee costs supporting product development initiatives. 
 36 

Table of Contents 
 Research and development expenses in our Life Sciences Services segment were 9.1 million in fiscal 2020 compared to 6.5 million in fiscal year 2019, which represented 3.5 and 3.0 of Life Sciences Services revenue for fiscal years 2020 and 2019, respectively. The increase in research and development expenses was primarily driven by acquisitions. The timing of the GENEWIZ acquisition added an additional 1.1 million of expense in fiscal year 2020 and the acquisition of RURO, Inc. in February 2020 added 0.6 million of additional expense. Investments in employee related costs and outside services to support development initiatives in our service offerings drove the remainder of the increase. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses were 190.3 million in fiscal year 2020 as compared to 163.3 million in fiscal year 2019. The increase of 26.9 million was driven by 26.6 million from segment selling, general and administrative expenses and 0.3 million from corporate expenses not allocated to our segments. Selling, general and administrative expenses at the segment level, which are discussed below, include corporate allocations from shared corporate functions which include finance, information technology, human resources, legal, executive, governance, logistics and compliance, and variable compensation. During fiscal year 2020 corporate allocated expenses increased 33.8 million compared to fiscal year 2019, primarily due to the integration of the shared corporate functions from our acquisitions. Selling, general and administrative expenses in our Life Sciences Products segment were 51.2 million in fiscal year 2020 as compared to 54.9 million in fiscal year 2019. The decrease of 3.7 million is primarily due to decreases in employee related costs from restructuring actions taken in 2019 and 2020 and decreases in expenses related to employee travel, trade shows, and conferences, partially offset by higher corporate allocated costs and higher sales commissions. Selling, general and administrative expenses in our Life Sciences Services segment were 111.7 million in fiscal year 2020 as compared to 81.4 million in fiscal year 2019. The increase of 30.4 million is primarily related to acquisitions, corporate allocations, and bad debt expense, partially offset by lower employee travel expense. The timing of the GENEWIZ acquisition added an additional 5.1 million of expense and the RURO acquisition added 1.2 million of additional expense in fiscal year 2020. Non-Operating Income (Expenses) Interest income During fiscal years 2020 and 2019, we recorded interest income of 0.8 million and 1.4 million respectively, which primarily represented interest earned on our marketable securities. Interest expense During fiscal years 2020 and 2019, we recorded interest expense of 2.9 million and 22.2 million, respectively. The decrease in interest expense in the fiscal year 2020 compared to the prior fiscal year is due to carrying less debt. We extinguished 495.3 million of debt during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019. Loss on extinguishment of debt - During fiscal year 2019, we recorded losses on extinguishment of debt of 14.3 million of which 9.1 million was in connection with the syndication of the incremental term loan secured during the first quarter of fiscal 2019. The syndication to a new group of lenders during the second quarter of fiscal 2019 met the criteria of a debt extinguishment and therefore the amortization of the deferred financing costs associated with the origination of the incremental term loan was accelerated and recorded as a loss on extinguishment of debt in our Consolidated Statement of Operations. In addition, as a result of the 495.3 million extinguishment of debt during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019, we recorded an additional 5.2 million loss on extinguishment of debt. Other expenses, net During fiscal years 2020 and 2019 we recorded other expenses, net of 1.6 million and 1.4 million, respectively. Income Tax Benefit We recorded an income tax benefit on continuing operations of 13.9 million in fiscal year 2020 compared to an income tax benefit of 22.8 million in fiscal year 2019. The income tax benefit during fiscal year 2020 was driven primarily by benefits in the U.S. jurisdiction related to continuing operations losses and stock compensation deductions

 in excess of book expenses. The overall benefit for fiscal year 2020 was partially offset by the tax provisions on earnings in our foreign jurisdictions during the year. The income tax benefit during fiscal year 2019 was driven primarily by benefits in the U.S. jurisdiction related to continuing operations losses, research tax credits, and stock compensation deductions in excess of book expenses. We also recorded a 1.4 million benefit due to a state tax change that resulted from the acquisition of GENEWIZ. We also recorded a tax provision of 3.0 million during the year related to changes in the toll charge based on a change in tax legislation and the completion of all accounting of the charge under SAB 118. The overall benefit for fiscal year 2019 was partially offset by the tax provisions on earnings in our foreign jurisdictions during the year. Discontinued Operations As discussed above, discontinued operations include the results of the semiconductor automation business and the results of the semiconductor cryogenics business, which was sold on July 1, 2019. The sale of the semiconductor automation business is expected to be completed during the first half of the calendar year 2022. Revenue from discontinued operations was 508.7 million and 556.2 million, respectively, for fiscal years 2020 and 2019, respectively. Revenue from discontinued operations for fiscal year 2020 relates to the semiconductor automation business. Revenue from discontinued operations for fiscal year 2019 includes 446.7 million related to the semiconductor automation business and 109.5 million related to the semiconductor cryogenics business. Net income from discontinued operations was 91.2 million for fiscal year 2020 and is comprised primarily of our semiconductor automation business. Net income for fiscal 2019 was 498.5 million and includes the net gain on sale of the semiconductor cryogenics business of 408.6 million. The net income for fiscal year 2019 is also inclusive of income from the ULVAC Cryogenics, Inc. joint venture. The income from discontinued operations only includes direct operating expenses incurred that (1) are clearly identifiable as costs being disposed of upon completion of the sale and (2) will not be continued by the Company on an ongoing basis. Indirect expenses which supported the semiconductor automation business and cryogenics business, and which remained as part of the continuing operations, are not reflected in income from discontinued operations. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES We believe that we have adequate resources to satisfy our working capital, financing activities, debt service and capital expenditure requirements for the next twelve months. The current global economic environment, including the uncertainty related to the short and long-term impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, make it difficult for us to predict longer-term liquidity requirements with sufficient certainty. We may be unable to obtain any required additional financing on terms favorable to us, if at all. If adequate funds are not available to us on acceptable terms or otherwise, we may be unable to successfully develop or enhance products and services, respond to competitive pressure or take advantage of acquisition opportunities, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. The discussion of our cash flows and liquidity that follows does not include the impact of any adjustments to remove discontinued operations, unless otherwise noted, and is stated on a total company consolidated basis.

Year Ended September 30, 2021 2020 Cash and cash equivalents 227,427 250,649 Restricted cash 12,906 6,877 Short-term marketable securities 81 51 Long-term marketable securities 3,598 3,101 244,012 260,678 Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash 240,333 257,526 Cash and cash equivalents included in assets held for sale 45,000 45,000 285,333 302,526 Our cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and marketable securities were 244.0 million as of September 30, 2021 and exclude 45 million of cash included within assets held for sale related to the semiconductor automation business. As of September 30, 2021, we had cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash including cash in assets held for sale of 285.3 million, of which 169.6 million was held outside of the United States. If these funds are needed for the United States operations, we would need to repatriate these funds. As a result of recent changes in U.S. tax legislation, any repatriation in the future would likely not result in U.S. federal income tax. During the quarter ended September 30, 2021 we repatriated foreign cash to the U.S. in planning for the sale of the discontinued operation and recognized all related tax costs. We have provided immaterial deferred income taxes for the impact of these future repatriations. Aside from these actions, our intent is to reinvest the remaining foreign cash. Aside from these actions, our intent is to reinvest the remaining foreign cash outside of the United States and our current operating plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate these funds for our U.S. operations. We had marketable securities of 3.7 million and 3.2 million as of September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Our marketable securities are generally readily convertible to cash without an adverse impact. Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2021 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2020 Overview Cash Flows and Liquidity - Cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash as presented on our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows is on a total company basis and were 285.3 million as of September 30, 2021 compared to 302.5 million as of September 30, 2020. The decrease of 17.2 million included cash outflows for investing activities of 146.3 million and financing activities of 25.9 million, partially offset by cash inflows from operating activities of 149.9 million. The effects of foreign exchange positively impacted the annual change in balances by 5.2 million. Operating Activities Cash flows from operating activities can fluctuate significantly from period to period as earnings, working capital needs and the timing of payments for income taxes, restructuring activities and other charges impact reported cash flows. Cash flows from operating activities of 149.9 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021, resulted from net income 110.7 million, adjusted to exclude the effect of non-cash operating charges of 90.3 million, partially offset by an increase in net operating assets of 51.2 million. Cash outflows from the increase in net operating assets were primarily driven by increases in accounts receivable, inventory, and prepaids and other assets partially offset by increases in accounts payable, accrued expenses, and other liabilities and accrued compensation and tax withholdings. Cash flows from operating activities of 37.9 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020, resulted from net income of 64.9 million, adjusted to exclude the effect of non-cash operating charges of 77.2 million, partially

 offset by an increase in net operating assets of 12.7 million. Additionally, the company paid 91.5 million in cash taxes related to the sale of the semiconductor cryogenics business. Cash outflows related to the increase in net operating assets were primarily driven by increases in accounts receivable, inventory, and decreases in accrued expenses and other liabilities, partially offset by increased accrued compensation and tax withholdings. Discontinued operations contributed 139.6 million of net income to fiscal year 2021 and 91.2 million of net income to fiscal year 2020 referenced above. The pending sale of the semiconductor automation business may have a negative impact on cash flows from operations in future periods after the sale is completed. Investing Activities Cash used in investing activities was 146.3 million during fiscal year 2021 and consisted of 95.5 million for acquisitions and 52.8 million for capital expenditures, partially offset by 2.0 million of proceeds from the collection of loans receivable. Capital expenditures were made primarily to increase capacity, support new product development, and enhance information technology infrastructure. Capital expenditures for the fiscal year 2021 included 35.6 million for construction in process of a building site in Suzhou, China. The site is intended to consolidate operations of three leased sites in the same region, while expanding operational capacity. Cash used in investing activities was 22.7 million during fiscal year 2020 and consisted of 39.9 million for capital expenditures and 15.7 million for acquisitions, partially offset by 33.9 million of net proceeds from the net purchases, sales, and maturities of marketable securities. Financing Activities Cash used for financing activities was 25.9 million during fiscal year 2021 and included net cash outflows for cash dividends paid of 29.7 million, 1.2 million in payment of finance leases and 0.8 million of debt principal payments. Partially offsetting these cash outflows was 5.8 million related to the proceeds from issuance of common stock. Cash used for financing activities was 27.0 million during fiscal year 2020 and included net cash outflows for cash dividends paid of 29.5 million, 1.3 million in payment of finance leases and 0.8 million of debt principal payments. Partially offsetting these cash outflows was 4.6 million related to the proceeds from issuance of common stock. China Facility In April 2019, we committed to construct a facility in Suzhou China, to consolidate the Suzhou operations of our genomic services business and provide infrastructure to support future growth. The facility is being constructed in two phases. We have incurred 35.6 million of capital expenditures to date related to the construction of the facility, which includes 26.0 million and 8.3 million, respectively, for fiscal years 2021 and 2020, respectively. Capital Resources Term Loans On October 4, 2017, we entered into a 200.0 million term loan with Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc., JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and Wells Fargo Securities, LLC pursuant to the terms of a credit agreement with the lenders. The term loan was issued at 197.6 million, or 98.8 of its par value, resulting in a discount of 2.4 million, or 1.2 , which represented loan origination fees paid at the closing. The loan principal amount may be increased by an aggregate amount equal to 75.0 million plus any voluntary repayments of the term loan plus any additional amount such that our secured leverage ratio is less than 3.00 to 1.00. The term loan matures and becomes fully payable on October 4, 2024. Installment principal payments equal to 0.25 of the initial principal amount of the term loan are payable on the last day of each quarter, with any remaining principal amount becoming due and payable on the maturity date. Subject to certain conditions stated in the credit agreement, we may redeem the term loan at any time at our option without a significant premium or penalty, except for a repricing transaction, as defined in the credit agreement. We are required to redeem the term loan at the principal amount then outstanding upon the occurrence of certain events, as set forth in the credit agreement.

 On November 15, 2018, we entered into an incremental amendment to the credit agreement under which we obtained an incremental term loan in an aggregate principal amount of 350.0 million, issued at 340.5 million. The proceeds of the incremental term loan were used to pay a portion of the purchase price for our acquisition of GENEWIZ. On February 15, 2019, we entered into the second amendment to the credit agreement and syndicated the incremental term loan to a group of new lenders. The syndicated incremental term loan was issued at 345.2 million. Except as provided for in the amendments, the incremental term loan was subject to the same terms and conditions of the initial term loan. On July 1, 2019, in connection with the completion of the sale of our semiconductor cryogenics business, we used 348.3 million of the cash proceeds from the transaction to extinguish the outstanding balance at July 1, 2019 of the incremental term loan and 147.0 million of the cash proceeds from the transaction to extinguish a portion of the outstanding balance at July 1, 2019 of the term loan. The total amount of debt extinguished on July 1, 2019 was 495.3 million. The credit agreement, as amended, for contains certain customary representations and warranties, covenants and events of default. As of September 30, 2021, we were in compliance with all covenants and conditions under the credit agreement, as amended. In connection with our acquisition of GENEWIZ in November 2018, we assumed three five-year term loans and two one-year term loans. The two one-year short term loans matured and were repaid in full as of September 30, 2020. The three five-year term loans matured and were repaid in full during fiscal year 2021. At September 30, 2021, the aggregate outstanding principal balance of all outstanding term loans was 49.7 million, excluding unamortized deferred financing costs of 0.3 million. Borrowings under the term loans bear variable interest rates. As a result, we may experience exposure to interest rate risk due to the potential volatility associated with the variable interest rates on the term loans. If rates increase, we may be subject to higher costs of servicing the loans which could reduce our profitability and cash flows. During the year ended September 30, 2021, the weighted average stated interest rate on the term loans was 2.8 . During the year ended September 30, 2021, we incurred aggregate interest expense of 1.7 million on the term loans, including 0.2 million of deferred financing costs amortization. Our debt service requirements are expected to be funded through our existing sources of liquidity and operating cash flows. Line of Credit Facility We maintain a revolving line of credit under a credit agreement with Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A that provides for a revolving credit facility of up to 75.0 million, subject to borrowing base availability, as defined in the credit agreement. The line of credit matures on October 4, 2022. The proceeds from the line of credit are available for permitted acquisitions and general corporate purposes. As of September 30, 2021, we had approximately 57.7 million available for borrowing under the line of credit. There were no amounts outstanding pursuant to the line of credit as of September 30, 2021. The amount of funds available for borrowing under the credit agreement may fluctuate each period based on our borrowing base availability. The credit agreement contains certain customary representations and warranties, a financial covenant, affirmative and negative covenants, as well as events of default. We were in compliance with the credit agreement as of September 30, 2021. Although we believe we will be able to generate sufficient cash in the United States and foreign jurisdictions to fund future operating costs, we secured the revolving line of credit as an additional assurance for maintaining liquidity in the United States for strategic investments and acquisitions.

 Dividends Our Board of Directors declared the following dividends during the fiscal years 2021 and 2020(in thousands, except per share data): 

Dividend per Record Payment Declaration Date Share Date Date Total Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2021 November 5, 2020 0.10 December 4, 2020 December 17, 2020 7,421 January 25, 2021 0.10 March 5, 2021 March 26, 2021 7,429 April 27, 2021 0.10 June 4, 2021 June 25, 2021 7,430 August 3, 2021 0.10 September 3, 2021 September 24, 2021 7,435 Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2020 November 1, 2019 0.10 December 6, 2019 December 20, 2019 7,362 January 24, 2020 0.10 March 6, 2020 March 27, 2020 7,375 April 29, 2020 0.10 June 5, 2020 June 26, 2020 7,376 July 29, 2020 0.10 September 4, 2020 September 25, 2020 7,383 On November 2, 2021, our Board of Directors approved a cash dividend of 0.10 per share of our common stock. The total dividend of approximately 7.5 million will be paid on December 23, 2021 to shareholders of record at the close of business on December 3, 2021. Dividends are declared at the discretion of our Board of Directors and depend on actual cash flow from operations, our financial condition, debt service and capital requirements and any other factors our Board of Directors may consider relevant. On November 16, 2021 at our investor day conference, we disclosed that we intend to discontinue paying a quarterly dividend upon the completion of the sale of our semiconductor automation business. Share Repurchase Program On September 29, 2015, our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program for up to 50.0 million worth of our common stock. The timing and amount of any shares repurchased are based on market and business conditions, legal requirements and other factors and may be commenced or suspended at any time at our discretion. There were no shares repurchased under this program during fiscal year 2021. Contractual Obligations and Requirements At September 30, 2021, we had non-cancelable commitments of 65.9 million, including purchase orders for inventory of 44.0 million, information technology related commitments of 15.9 million and China facility commitments of 6.0 million related to the construction of our facility in China discussed above. At September 30, 2021, the Company had 1.3 million of letters of credit outstanding related primarily to customer advances and other performance obligations. These arrangements guarantee the refund of advance payments received from our customers in the event that the product is not delivered, or warranty obligations are not fulfilled in accordance with the contract terms. These obligations could be called by the beneficiaries at any time before the expiration date of the particular letter of credit if we fail to meet certain contractual requirements. None of these obligations were called during fiscal year 2021, and we currently do not anticipate any of these obligations to be called in the near future. As of September 30, 2021, the total amount of net unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions and the accrual for the related interest was 2.0 million, all of which represents a potential future cash outlay, in comparison to September 30, 2020 where the balance was 18.5 million. The decrease in the balance over the year was primarily driven by many of our accruals on our preexisting unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions reaching their statute of limitations. We are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of the cash settlement for these liabilities since the timing of future tax examinations by various tax jurisdictions and the related resolution is uncertain.

 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are exposed to a variety of market risks, including changes in interest rates affecting the return on our cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and short-term and long-term investments and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Interest Rate Exposure Our term loan bears variable interest rates which subjects us to interest rate risk. Our primary interest rate risk exposure results from changes in the short-term LIBOR rate, the federal funds effective rate and the prime rate. As of September 30, 2021, the weighted average stated interest rate on our debt was 2.8 . At September 30, 2021, the outstanding term loan principal balance was 49.7 million, excluding unamortized deferred financing costs of 0.3 million. During fiscal year 2021, we incurred aggregate interest expense of 1.7 million on all of our term loans. A hypothetical 100 basis point change in interest rates would result in a 0.5 million change in interest expense incurred during fiscal year 2021. Our cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash consist principally of money market securities which are short-term in nature. At September 30, 2021 and 2020, our aggregate short-term and long-term investments were 3.7 million and 3.2 million, respectively, and consisted mostly of highly rated corporate debt securities and municipal securities. At September 30, 2021 and 2020, the unrealized loss position on marketable securities was insignificant, which is included in Accumulated other comprehensive income in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. A hypothetical 100 basis point change in interest rates would result in an insignificant annual change in interest income earned in fiscal year 2021. Currency Rate Exposure We have transactions and balances denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Most of these transactions or balances are denominated in Euros, British Pounds and a variety of Asian currencies. Sales in currencies other than the U.S. dollar were 37 and 33 , respectively, of our total sales for fiscal years ended September 30, 2021 and 2020. These sales were made primarily by our foreign subsidiaries, which have cost structures that substantially align with the currency of sale. In the normal course of our business, we have liquid assets denominated in non-functional currencies which include cash, short-term advances between our legal entities and accounts receivable which are subject to foreign currency exposure. Such balances were approximately 119.4 million and 142.9 million, respectively, at September 30, 2021 and 2020, and related to the Euro, British Pound and a variety of Asian currencies. We mitigate the impact of potential currency translation losses on these short-term intercompany advances by the timely settlement of each transaction, generally within 30 days. We also utilize forward contracts to mitigate our exposures to currency movement. We incurred foreign currency losses of 1.8 million and 3.4 million, respectively, in fiscal years 2021 and 2020, which related to the currency fluctuation on these balances between the time the transaction occurred and the ultimate settlement of the transaction. A hypothetical 10 change in foreign exchange rates would result in a change of 3.7 million and 1.4 million, respectively, in our net income during fiscal years 2021 and 2020.

 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Brooks Automation, Inc. Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Brooks Automation, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the Company as of September 30, 2021 and 2020, and the related consolidated statements of operations, of comprehensive income, of changes in stockholders equity and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2021, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements ). We also have audited the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of September 30, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2021 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO. Change in Accounting Principle As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts for leases effective October 1, 2019. Basis for Opinions The Company s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company s consolidated financial statements and on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we

 considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Critical Audit Matters The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. Acquisition of Precise Automation Inc. Valuation of Completed Technology As described in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, on April 29, 2021, the Company acquired Precise Automation Inc. for a total cash purchase price of 69.8 million. As part of the preliminary purchase price allocation, management recorded 38.7 million for the completed technology intangible asset which was valued using the excess earnings method under the income approach. As disclosed by management, management applied significant judgment in estimating the fair value of the completed technology, which involved significant estimates and assumptions with respect to forecast revenue growth rates and the discount rate. The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the acquisition of Precise Automation Inc. valuation of completed technology is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment by management when determining the fair value of the completed technology, which in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating management s assumptions related to forecast revenue growth rates and the discount rate. In addition, the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge. Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the acquisition accounting, including controls over management s valuation of the completed technology and assumptions related to forecast revenue growth rates and the discount rate. These procedures also included, among others, (i) testing management s process for determining the fair value of the completed technology, (ii) evaluating the appropriateness of the excess earnings method, (iii) testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data used in the method, and 
 46 

Table of Contents 
 (iv) evaluating the reasonableness of significant assumptions used by management related to forecast revenue growth rates and the discount rate. Evaluating management s assumptions related to forecast revenue growth rates involved evaluating whether the assumptions used were reasonable considering the past performance of the acquired business, performance year to date, available backlog, and industry data. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in evaluating the appropriateness of the excess earnings method and the reasonableness of the discount rate. /s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP Boston, Massachusetts November 24, 2021 We have served as the Company s auditor since 2016.

 million and million, respectively, associated with the development of software for its internal use. As of September 30, 2021, this balance included million associated with software still in the development stage which are included within Property, plant and equipment, net in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. During fiscal year 2021, the Company capitalized direct costs of million associated with the development of software for its internal use. Cost of disposed assets and the associated accumulated depreciation are derecognized upon their retirement or at the time of disposal, and the resulting gain or loss is included in the Company s results of operations. The Company identified finite-lived intangible assets other than goodwill as a result of acquisitions. Finite-lived intangible assets are valued based on estimated future cash flows and amortized over their estimated useful lives based on methods that approximate the pattern in which the economic benefits are expected to be realized. Finite-lived intangibles assets and fixed assets are tested for impairment when indicators of impairment are present. For purposes of this test, long-lived assets are grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. If the Company determines that indicators of potential impairment are present, it assesses the recoverability of long-lived asset group by comparing its undiscounted future cash flows to its carrying value. The future cash flow period is based on the future service life of the primary asset within the long-lived asset group. If the carrying value of the long-lived asset group exceeds its future cash flows, the Company determines fair values of the individual net assets within the long-lived asset group to assess potential impairment. If the aggregate fair values of the individual net assets of the group are less than their carrying values, an impairment loss is recognized for an amount in excess of the group s aggregate carrying value over its fair value. The loss is allocated to the assets within the group based on their relative carrying values, with no asset reduced below its fair value. Finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their useful lives, as follows: - Patents Completed technology - Customer relationships - 
 Topic 842 effective using the modified retrospective approach . The Company applied Topic 842 to all its leases as of October 1, 2019. The Company has operating leases for real estate and non-real estate and finance leases for non-real estate. The classification of a lease as operating or finance and the determination of the right-of-use asset ROU asset and lease liability are determined at lease inception. The ROU asset represents the Company s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and the lease liability represents the Company s obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. As most of the Company s leases do not provide an implicit rate, an incremental borrowing rate is used based on the estimated rate of interest for collateralized borrowing over a similar term of the lease payments at commencement date. Lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the option will be exercised. Lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

 Revenue from the sales of certain products that involve significant customization, which include primarily automated cold sample management systems is recognized over time as the asset created by the Company s performance does not have alternative use to the Company and an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date is present. The Company recognizes revenue as work progresses based on a percentage of actual labor hours incurred on the project to-date and total estimated labor hours expected to be incurred on the project. The selection of the method to measure progress towards completion requires judgment. The Company has concluded that using the percentage of labor hours incurred to estimated labor hours needed to complete the project most appropriately depicts the Company s efforts towards satisfaction of the performance obligation. The Company develops profit estimates for long-term contracts based on total revenue expected to be generated from the project and total costs anticipated to be incurred in the project. These estimates are based on a number of factors, including the degree of required product customization and the work required to be able to install the product in the customer s existing environment, as well as the Company s historical experience, project plans and an assessment of the risks and uncertainties inherent in the contract related to implementation delays or performance issues that may or may not be within the Company s control. The Company estimates a loss on a contract by comparing total estimated contract revenue to the total estimated contract costs and recognizes a loss during the period in which it becomes probable and can be reasonably estimated.

 million in cash, subject to adjustments. On July 1, 2019, the Company completed the sale of the semiconductor cryogenics business for million, which excludes million retained by Edwards at closing based on an estimate of net working capital adjustments, which are currently pending finalization. Net proceeds from the sale were approximately million, net of taxes and closing costs paid and remaining estimated taxes payable. As part of this sale, we transferred our intellectual property, or IP, for our cryogenics pump products, but not our IP related to our semiconductor automation or life sciences businesses. Net income from discontinued operations for fiscal year 2019 is inclusive of the net gain on sale of million. In the third quarter of fiscal year 2020, Edwards asserted claims for indemnification under the definitive agreement relating to alleged breaches of representations and warranties relating to customer warranty claims and inventory. The Company cannot determine the probability of any losses or outcome of these claims including the amount of any indemnifiable losses, if any, resulting from these claims at this time, however, the Company believes that none of these claims will have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position or results of operations. If the resolution of these claims results in indemnifiable losses in excess of the applicable indemnification deductibles and indemnification escrow established under the definitive agreement, Edwards would be required to seek recovery under the representation and warranty insurance Edwards obtained in connection with the closing of the transaction. The Company believes that any indemnifiable losses in excess of the applicable deductibles and indemnification escrow established in the definitive agreement would be covered by such insurance. If Edwards is unable to obtain recovery under its insurance, however, it could seek recovery of such indemnifiable losses, if any, directly from the Company s continuing operation. The semiconductor cryogenics business consisted of the CTI pump business, Polycold chiller business, the related services business and a share in Ulvac Cryogenics, Inc., a joint venture based in Japan. The semiconductor cryogenics business was originally acquired by the Company in its 2005 merger with Helix Technology Corporation. The operating results of the semiconductor cryogenics business had been included in the Brooks Semiconductor Solutions Group segment before the plan of disposition. In connection with the closing of the Disposition on July 1, 2019, the Company and Edwards entered into a transition service agreement, a supply agreement, and lease agreements. The transition service agreement outlined the information technology, people, and facility support the parties provided to each other for the period ending after transaction closing date. The supply agreement allowed the Company to purchase CTI and Polycold goods at cost from Edwards up to an aggregate amount equal to million until anniversary of closing the Disposition. The lease agreements provide facility space in Chelmsford, Massachusetts to Edwards free of charge for after the transaction closing date. Edwards has the each lease at the then current market rates after the initial lease term has ended. This Disposition is consistent with the Company s long-standing strategy to increase shareholder value by accelerating the growth of its Life Sciences businesses with further acquisitions and strengthening its semiconductor automation business with opportunistic acquisitions. The semiconductor cryogenics business disposition met the held for sale criteria and the discontinued operation criteria in accordance with ASC 205 as of September 30, 2018. As such, its operating results have been reported as a discontinued operation for all periods presented.

GENEWIZ provides genomics services that enable research scientists to advance their discoveries within the pharmaceutical, academic, biotechnology, agriculture and other markets. It provides gene sequencing and synthesis services for more than institutional customers worldwide supported by their global network of laboratories spanning the United States, China, Japan, Germany and the United Kingdom. This transaction has added a new and innovative platform which further enhances the Company s core capabilities and the opportunity to add even more value to samples that are under the Company s care. The total cash purchase price for the acquisition was million, net of cash acquired, which included a working capital settlement of million. The Company used the proceeds of the incremental term loan described in Note 11, Debt to pay a portion of the purchase price. On the acquisition date, the Company paid million to escrow accounts related to the satisfaction of the seller s indemnification obligations with respect to their representations and warranties and other indemnities. The Company also retained an amount equal to million as collateral for any adjustment shortfall based on the final merger consideration calculation. During the fiscal year 2019, the final merger consideration was calculated to be million less than the merger consideration paid at closing. To satisfy the shortfall, the Company reversed the million liability associated with the holdback, received approval from the former shareholders to retain million of funds the Company received on their behalf, and collected million from the escrow accounts. The Company recorded the assets acquired and liabilities assumed related to GENEWIZ at their fair values as of the acquisition date, from a market participant s perspective. Fair value estimates are based on a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties and rely heavily on estimates and assumptions. The judgments used to determine the estimated fair value assigned to each class of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, as well as asset lives, can materially impact the Company s results of operations. The following table presents the net purchase price and the fair values of the assets and liabilities of GENEWIZ (in thousands): Inventories Prepaid expenses and other current assets Property, plant and equipment Goodwill Intangible assets Other assets Current portion of long-term debt ) Accounts payable ) Deferred revenue ) Accrued compensation and benefits ) Other current liabilities ) Long-term debt ) Long-term tax reserves ) Long-term deferred tax liabilities ) Other long-term liabilities ) Total purchase price, net of cash acquired

The Company reviews the marketable securities for impairment at each reporting period to determine if any of the securities have experienced an other-than-temporary decline in fair value. The Company considers factors, such as the length of time and extent to which the market value has been less than the cost, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer, the Company s intent to sell, or whether it is more likely than not it will be required to sell the investment before recovery of its amortized cost basis. If the Company believes that an other-than-temporary decline in fair value has occurred, it writes down the investment to fair value and recognizes the credit loss in earnings and the non-credit loss in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss.

The reporting units within the continuing operations include Life Sciences Products as the only reporting unit within the Life Sciences Products segment, and Sample Repository Solutions and Genomic Services within the Life Sciences Services segment. Based on the test results, the Company determined that adjustment to goodwill was necessary. The Company conducted a qualitative assessment for the Life Science Products reporting unit and determined that it was more likely than not that its fair value was greater than its carrying value. As a result of the analysis, the Company did not perform the quantitative assessment for this reporting unit, and therefore, did not recognize any impairment losses. The Company performed the quantitative goodwill impairment test for the reporting units within the Life Sciences Services segment. The Company determined that adjustment to goodwill was necessary for these reporting units. Both reporting units fair values significantly exceeded their respective book values. Immediately post to the annual goodwill impairment test, the Company combined two components within the Life Sciences Services operating segment, Sample Repository Solutions and Genomic Services components, into the Life Sciences Services reporting unit. The Company evaluated the aggregation criteria under ASC 350 for the two components and concluded that they exhibit similar economic characteristics and meet the aggregation criteria. Post to this aggregation, the Company has two reporting units which includes the Life Sciences Products and the Life Sciences Services reporting units.

ASC Topic 740 requires that all available evidence, both positive and negative, be considered in determining, based on the weight of that evidence, whether a valuation allowance is needed. The weight given to the potential effect of negative and positive evidence should be commensurate with the extent to which it can be objectively verified. The more negative evidence that exists, (a) the more positive evidence is necessary and (b) the more difficult it is to support a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not needed for some portion or the entire deferred tax asset. A cumulative loss in recent years is considered a significant piece of negative evidence that is difficult to overcome in assessing the need for a valuation allowance. The Company evaluates the realizability of its deferred tax assets by tax-paying component and assesses the need for a valuation allowance on an annual and quarterly basis. The Company evaluates the profitability of each tax-paying component on a historic cumulative basis and a forward-looking basis in the course of performing this analysis. After evaluating all the relevant positive and negative evidence, the Company reduced its valuation allowance against certain foreign net deferred tax assets resulting in a tax benefit of million in fiscal year 2021. The Company continued to hold a U.S. valuation allowance related to the realizability of certain state tax credits and net operating loss carry-forwards. The Company also maintains valuation allowances against net deferred tax assets in certain foreign tax-paying components as of the end of fiscal year 2021.

As a result of this clarification, the Company recorded an increase to the toll charge of million. After all adjustments had been recorded, the Company realized a toll charge of million, net of foreign tax credits. The Company has performed studies to determine if there are any annual limitations on the federal net operating losses under the Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Internal Revenue Code. As a result of these studies, the Company has determined that ownership changes have occurred primarily in connection with acquisitions when the Company has issued stock to the sellers, as well as ownership changes in the subsidiaries acquired by the Company.

Purchase Commitments At September 30, 2021, the Company has non-cancelable commitments of million, including purchase orders for inventory of million, information technology related commitments of million, and China facility commitments of million. Contingencies The Company is subject to various legal proceedings, both asserted and unasserted, that arise in the ordinary course of business. The Company cannot predict the ultimate outcome of such legal proceedings or in certain instances provide reasonable ranges of potential losses. The Company may also have certain indemnification obligations pursuant to claims made under the definitive agreement it entered into with Edwards in connection with the Company s sale of its semiconductor cryogenics business. See Note 3, Discontinued Operations for further information. However, as of the date of this report, the Company believes that none of these claims will have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position or results of operations. In the event of unexpected subsequent developments and given the inherent unpredictability of these matters, there can be no assurance that the Company s assessment of any claim will reflect the ultimate outcome, and an adverse outcome in certain matters could, from time to time, have a material adverse effect on the Company s consolidated financial position or results of operations in particular quarterly or annual periods.

 Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Financial Accounting and Financial Disclosure Not applicable. Item 9A. Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined under Rule 13a-15(e) promulgated under the Exchange Act. Disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based upon this evaluation, our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2021, the end of the period covered by this annual report. Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act, as a process designed by, or under the supervision of our chief executive and chief financial officers and effected by our board of directors, management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United Sates, or GAAP and includes those policies and procedures that: pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and disposition of our assets; provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorization of our management and directors; and provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risks that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, we conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2021. In making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations (COSO) of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, management concluded that the Company s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of September 30, 2021. The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2021 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Form 10-K.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company may elect to have the Award, in whole or in part, continue to vest during any period in which the Participant serves as a consultant to the Company upon termination of employment. However, a change in the Participant s employment status from full-time to part-time shall not affect the Award, which shall continue to vest in accordance with the terms described herein. In addition, if the Participant is employed by a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company and such subsidiary is subsequently sold or transferred to another Person (as defined below) who is not also wholly owned by the Company, then the Participant s employment with the Company for purposes of this Section 5 shall be deemed to cease immediately upon such sale or transfer. 6.
