1. Business. 

General
Development of Business 

We
were incorporated on November 18, 2020 under the laws of the State of Wyoming. 

We
intend to complete the development of and operate a ride-hailing and food delivery computer and mobile device application known as WarpSpeedTaxi .
A ride-hailing service, also known as app-taxi, e-taxi, or a mobility service provider, is a service that, via websites and mobile apps,
matches passengers with drivers of vehicles for hire that are not licensed taxi drivers. The computer application that we are developing
is intended to provide travelers with convenient door-to-door transport that leverages smart mobility platforms to connect drivers with
passengers and lets drivers use their personal vehicles. Ride-hailing, like a traditional taxi service, facilitates drivers providing
rides to customers for a fee. However, ride-hailing offers additional capabilities, such as efficient pricing tools, matching platforms,
rating systems, and food delivery. 

We
acquired the WarpSpeedTaxi application in its current phase of development from a private Wyoming corporation for total consideration
of 300,000 payable in stages. Our acquisition of the application includes a 100 interest in all software comprising the application,
as well as the corresponding website domain, content, and all incorporated technology. We will jointly own the operational data and databases
relating to the application with the vendor. However, the vendor is not permitted to use the data for any purpose that competes directly
or indirectly with our use and operation of the application for ride-hailing and food delivery. 

To
date, we have paid the vendor 10,000. We owe the vendor an additional 40,000 upon its delivery of a working prototype of the application
to us, which development we will fund. We anticipate that we will need to spend an additional 10,000 in order to complete the computer
application. We have also issued the vendor a promissory note for the balance of the purchase price of 250,000, which is due upon demand
provided that the vendor cannot demand payment of the note until after December 31, 2023. The note bears simple interest at a rate of
5 per year. There is no penalty if we decide to pay the note at any time prior to December 31, 2023. 

We
anticipate that our WarpSpeedTaxi application will allow customers to hire a standard and luxury motor vehicles via a smartphone or personal
computer for both one-way and round-trips with the price based on the distance travelled and the current level of demand for vehicles.
In addition to transporting passengers, the application may also be used for deliveries of goods from restaurants, grocery stores, and
other businesses that typically utilize local vehicle courier services. 

Customers
will use the application to request a ride or the delivery of goods. Drivers that we recruit and approve, through confirmation of no
criminal record, a clean driving history, and access to a suitable insured vehicle, will act as independent contractors and set their
own work hours. They will connect with customers via our application, pick up customers or goods to be delivered in accordance with the
customer s request, and then drive the customers or goods to their destination. Customers will pay for the transportation through
the application by way of credit card. Drivers will receive payments for each ride or delivery they complete via a weekly direct deposit
to their bank accounts. 

When
a customer uses the WarpSpeedTaxi application for ride-hailing, we will charge the customer a flat fee of approximately 2.00 for each
ride plus an amount for each mile that the customer travels. The amount for each mile will vary depending on the city in which the customer
is located. It will be higher in more densely populated cities where traffic moves relatively slowly and lower in less densely population
cities will less traffic congestion. Additionally, we will charge customers an additional premium during busy times when customer demand
exceeds the number of available drivers. This increase in pricing is intended to incentivize drivers to work during peak demand times
since they will receive greater compensation. In order to encourage drivers to work as independent contractors for us, we will initially
retain 15 of all revenue that a customer pays for a ride with the remaining 85 compensating the driver for his or her time and vehicle
expenses. Drivers will also retain 100 of all tips that customers provide them. Over time, when we have established a market for our
services, we may adjust this percentage so that we retain a greater percentage of revenue. 

When
a restaurant uses the food delivery service feature of our WarpSpeedTaxi application, we will charge restaurants between 5 and 15 of
their order revenue, subject to a set minimum amount, depending on the amount of business that we receive from delivery orders of their
food through our application. From these proceeds, we will pay our drivers a base fee for deliveries that depend on the distance that
they must travel to pick up the food and deliver it to the customer. In addition, the driver will retain any tips that the customer provides.

Impact
of COVID-19 Pandemic 

The
COVID-19 pandemic is likely to impact our ability to conduct our business as planned. Our ability to successfully develop our business
is subject to uncertainties surrounding the duration and severity of the pandemic, including the efficacy and availability of vaccines,
the effectiveness of vaccines on limiting or eliminating the spread of the COVID-19 virus including current virus variants and those
that may emerge in the future. 

While
the demand for food delivery services has increased since the beginning of the pandemic, the demand for ride hailing has decreased. Two
of the largest competitors in the sector, Uber and Lyft, have reported that their ridership has dropped by between 70 and 80 during
the pandemic and have suffered large losses as a result despite the increase in food delivery services. We cannot predict whether these
trends will continue and what impact they may have on our ability to generate revenue and eventually enjoy profitable operations. 

The
continued prevalence of COVID-19 nationally and globally could have an adverse impact on our business, operations, and financial results.
The related disruptions that we may experience include a decrease in demand for ride hailing services due to customers wanting to avoid
potential exposure to our drivers, increased unwillingness of drivers to risk interacting with customers in the confined environment
of motor vehicles, restrictions on our drivers ability to access certain areas due to imposed restrictions, and restrictions that
we must impose on drivers and customers in order to ensure their safety. 

The
COVID-19 pandemic could also adversely affect our liquidity and ability to access the capital markets. Uncertainty regarding the duration
of the COVID-19 pandemic may adversely impact our ability to raise additional capital. The extent of the impact of COVID-19 on our business
and financial results will also depend on future developments, including the duration and spread of the pandemic and different COVID
variants, the implementation or recurrence of shelter in place or similar orders in the future, its impact on the financial markets in
which we operate, new information that may emerge concerning the severity of the virus, and the related impact on consumer travel and
demand for delivery services. This uncertainty could increase the likelihood that our business fails. 

Market
Opportunity 

According
to Statista (2020), the global ride hailing and taxi market is projected to reach almost 260 billion in 2021 with 1.47 billion registered
users, with an expected annual growth of 18.8 from 2020 to 2025, resulting in a projected market value of about 386 billion by 2025.
User penetration is 19.3 in 2020 and is expected to hit 20.8 by 2025. 

A
number of factors contribute to driving the growth of the ride-hailing market: 

Increasing
Smartphone and Internet Penetration : As ride sharing is an internet-enabled service, internet connectivity is the basic requirement
for availing ride sharing services in any part of the world. The users are required to download an application on their smartphone and
use data services to access the app and other navigation and information services related to it. Internet connectivity is also needed
for navigation, telematics, and vehicle-to-vehicle communication. According to the International Telecommunication Union, approximately
81 of the population in developed countries uses the internet. On the other hand, 40 of individuals in developing countries have access
to the internet through that rate is increasing rapidly. 

On-demand
transportation services : On-demand transportation services are characterized by flexible routing and ad-hoc scheduling of private
vehicles offering personal transport experiences to the general public by picking up or dropping off passengers or goods at locations
of the customer s choice. On-demand ride-hailing services ensure that customers can accurately locate the vehicles, track their
journey, and offer safety to the occupants. The proliferation of such services across countries is expected to significantly drive market
growth. 

Increase
in Cost of Vehicle Ownership : The cost of owning a personal vehicle has increased with rising fuel prices over time and an increase
in finance, insurance, and vehicle registration costs. Maintenance costs, which include the repair of parts and accessories and labor
charges, have also increased and added to the overall cost of vehicle ownership. Also, with the introduction of strict emission norms,
vehicles need better, advanced, and costly after treatment devices. These factors have increased the cost of vehicle ownership, which
in turn has increased the popularity of ride sharing services. 

2 

Lower
rate of car ownership among millennials : Due to vehicle ownership costs and personal preferences, the rate of vehicle ownership among
millennials and subsequent generations reaching the legal driving age is low compared to older generations. The millennials are choosing
practical, smartphone accessible transport options that are simple, flexible, and comparatively inexpensive. Thus, it is anticipated
that successive generations that reach the legal driving age will opt for ride hailing options given their assessment of costs and their
relative familiarity with using smartphone-based applications. 

We
plan to commence our ride-hailing operations in the United States. Due to a large number of market vendors based in the U.S., the country
hosts most of the major innovators and investors in the sector. The United States is one of the early adopters of the business model,
which provides consumer familiarity with the services we intend to offer. North America accounted for a global ride-hailing market share
of more than 35 in terms of revenue in 2018. This is attributed to the fact that most ride-hailing companies operating in the industry
were incorporated in U.S. High demand for public transportation in cities like New York, Chicago, San Francisco, and Seattle, is contributing
to market growth. 

The
overall size of the ride hailing and ride sharing market in North America is growing with 36 of U.S. adults using the service in 2018
compared to 15 in 2015. According to Accenture, nearly two-thirds (63 of the US car owners who use ride-hailing services say that
they would consider giving up their vehicles over the next decade in favor of ride-hailing. Based on a survey of more than 1,000 US consumers,
Accenture found that consumer satisfaction with ride-hailing companies is very high, at 92 , and that the vast majority (93 of the
respondents expect to maintain or increase their spending on ride-hailing services. Ride-hailing usage has increased across most demographic
groups, but adoption figures continue to vary by age, educational attainment, and income level. For example, roughly half of Americans
ages 18 to 29 (51 say they have used a ride-hailing service, compared with 24 of those ages 50 and older. Those whose annual household
income is 75,000 or more are roughly twice as likely as those earning less than 30,000 to have used these services. Subject to the
successful launch of our WarpSpeedTaxi app in the United States, we intend to expand our operations to other markets, including Europe,
Canada, and Australia. 

Emerging
Growth Company Status 

Because
we generated less than 1 billion in total annual gross revenues during our most recently completed fiscal year, we qualify as an emerging
growth company under the Jumpstart Our Business Startups JOBS Act. 

We
will lose our emerging growth company status on the earliest occurrence of any of the following events: 

1. on
the last day of any fiscal year in which we earn at least 1 billion in total annual gross revenues, which amount is adjusted for
inflation every five years; 

2.
on the last day of the fiscal year of the issuer following the fifth anniversary of the date of our first sale of common equity
securities pursuant to an effective registration statement; 

3.
on the date on which we have, during the previous 3-year period, issued more than 1 billion in non-convertible debt; or 

4.
the date on which such issuer is deemed to be a large accelerated filer , as defined in section 240.12b 2 of
title 17, Code of Federal Regulations, or any successor thereto. 

3 

A
 large accelerated filer is an issuer that, at the end of its fiscal year, meets the following conditions: 

1.
it has an aggregate worldwide market value of the voting and non-voting common equity held by its non-affiliates of 700 million or
more as of the last business day of the issuer s most recently completed second fiscal quarter; 

2.
It has been subject to the requirements of section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Act for a period of at least twelve calendar months;
and 

3.
It has filed at least one annual report pursuant to section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Act. 

As
an emerging growth company, exemptions from the following provisions are available to us: 

1.
Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, which requires auditor attestation of internal controls; 

2.
Section 14A(a) and (b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which require companies to hold shareholder advisory votes on
executive compensation and golden parachute compensation; 

3.
Section 14(i) of the Exchange Act (which has not yet been implemented), which requires companies to disclose the relationship
between executive compensation actually paid and the financial performance of the company; 

4.
Section 953(b)(1) of the Dodd-Frank Act (which has not yet been implemented), which requires companies to disclose the ratio between
the annual total compensation of the CEO and the median of the annual total compensation of all employees of the companies;
and 

5.
The requirement to provide certain other executive compensation disclosure under Item 402 of Regulation S-K. Instead, an emerging
growth company must only comply with the more limited provisions of Item 402 applicable to smaller reporting companies, regardless
of the issuer s size. 

Pursuant
to Section 107 of the JOBS Act, an emerging growth company may choose to forgo such exemption and instead comply with the requirements
that apply to an issuer that is not an emerging growth company. We have elected under this section of the JOBS Act to maintain our status
as an emerging growth company and take advantage of the JOBS Act provisions relating to complying with new or revised accounting standards
under Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act. 

Competition 

There
is intense competition between traditional taxi companies and ride-hailing services. Companies providing ride-hailing services are transitioning
from providing traditional taxi services to additional services, such as ride sharing and food and consumer goods delivery, in order
to expand the overall market for transportation services. 

The
ride-hailing market is quite fragmented as there is high competition in the market among major players. Since this market is expanding,
new entrants are emerging as well. We will compete with other ride-hailing companies, including Uber, Lyft, Door Dash, and Grubhub that
are well-established in North America. In other markets where we may wish to expand, there are also well-established regional companies,
such as DiDi (China), Ola (India), Grab (southeast Asia), Bolt (Europe, Africa, and the Middle East), and Cabify (South America). These
companies generally have greater financial and technical resources, industry expertise, and managerial capabilities than we do. Most
of our competitors benefit from established brand awareness with current and prospective customers. 

We
believe that industry competition for customers is primarily based on brand recognition, marketing, price, and quality of service. We
hope to be able to compete effectively based on these factors though we primarily hope to develop a niche market by providing lower commission
charges to restaurants that agree to utilize our food delivery services and by developing underexplored markets, such as businesses that
use local courier services for non-food deliveries and rely on traditional vehicle courier companies. 

Compliance
with Government Regulations 

We
will be subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations in the United States and other jurisdictions. These laws, regulations, and
standards govern issues such as worker classification, labor and employment, anti-discrimination, payments, worker confidentiality obligations,
product liability, environmental protection, personal injury, text messaging, subscription services, intellectual property, consumer
protection and warnings, marketing, taxation, privacy, data security, competition, unionizing and collective action, arbitration agreements
and class action waiver provisions, terms of service, mobile application and website accessibility, money transmittal, and background
checks. The sale and delivery of goods through our platform is also subject to laws, regulations, and standards that govern food safety,
alcohol, tobacco, pharmaceuticals and controlled substances, hazardous substances, and the interstate and intrastate transport of goods.
These regulations are often complex and subject to varying interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity, and as a
result, their application in practice may change or develop over time through judicial decisions or as new guidance or interpretations
are provided by regulatory and governing bodies, such as federal, state, and local administrative agencies. 

4 

Other
proposed changes to laws and regulations related to our industry include a proposed rule under consideration by the New York State Liquor
Authority that would limit fees that can be charged by food delivery facilitation services and proposed legislation in California and
other states that would require third-party grocery services to maintain minimum liability insurance. 

We
will also be subject to general business regulations and laws as well as federal and state regulations and laws specifically governing
the Internet and e-commerce. Existing and future laws and regulations may impede the growth of the Internet, e-commerce or other online
services, and increase the cost of providing online services. These regulations and laws may cover taxation, tariffs, user privacy, data
protection, pricing, content, copyrights, distribution, electronic contracts and other communications, consumer protection, broadband
residential Internet access and the characteristics and quality of services. It is not clear how existing laws governing issues such
as property ownership, sales, use and other taxes, libel and personal privacy apply to the Internet and e-commerce. Unfavorable resolution
of these issues may harm our business and results of operations. 

We
anticipate that a significant amount of our operations will be conducted in India due to relative low labor costs. There are no governmental
regulations specifically relating to services that we intend to provide within India. Foreign corporations, such as us, are authorized
to conduct business in India; however, they are required to comply with domestic business laws and regulations, including those relating
to occupational health and safety, and minimum wage requirements. We do not anticipate that these regulations will have a significant
adverse impact on our operations or cause us to incur significant expenses related to compliance.

7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of our Financial Conditions and Results of Operations. 

Introduction 

We
were incorporated on November 18, 2020 under the laws of the State of Wyoming. 

Results
of Operations for Fiscal 2021 

From
our incorporation on November 18, 2020 to our fiscal year end of July 31, 2021, we did not earn any revenue. During the fiscal year ended
July 31, 2021, we incurred net loss of 20,165 consisting entirely of general and administrative fees. 

We
have not attained profitable operations and are dependent upon obtaining financing to complete our proposed business plan. For these
reasons our auditors believe that there is substantial doubt that we will be able to continue as a going concern. 

Our
financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern and, accordingly, do not include adjustments
relating to the recoverability and realization of assets and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable
to continue in operation. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

As
of July 31, 2021, our current assets consisted of 17,194 in cash and 35,000 in prepayments and deposits and our total liabilities were
 331,593, which consisted of accounts payable of 81,593 and accrued liabilities and a note payable of 250,000 to the vendor of the
WarpSpeed Taxi computer application. We expect we will require additional capital to meet our long term operating requirements. We expect
to raise additional capital through, among other methods, the sale of equity or debt securities. 

Cash
Flows from Operating Activities 

We
have not generated positive cash flows from operating activities. For the fiscal year ended July 31, 2021, net cash used in operating
activities was 276,428 consisting of our net loss for the period and prepayments and deposits at period end, adjusted for accounts payable
of 81,593 and a note payable of 250,000. 

Cash
Flows from Investing Activities 

For
the fiscal year ended July 31, 2021, we used 304,134 in investment activities consisting of a 300,000 investment in software and software
development costs of 4,134 related to the acquisition and further development of the WarpSpeed Taxi computer application. 

6 

Cash
Flows from Financing Activities 

We
have financed our operations exclusively through the sale of our common stock. For the fiscal year ended July 31, 2021, cash provided
from financing activities was 44,900. 

We
have not attained profitable operations and are dependent upon obtaining financing to pursue exploration activities. For these reasons,
there is substantial doubt that we will be able to continue as a going concern 

Since
our incorporation, we have financed our operations through proceeds from the sale of our common stock. We expect to finance operations
through the sale of equity for the foreseeable future, as we do not receive significant revenue from our business operations. There is
no guarantee that we will be successful in arranging financing on acceptable terms. 

Our
ability to raise additional capital is affected by trends and uncertainties beyond our control. We do not currently have any arrangements
for financing and we may not be able to find such financing if required. Obtaining additional financing would be subject to a number
of factors, including investor sentiment. Market factors may make the timing, amount, terms or conditions of additional financing unavailable
to us. 

Our
auditors are of the opinion that our continuation as a going concern is in doubt. Our continuation as a going concern is dependent upon
continued financial support from our shareholders and other related parties. 

Critical
Accounting Policies 

Our
discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements, which have been
prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements 

As
of the date of this annual report, we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current
or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity,
capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors. 

7 

Use
of Estimates 

The
preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires
us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to revenue
recognition, inventories, adequacy of allowances for doubtful accounts, valuation of long-lived assets and goodwill, income taxes, litigation
and warranties. We base its estimates on historical and anticipated results and trends and on various other assumptions that we believe
are reasonable under the circumstances, including assumptions as to future events. The policies discussed below are considered by management
to be critical to an understanding of our financial statements. These estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying
values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. By their nature, estimates are subject to an inherent
degree of uncertainty. Actual results may differ from those estimates. 

Property
and Equipment 

Property
and equipment are recorded at cost. Depreciation of property and equipment are accounted for by accelerated methods over the following
estimated useful lives: 

Evaluation
of Long-Lived Assets 

We
review property and equipment for potential impairment whenever significant events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying
value may not be recoverable in accordance with the guidance in ASC 360-15-35 Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets .
An impairment exists when the carrying amount of the long-lived assets is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value. The carrying amount
of a long-lived asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual
disposition of the asset. If an impairment exists, the resulting write-down would be the difference between the fair market value of
the long-lived asset and the related net book value. 

Income
Taxes 

Deferred
income tax assets or liabilities are computed based on the temporary differences between the financial statement and income tax bases
of assets and liabilities using the statutory marginal income tax rate in effect for the years in which the differences are expected
to reverse. Deferred income tax expenses or credits are based on the changes in the deferred income tax assets or liabilities from period
to period. A valuation allowance against deferred tax assets is required if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely
than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The valuation allowance should be sufficient to reduce
the deferred tax asset to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized.

To the shareholders and the board of directors of Warpspeed Taxi Inc.. 

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm. 

Opinion on the financial statements. 

I have audited the accompanying balance sheet of Warpspeed Taxi Inc and
the related statements of income, stockholders equity and cash flow for the period November 18, 2020 - July 31, 2021. In my opinion based
on my audit the financial statements present fairly in all material respects the financial position of the company as of July 31, 2021
and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended in conformity with principles generally accepted in the United
States of America. 

These financial statements are the responsibility of the company s
management. My responsibility is to express an opinion on the financial statements based on my audit. I am a public accounting firm registered
with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the company
in accordance with the US federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and
the PCAOB. 

I conducted my audit in accordance with the standards
of the PCAOB. Those standards require that I plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures
included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. My audit also included
evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation
of the financial statements. I believe my audit provides a reasonable basis for my opinion.

 as of July 31, 2021 and further losses are anticipated in the development of its business raising substantial
doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. In order to remain in business, the Company will need to
raise capital in the next twelve months. The ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the Company generating profitable
operations in the future and/or obtaining the necessary financing to meet its obligations and repay its liabilities arising from normal
business operations when they come due. Management intends to finance operating costs over the next twelve months with existing cash
on hand and proceeds from its public offering. The Company has no written or verbal commitments from stockholders, director or officer
to provide the Company with any form of cash advances, loans or other sources of liquidity to meet its working capital needs. The
accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification
of assets or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that may result from the possible inability of the Company to continue as
a going concern.

The
Company has adopted FASB ASC 825, Financial Instruments, which allows companies to choose to measure eligible financial instruments and
certain other items at fair value that are not required to be measured at fair value. The Company has not elected the fair value option
for any eligible financial instruments. 

In
May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers ASU 2014-09 ), which requires an entity
to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers. ASU
2014-09 will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. generally accepted accounting principles when it becomes effective.
In July 2015, the FASB deferred the effective date of the standard by an additional year; however, it provided companies the option to
adopt one year earlier, commensurate with the original effective date. The amendment is effective for public entities for fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 2016. The Company is currently evaluating this standard and has not yet selected a transition method or
the effective date on which it plans to adopt the standard, nor has it determined the effect of the standard on its financial statements
and related disclosures.

that may be available to reduce future years taxable income in varying amounts through
2040. Future tax benefits which may arise as a result of these losses have not been recognized in these financial statements, as their
realization is determined not likely to occur and accordingly the Company has recorded a valuation allowance for the deferred tax asset
relating to these tax loss carry-forwards. 

The
ultimate realization of deferred income tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which
those temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred income tax liabilities, projected
future taxable income, and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. Based on consideration of these items, management
has determined that enough uncertainty exists relative to the realization of the deferred income tax asset balances to warrant the application
of a full valuation allowance as of July 31, 2021. All tax years since inception remains open for examination by taxing authorities.

Item
9A. Controls and Procedures. 

As
supervised by our board of directors and our principal executive and principal financial officer, management has established a system
of disclosure, controls and procedures and has evaluated the effectiveness of that system. The system and its evaluation are reported
on in the below Management s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our principal executive and financial
officer has concluded that our disclosure, controls and procedures (as defined in Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e)) as of July 31, 2021, were not effective, based on the evaluation of these controls and procedures required by paragraph
(b) of Rule 13a-15. 

Management s
Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

Management
is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f)
of the Exchange Act. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability
of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles. 

Management
assessed the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of July 31, 2021. We carried out this assessment using the
criteria of the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control Integrated Framework. 

B.
Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

Management
is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over our financial reporting. In order to evaluate the effectiveness
of internal control over financial reporting, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, management has conducted an assessment,
including testing, using the criteria in the Internal Control - Integrated Framework, issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations
of the Treadway Commission COSO ). 

Our
system of internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. 

Based
on our evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our internal controls over financial reporting
were not effective as of July 31, 2021 and were subject to material weaknesses. 

A
material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is
a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented
or detected on a timely basis. We have identified the following material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting
using the criteria established in the COSO: 

1. Failing
 to have an audit committee or other independent committee that is independent of management
 to assess internal control over financial reporting; and 

2. Failing
 to have a director that qualifies as an audit committee financial expert as defined in Item
 407(d)(5)(ii) of Regulation S-K. 

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. In addition, projections
of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in
conditions and that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

This
annual report does not include an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial
reporting. Management s report was not subject to attestation by our registered public accounting firm, pursuant to rules of the
Securities and Exchange Commission that permit us to provide only management s report in this annual report. Management concluded
in this assessment that as of July 31, 2021, our internal control over financial reporting is not effective. 

There
have been no significant changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d15(f) under the
Exchange Act) during the fourth quarter of our 2019 fiscal year that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially
affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

percent (5 of the Company s equity securities, to file reports of ownership and changes in ownership with the Securities and
Exchange Commission. Officers, directors and greater than ten percent shareholders are required by SEC regulation to furnish the Company
