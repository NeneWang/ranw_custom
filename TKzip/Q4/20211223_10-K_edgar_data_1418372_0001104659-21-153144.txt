Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements 

The
following report contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and
Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Forward-looking statements are statements that predict or describe future
events or trends and that do not relate solely to historical matters. All of our projections in this annual report are forward-looking
statements. You can generally identify forward-looking statements as statements containing the words appears, believe, 
 expect, hope, may, will, anticipate, intend, estimate, 
 project, assume or other similar expressions. Certain factors that might cause such a difference include the
following: changes in general economic conditions; including changes that may influence group conference and guests vacation plans;
changes in travel patterns; changes in consumer tastes in destinations or accommodations for group conferences and vacations; changes
in Rental Pool participation by the current condominium owners; our ability to continue to operate the Innisbrook Resort and Golf Club,
or the Resort under our management contracts; and the resale of condominiums to owners who elect neither to participate
in the Rental Pool nor to become members of the Resort. You should not place undue reliance on our forward-looking statements because
the matters they describe are subject to known (and unknown) risks, uncertainties and other unpredictable factors, many of which are beyond
our control. Our forward-looking statements are based on the limited information currently available to us and speak only as of the date
on which this report was filed with the Securities Exchange Commission. Our continued internet posting or subsequent distribution of this
dated report does not imply continued affirmation of the forward-looking statements included in it. We undertake no obligation, and we
expressly disclaim any obligation, to issue any updates to our forward-looking statements, even if subsequent events cause our expectations
to change regarding the matters discussed in those statements. Future events are inherently uncertain. Moreover, it is particularly difficult
to predict business activity levels at the Resort with any certainty. Accordingly, our projections in this annual report are subject to
particularly high uncertainty. 

Our
projections should not be regarded as legal promises, representations or warranties of any kind whatsoever. Over time, our actual results,
performance or achievements will likely differ from the anticipated results, performance or achievements that are expressed or implied
by our forward-looking statements, and such differences might be significant and harmful to your interests.

PART I 

ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

Background 

Salamander
Innisbrook, LLC (the Company was organized on June 14, 2007 by Salamander Farms, LLC under the laws of the state of Florida
for the purpose of owning and operating Innisbrook Resort and Golf Club (the Resort ). The Company, and its wholly owned
subsidiaries, Salamander Innisbrook Securities, LLC and Salamander Innisbrook Condominium, LLC, are hereinafter referred to as we ,
 us , our . On July 16, 2007, we purchased the Resort, three condominiums, which became Salamander Innisbrook
Condominiums, LLC, and all of the equity interests in Golf Host Securities, Inc. from Golf Trust of America, Inc. and its subsidiaries
and affiliates. The Resort is a full service 72-hole destination golf and conference facility located near Tampa, Florida. The Resort
features 1,216 condominium rooms, all of which are owned by third parties or affiliates. Approximately 290 condominium owners (representing
302 hotel rooms) participate in a rental pool (the Rental Pool we operate. 

Rental Pool Condominiums 

Condominium
ownership is a realty subdivision in which the individual lots are deemed apartment units. Instead of owning a plot of ground,
the condominium owners own the space where their condominium units are located. This leaves substantial properties in interest which are
not individually owned, such as the underlying land, driveways, parking lots, building foundations, exterior walls and roofs, garden areas
and utility lines. These areas are termed common property or common elements. Each condominium owner has an undivided fractional interest
in the common property. 

The condominium
owners at the Resort have established an Association of Condominium Owners (the Association ), to administer and maintain
this common property and to conduct the business of the condominium owners. In particular, the Association is responsible for maintaining
insurance on the real property, upkeep of the structures, maintenance of the grounds, electricity for the common areas, water/sewer and
security services. The Association assesses fees to defray these expenses and to establish necessary reserves. An assessment, if not timely
paid, may result in a lien being placed upon the unit of a delinquent condominium owner. Each condominium owner must pay ad valorem property
taxes, contents insurance, interior maintenance and other matters independent of the other unit owners. These expenses are incurred by
each owner of condominium units whether or not the unit participates in the Rental Pool at the Resort. With respect to governing the affairs
of the Association, the participating condominium owners are accorded one vote per condominium unit owned. State statutes also impact
the way in which the Association s affairs are administered. 

Markets and Marketing 

The
Resort is located in Palm Harbor, Florida and is a destination golf resort that appeals to group convention business and leisure travelers
within all market segments. The Resort caters to corporate meeting planners and sports enthusiasts within a variety of industries, the
majority of which are located in central and eastern United States. The Resort markets through most of the typical channels utilizing
e-commerce, print media, third party representation firms, travel agents and wholesalers. 

The
Resort provides condominium accommodations, four dining locations, room service, over 65,000 square feet of banquet and catering space,
72 holes of golf, golf instruction, a full-service spa and fitness center, tennis center and recreational entertainment to members, business
meeting attendees, group meeting guests, leisure guests and their families. The Resort offers room-only rates, golf packages, and family
vacation packages. Larger golf or conference groups typically involve contractual agreements. Accordingly, we do not believe that the
loss of a single conference or even a few conferences of average size would have a significant adverse impact on our business taken as
a whole. 

The
Resort s accommodations are condominium units that are owned by third parties or us. These units are sold by registered securities
brokers, including Golf Host Securities, Inc., which is one of our subsidiaries. 

Seasonality 

The
Florida resort industry is seasonal in nature and historically the Resort s business levels are stronger in the winter and
spring months as guests come from the northeast and other colder regions to enjoy the warm weather. In contrast, there is a decline
in business levels during the summer months as the hot summer weather makes Florida less appealing for group golf outings and vacation
destination golfers. The Resort uses seasonal pricing (peak, shoulder and off-peak) to maximize revenues. The Resort may also
experience reduced bookings as a result of hurricane-related concerns.

PGA TOUR Event 

In March 2020,
approximately one week from the beginning of the 2020 PGA Valspar Tournament, Copperhead Charities and the PGA Tour notified us that the
tournament would be cancelled for 2020 due to the impacts of the novel coronavirus COVID-19 pandemic. No cancellation
fees were paid by Copperhead Charities but we were reimbursed for our out-of-pocket expenses. In April 2021, an agreement was signed to
continue the Tournament through 2025. 

Intellectual
Property 

The
Resort has registered service marks and domain names that are necessary for the Resort to effectively conduct business. Service marks
include Innisbrook #955489, registered March 13, 1973, and the Innisbrook shield logo #955488 registered March 13, 1973.
The operations of the Resort are not considered to be dependent upon the availability of raw materials, nor any adverse effects that may
result from the duration of patents, licenses, franchises or concessions. 

Competition 

Conveniently
located near the Florida Gulf Coast and Tampa International Airport, the Resort is located within 900 acres of a dramatically landscaped
setting. The Resort competes using a unique price/value strategy through its offering of spacious accommodations, high levels of customer
service, award-winning golf, and one of the largest conference facilities in the southeastern United States. The Resort s major
competitors are other similar golf and conference-oriented resorts in the southeastern United States. 

Research
and Development 

We have no research
and development expenses. 

Environmental
Matters 

Operation
of the golf courses at the Resort involves the use and storage of various hazardous materials such as herbicides, pesticides, fertilizers,
motor oils and gasoline. Under various federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations, an owner or operator of real property
may become liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous substances released on or in its property. These laws often
impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the release of hazardous substances.
As of December 31, 2020, we are not aware of any violations of these laws, ordinances and regulations. 

Government
Regulation 

The
Resort is subject to the Americans with Disabilities Act ADA of 1990. The ADA has separate compliance requirements for
 public accommodations and commercial facilities , but generally requires public facilities such as clubhouses
and recreation areas to be accessible to people with disabilities. Noncompliance could result in imposition of fines or an award of damages
to private litigants. We are responsible for compliance costs incurred at the Resort. The condominiums in the Rental Pool are residential
properties and are not subject to ADA. 

Employees 

At
December 31, 2019, we had 518 employees; 322 full-time and 196 part-time. At December 31, 2020, we had 335 employees; 217 full-time and
118 part-time. We also periodically engage casual laborers as needed.

ITEM 1B.
UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS 

None. 

ITEM 2. PROPERTIES 

The
Resort is situated on approximately 900 acres of land located in the northern portion of Pinellas County, Florida, near the Gulf of Mexico.
It is approximately 9 miles north of Clearwater and approximately 20 miles west of Tampa. There are 938 condominium units, 36 of which
are strictly residential, with the balance eligible for Rental Pool participation. Of the 902 remaining eligible units, 248, on average,
participate in the Rental Pool on a year-to-year basis. See additional discussion in Item 1 under the caption Rental Pool Condominiums. 
These condominium units are leased by us from the condominium owners and used as hotel accommodations for the Resort. We also own three
condominium units, all of which participate in the Rental Pool in the same fashion as all other Rental Pool participants. Approximately
20 of the units have lockout master bedroom units, which allow the rental of the condominium unit as two hotel rooms. As a result of
the potential use of lockout master bedroom units, the total number of rooms at the resort is 1,217 and the average of 248 units participating
in the Rental Pool at any one time is equivalent to approximately 302 hotel rooms. The Resort complex includes 72 holes of golf, practice
ranges, three clubhouses with retail, golf, and food and beverage outlets, three conference and exhibit buildings, a full-service spa
and fitness center, six swimming pools including a themed water attraction, a recreation facility, a tennis facility and numerous administrative
and support structures. These amenities are owned by the Company and have undergone substantial renovation and improvements since we purchased
the Resort in 2007. 

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 

We are currently involved in certain litigation arising from a full-service
construction contract we entered (as agent for and on behalf of the Rental Pool participants) with AMH Construction, Inc. AMH in the amount of 3,420,670. The renovation was performed as a Turn-Key project with each Participating Owner paying their
respective share of the total costs. We, and the Lessors' Advisory Committee of the Rental Pool LAC ), jointly supervised
the renovation. On January 23, 2019, we terminated the contract with AMH for breach of contract, including AMH's failure to complete the
renovation work in accordance with the contract schedule. On April 18, 2019, we served a demand letter to AMH asserting damages of 4,423,070
for the additional costs incurred by the Participating Owners and return of deposits made for work that was not performed. On August 30,
2019, we filed a lawsuit in Pinellas County, Florida against AMH seeking damages for breach of contract in the amount of 4,423,070 plus
attorney fees and other costs of approximately 364,400 in 2019. On October 31, 2019, AMH filed a response to our suit including a counterclaim
in the amount of 890,751, a claim that we deny. AMH alleges in its counterclaim that it was not compensated for work performed. In March
2020, Pinellas County suspended all hearings until further notice due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Due to the early stages of litigation,
possible outcomes and impacts to our consolidated financial statements are not yet reasonably determinable; accordingly, our consolidated
financial statements do not give effect to any gain or loss that may result from the resolution of these matters. 

ITEM 4. MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES

PART II 

ITEM 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANT S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER
MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES 

We are a single-member limited liability company and do not have any
stock. Our membership interests are not publicly traded. 

There are 902 deeded condominium units allowing Rental Pool participation
by their owners, of which three are owned by us. 

The condominium units that are leased to us for Rental Pool participation,
are deemed to be securities. These units are hereinafter referred to as Rental Pool Securities. These securities are deemed securities
pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, but there is no market for such securities other than sales through the normal real
estate market. 

Because the Rental Pool Securities are real estate related, no dividends
have been paid or will be paid to their owners. However, the Rental Pool lease agreements provide that the Rental Pool participants are
entitled to a contractual distribution paid quarterly in exchange for our right to use their condominium units in the Rental Pool. 

ITEM 6. SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA 

Not required for Smaller Reporting Company. 

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL
CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 

The
following accounting policies are considered critical to the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. These and other accounting
policies require that estimates be made based on assumptions and judgment, which can affect the reporting of revenues, expenses, assets,
liabilities and disclosure of contingencies in our consolidated financial statements. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical
experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. However, actual results may differ from
changes in these estimates and assumptions. 

Revenue Recognition 

Revenues are derived from a variety of sources including, but not limited
to, hotel, food and beverage operations, retail sales and golf course operations. With the exception of initiation fees and membership
dues, all revenues net of any sales and other taxes collected are recognized as products are delivered or services are performed. Revenues
from performance obligations satisfied over time include membership dues, annual fees and initiation fees. The membership initiation fees
at the Resort are nonrefundable and are initially recorded when received as deferred revenue and amortized over the estimated average
life of a membership which, based on historical information, is deemed to be ten years for full golf members and five years for resort
and executive memberships. Membership dues and annual fees are recognized over the applicable membership period (three months to one year
depending on type of membership). 

Intangible Assets 

We evaluate our
indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment annually or at an interim date if a significant event occurs or circumstances indicate
that the assets may not be recoverable. Factors we consider important, and which could indicate impairment, include the following: (i)
significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results; (ii) significant changes in the manner of our
use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business; and (iii) significant negative industry or economic trends. 

Our intangible
assets consist of: (i) a water contract; and (ii) our trademark and trade name. The valuation of the water contract is based on the projected
annual savings associated with having this contract. The valuation of the trademark and trade name is derived from the residual revenue
streams from Resort revenues that is attributed to the Innisbrook trade name. We attribute an indefinite life to both of these intangibles. 

7 

During
the years of 2020 and 2019, we evaluated our intangible assets, and determined that the carrying balances of such assets were recoverable. 

Impairment of Other Long-Lived Assets 

We review our other long-lived assets for impairment if a significant
event occurs or circumstances arise that indicate the assets may not be recoverable by comparing the carrying values of the assets with
their estimated future undiscounted cash flows. In reviewing impairment of our long-lived assets, we review the recent operating and pricing
trends with the financial performance of the Resort in the aggregate for material variances from our expectations of the Resort s
revenues. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, we believe the carrying values of our other long-lived assets are recoverable. 

Loss Contingencies 

We estimate loss contingencies in accordance with FASB ASC 450-20 Loss
Contingencies, which states that a loss contingency shall be accrued by a charge to operations if both of the following conditions are
met: (a) information available before the consolidated financial statements are issued or are available to be issued indicates that it
is probable that a liability had been incurred at the date of the consolidated financial statements and (b) the amount of loss can be
reasonably estimated.

During 2020 overall resort revenues decreased by 15,873,424 or 41.5 
compared with the prior year. The decrease in revenues was primarily driven by the COVID-19 pandemic, including the temporary closure
of the Resort from March 24, 2020 to May 21, 2020. The decrease in room revenues of 49.6 resulted in decreased food and beverage revenues,
included in other resort revenues, of approximately 39.6 compared with the prior year. Total costs and expenses declined year-over-year
by 13,370,526 or 34.3 which is attributable to the decrease in revenues across the same period. 

In spite of this pandemic, our revenues and
results of operations have improved considerably in 2021 and we believe that this trend will continue throughout 2021 and beyond. However,
it is difficult to estimate the length or severity of this outbreak and if the pandemic continues, it could have an adverse impact on
our consolidated results of operations and financial position. 

Legal Entity Structure 

Salamander Innisbrook, LLC is a single-member limited liability company
with Salamander Farms, LLC as the sole member. 

8 

Income Tax Status 

With
the exception of an entity owned by Salamander Innisbrook Securities, LLC for which income taxes have been minimal the Company and its
subsidiaries are single-member limited liability companies and therefore the results of our operations flow through to our member for
inclusion in its income tax returns. Accordingly, no provision or liability for federal or state income taxes has been included in our
consolidated financial statements presented in this report. 

We
have adopted the provisions of FASB ASC 740-10, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes . Under this topic, we are required to
evaluate each of our tax positions to determine if they are more likely than not to be sustained if the taxing authority examines the
respective position. A tax position includes an entity s tax status, as a pass-through entity, and the decision not to file a tax
return. We have evaluated each of our tax positions and have determined that no provision or liability for income taxes is necessary. 

We evaluate
the validity of our conclusions regarding uncertain income tax positions on an annual basis to determine if facts or circumstances have
arisen that might cause us to change our judgment regarding the likelihood of a tax position s sustainability under examination.
Our member files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and the State of Virginia. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Cash used in operating
activities approximated 3,355,000 in 2020 compared to cash generated by such activities of approximately 1,910,000 in 2019, an overall
decline of approximately 5,265,000. The significant change resulted primarily from an increase in our net loss of approximately 2,268,000,
coupled with reductions in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of approximately 2,044,000. 

We used cash of
approximately 1,202,000 and 2,478,000 for investing activities in 2020 and 2019, respectively. The decline of approximately 1,276,000
resulted primarily because we incurred deferred contract costs of approximately 1,843,000 in 2019 as compared to 883,000 of such costs
incurred in 2020. These costs arose from the payment of cost overruns arising from renovation of condominiums used in the Rental Pool.

We generated cash
from financing activities of approximately 4,817,000 and 154,000 in 2020 and 2019, respectively. The increase of approximately 4,646,000
resulted primarily from proceeds of approximately 3,394,000 we received under a Paycheck Protection Program loan. This Paycheck Protection
Program loan was forgiven by the Small Business Association on June 28, 2021. In addition, we paid approximately 533,000 under certain
finance lease obligations that did not recur in 2020 and our actual cash repayments under our other note payable were approximately 580,000
less in 2020 because our lender allowed us to offset scheduled payments under such note with restricted cash of 500,000 held in escrow. 

Our results of operations have improved considerably in 2021 as various
restrictions resulting from the COVID 19 pandemic have been relaxed. However, the COVID 19 pandemic remains a rapidly evolving situation.
The extent of the impact of COVID 19 on our business and financial results will depend on future developments, including the duration
and spread of the outbreak within the markets in which we operate, government actions and programs, and the related impact on consumer
confidence and spending, all of which are highly uncertain. 

Irrespective of the above, we believe that our cash on hand and additional
cash generated from operations will be adequate to meet our obligations (both capital and operating) for the next twelve months, and that
if any short-term cash needs are necessary that our member will continue to provide capital to fund some needs. 

At December 31, 2020, we are obligated under a note payable that requires
balloon and other payments of approximately 11,900,000 through April 2022. We do not currently have the cash to pay the balloon payment
on such indebtedness due in April 2022 but believe we will be able to refinance it prior to its maturity. In addition, we have violated
certain covenants included in the loan agreement however the lender has waived their rights with respect to such acceleration and we believe
they will continue to provide forbearance with such violations. 

Environmental Matters 

None. 

Off Balance Sheet Arrangements 

We do not have any unconsolidated subsidiaries. 

We do not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or
unconsolidated financial partnerships of the type often referenced as structured finance or special purpose entities, i.e.,
unconsolidated entities established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or
limited purposes. Further, we have not guaranteed any obligations of unconsolidated entities nor do we have any commitment or intent
to provide additional funding to any such entities. Accordingly, we believe we are not materially exposed to any market, credit,
liquidity or financing risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships.

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 

Market risks arise from changes in interest rates, foreign currency
exchange rates and other market changes that affect market sensitive instruments. The carrying value of variable rate debt financing reflected
in our consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2020 and 2019, approximates fair value as the changes in their associated interest
rates reflect the current market and credit risk is similar to when the loans were originally obtained. 

We are obligated under a note payable with interest of the One Month
LIBOR rate plus two and a quarter percent (2.25 per annum adjusted monthly on the first day of each LIBOR interest period. The loan
is collateralized by our real and personal property and guarantees of certain affiliates. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, this notes

ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 15d
-15 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required
to be reported in our SEC filings is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the periods specified in the rules and forms
of the SEC and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, under the direction
of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure
controls and procedures. Based on such evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, at December
31, 2020 and 2019, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective because of the material weaknesses in our internal control
over financial reporting as discussed below. 

Notwithstanding such material weaknesses, which are described below
in Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, we have concluded that the consolidated financial statements
included in this Form 10-K present fairly, in all material respects, our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash
flows for the periods presented in conformity with GAAP. 

Management s Report on Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting 

We are responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal
control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act. Our internal control
system was designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated
financial statements for external purposes, in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Because of inherent limitations,
a system of internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate due to change in conditions, or that the degree
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

Under the supervision and with the participation of our management,
including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal controls
over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, based on the framework stated by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations
of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013). Based on the assessment, management concluded that, as of
December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company s internal control over financial reporting was not effective as a result of the material
weaknesses described below. 

We restated the opening balance of our Member s equity as of
January 1, 2019. This restatement resulted because our disclosure controls were not adequate to recognize that the results of operations
and financial position of certain entities previously reflected as affiliates should have been included in our consolidated financial
statements. 

This annual report does not include an attestation report of our registered
certified public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. 

11 

Remediation Efforts to Address Material Weaknesses 

We are committed to maintaining a strong internal control environment.
In response to the identified material weaknesses, management, with the oversight of the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, has
taken actions toward the remediation of the respective material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting as outlined below. 

In 2019 and 2020, we terminated the employment of those
individuals who lacked the appropriate level of knowledge and experience with generally accepted accounting principles, and hired a
new Director of Finance. Additionally, we hired an outside consultant who is trained and experienced in internal controls, reporting
and accounting for SEC reporting companies in our industry. And finally, the oversight of internal controls and financial reporting
has been transitioned to our parent s corporate accounting department. 

We will continue to make improvements to our internal controls and
monitoring procedures as necessary to ensure consistent application of generally accepted accounting principles and to allow for more
effective monitoring of compliance. We believe the steps taken above will remediate the material weakness described above as of the date
of this report.

AND RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS 

We are wholly owned by Salamander Farms, LLC which has sole voting

ITEM 13. CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS AND DIRECTOR
INDEPENDENCE 

(a) Transactions with Management and Others 

None. 

(b) Certain Business Relationships 

Under the Master Lease Agreement (the Agreement 
or MLA with the Rental Pool participants, the Resort pays Participants a quarterly distribution equal to 40 of the Adjusted
Gross Revenues on the first 10 million, 45 between 10 million and 11 million, and 50 above 11 million. Adjusted Gross Revenues are
defined as Gross Revenues less agent s commissions, audit fees, and occupancy fees and when the unit is used for Rental Pool Comps
or as a model, linen replacements and credit card fees. Each participant receives a fixed occupancy fee, based upon apartment size for
each day the unit is occupied. After allocation of occupancy fees and the payment of general Rental Pool expenses, the balance is allocated
proportionally to the participants, based on the Participation Factor as defined in the Agreement. Additionally, occupancy fees are paid
by the Resort to participants as rental fees for complimentary rooms unrelated to the Rental Pool operations. Associate room fees are
also paid by the Resort to Participants for total room revenues earned from the rental of condominiums by our employees. During the years
ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, amounts available to Participants under the Agreement approximated 1,451,000 and 2,702,000, respectively,
and during such years we paid Participants approximately 1,210,000 and 2,839,000, respectively. 

On August 20, 2018, the Second Addendum to the Master Lease
Agreement became effective. The addendum defined the Turn-Key renovation, the customization of certain units that did not require a full
renovation, and provided for an incentive payment plan Incentive to be paid to Participants. The Incentive provides for
a quarterly payment to each Participant, beginning on January 1, 2019 and ending on December 31, 2023, so long as their units continue
to participate in the Rental Pool. Incentive payments due as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 totaled 60,090 and 40,790, respectively,
which amounts are included in the Rental Pool liability on the respective consolidated balance sheets. 

On July 2, 2019, the Third Addendum to the MLA became
effective. The addendum provided Participants with two options for funding of the cost overruns created by the default of AMH. The
first option provided that we would fund the cost overruns in exchange for the Participating Owner s dedication of their unit
to the Rental Pool as evidenced by a Memorandum of Lease recorded against the title of such participant s unit in the land
records of Pinellas County. The second option provided an additional incentive payment equal to the cost overrun amount in the form
of quarterly payments, adjusted annually, resulting in a reimbursement of 10 of the total amount in 2019, 15 in 2020, 20 in 2021,
25 in 2022, and the remainder in 2023. Participants choosing option 1 represented 192 units (233 doors) and Participants choosing
option 2 represented 13 units (15 doors). For option 1, we paid Participants 3,146,363 in 2019, which amount is being amortized
over the five-year term of the Participants lease dedication beginning January 1, 2019 and ending on December 31, 2023. 

14 

Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement, the Rental Pool Lease
Operation reimbursed us approximately 153,000 and 142,000 in December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively for maintenance and housekeeping
labor, use of the telephone lines, and other supplies. 

All three condominiums that we own participated in the Rental
Pool under the Agreement in the same manner as all other Rental Pool participants in 2020 and 2019. 

At December 31, 2020 and 2019, accounts receivable, net includes
 132,075 and 172,703, respectively, due from Innisbrook Condominium Association, a third party collectively owned by the condominium
owners at Innisbrook. These receivables were recovered in 2021 and 2020, respectively. 

We incurred management fees to an affiliate of approximately
 662,000 and 1,129,000 in December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. 

We had amounts due to the Innisbrook Rental Pool Lease Operation
for the quarterly distribution of 325,081 and 528,001 at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. These amounts, which include the
incentives of 60,090 and 40, 790, respectively discussed above, were paid in 2021 and 2020, respectively. 

At December 31, 2020 and 2019, we owed an affiliate approximately
 1,780,000 and 1,764,000, respectively. The differences between these amounts and the balances of the due to affiliates in our consolidated
balance sheets arise from various affiliate receivables; none of which are significant. The affiliate receivables and payables are unsecured,
non-interest bearing and due on demand. 

(c) Indebtedness of Management 

None. 

(d) Transactions with Promoters 

Not applicable. 

ITEM 14. PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING FEES AND SERVICES 

The following fees were incurred from Cherry Bekaert LLP for services
provided in the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. 

Audit Fees were 75,000 for each of the fiscal years ended December
31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, for professional services rendered for the audit of our annual consolidated financial statements and
services that are normally provided by the auditors in connection with statutory filings or engagements for those fiscal years.

Report
of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 

To
the Sole Member and Manager 

 Salamander
Innisbrook, LLC 

 Palm Harbor, Florida 

Opinion
on the Consolidated Financial Statements 

We have
audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Salamander Innisbrook, LLC the Company as of December 31, 2020
and 2019, and the related consolidated statements of operations and changes in member s equity, and cash flows for each of the years
then ended, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements ). In our opinion, the
consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2020
and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America. 

Emphasis
of Matter 

As discussed
in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the previously issued 2018 financial statements did not include two companies previously
reported as affiliates that should have been consolidated as wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Company. Accordingly, various accounts as
of January 1, 2019 have been restated to include the previously unconsolidated entities. Our opinion is not modified with respect to this
matter. 

Basis for
Opinion 

These
consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion
on the Company s consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company
in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission
and the PCAOB. 

We conducted
our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company
is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits,
we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion
on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our
audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due
to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence
regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements.
We believe our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB.
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements
are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform,
an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal
control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal
control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.

Critical
Audit Matters 

The critical
audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were
communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to
the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication
of critical audit matters does not alter, in any way, our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are
not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or
disclosures to which they relate. 

Going Concern 

Description
of Matter 

As described
further in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has been negatively impacted by the outbreak of a novel coronavirus COVID-19 ), which resulted in a significant net loss during the year ended December 31, 2020 and negative cash flows from
operations. While it is unknown what the extent of the financial impact of COVID-19 will be, the Company has seen overall improvements
in operations and financial position in 2021. Additionally, the Company s debt obligation matures in April 2022 which requires principal
payments of approximately 10,900,000 in 2020, including a significant balloon payment at maturity. Currently management s forecasts
and related assumptions illustrate their ability to sufficiently fund operations for at least one year from the financial statement issuance
date. Additionally, the Company expects to refinance the debt with their current lender and will rely on the member s support, if
needed, to satisfy debt obligation (if necessary). 

Management
made judgments to conclude it is probable that the Company s plans will be effectively implemented and will provide the necessary
cash flows and member s support (if necessary) to fund the Company s obligations as they become due. The judgments with the
highest degree of impact and subjectivity in reaching this conclusion included the revenue growth and gross margin assumptions underlying
its forecast operating cash flows, its ability to reduce capital expenditures and other operating expenditures, and its ability to refinance
their debt obligation prior to maturity or access member funding, if necessary. As a result, a high degree of auditor judgment and increased
audit effort was required in performing audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of management s estimates. 

How We Addressed
the Matter in Our Audit 

Our audit procedures
included the following: 

Obtained communication from lender to support the Company s expectation of a debt refinance prior
to the debt s maturity in April 2022. 

Verified management s understanding that the guarantor of the Company s debt is wholly owned
by one individual, and we have assessed they have the ability to act on the guarantee if a refinance does not occur.

LLP 

We
have served as the Company s auditor since 2021.

SALAMANDER INNISBROOK, LLC 

 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

 December 31, 2020 and 2019 

1. Nature of Business 

Salamander Innisbrook, LLC (the Company ), own and operates
the Innisbrook Resort and Golf Club (the Resort ). The Company is owned by a sole member who does not have any personal liability
for any of the Company s obligations except as expressly provided by law and/or contractual obligation. The Company owns three condominiums
under Salamander Innisbrook Condominiums, LLC and all of the equity interests in Golf Host Securities, Inc. 

The Company controls and operates the Rental Pool Lease Operation (the
 Rental Pool ), a securitized pool of condominiums owned by participating condominium owners (the Participating Owners and rented as hotel rooms to guests of the Resort (an average of 248 units or 302 hotel rooms participate at any given time). Pursuant
to the Innisbrook Rental Pool Master Lease Agreement, dated January 1, 2014 (the Master Lease or MLA ), quarterly
distributions of a percentage of room revenues are required to be made to the condominium owners participating in the Rental Pool. Other
resort facilities include four 18-hole golf courses, four restaurants, three convention facilities, a health spa, fitness center, tennis
and recreation facilities, themed water park and six swimming pools. 

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 

Principles of Consolidation The accompanying consolidated
financial statements include the accounts and balances of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries, Salamander Innisbrook Securities,
LLC and Salamander Innisbrook Condominium, LLC (hereinafter collectively referred to as we , us , or our ).
All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. 

Restatement - Subsequent to the filing of the December 31,
2018 annual report, we determined two companies, Salamander Innisbrook Condominium, LLC and Salamander Innisbrook Securities, LLC, previously
reported as affiliates should have been consolidated as wholly owned subsidiaries of Salamander Innisbrook, LLC. We have further
determined that the impact is not material to the previously reported financial statements taken as a whole and therefore we have adjusted
the opening balance of the following accounts:

Statements of Cash Flows - For purposes
of the statements of cash flows, we consider all liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be
cash equivalents. 

In November 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ASU No. 2016-18, Statement of Cash Flows which requires that amounts
generally described as restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents be included with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the
beginning-of-period and end-of-period total amounts shown on the statement of cash flows. As a result, changes in restricted cash are
required to be classified as either operating activities, investing activities, or financing activities depending on the nature of the
activities that gave rise to the restrictions. Restricted cash consists primarily of funds held in a reserve account as required under
a note payable agreement executed March 28, 2017 with Branch Banking and Trust Company BB T (Note 10). We adopted
this standard on January 1, 2018. As a result, restricted cash reserves are included with cash on our consolidated statements of cash
flows. 

The following tables provide additional detail, by consolidated financial
statement line item, of the ASU 2016-18 impacts in the accompanying statements of cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2020 and
2019.

Revenues, Deferred Revenue and Accounts Receivable - Revenues
are derived from a variety of sources including, but not limited to, hotel, food and beverage operations, retail sales, golf course operations
and commissions on real estate transactions. With the exception of initiation fees and membership dues, all revenues net of any sales
and other taxes collected are recognized as products are delivered or services are performed. 

A performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct
good or service to the customer and is the unit of account under the new revenue recognition standard. The transaction price is allocated
to each distinct performance obligation and recognized as revenue when, or as, the performance obligation is satisfied. The majority of
our revenue is transactional and the contracts performance obligation is generally satisfied at the time of the transaction. 

Revenues from performance obligations satisfied over time include membership
dues, annual fees and initiation fees. The membership initiation fees at the Resort are nonrefundable and are initially recorded when
received as deferred revenue and amortized over the average life of a membership which, based on historical information, is deemed to
be ten years for full golf members and five years for resort and executive memberships. Membership dues and annual fees are recognized
over the applicable membership period (three months to one year depending on type of membership). 

Accounts receivable represent amounts due from our memberships, resort
guests and companies or individuals that held conferences or group stays at the Resort, net of the allowance for doubtful accounts. We
perform periodic credit evaluations of our customers and members and generally do not require collateral because we believe we have procedures
in place to minimize the possibility of significant losses occurring. Companies with a recent prior direct billing positive history with
the Resort are granted credit for billing. If companies have not been to the Resort within the past two years, an updated credit evaluation
is conducted. Terms are negotiable by group contract, but invoices are typically due 30 days from the receipt of invoice. 

We review accounts receivable monthly to determine if any receivables
are uncollectible. Any receivable considered to be doubtful of collection is included in the allowance for doubtful accounts. The balances
in the allowance for doubtful accounts were 32,772 and 5,455 as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. After all attempts to collect
the receivable have failed, the receivable is written off against the allowance. 

24 

In addition, gift card purchases and advanced event deposits are collected
and deferred and recognized as income as the service is performed at a future date. Deferred revenue includes unrecognized initiation
fee liabilities, unearned member dues, gift card liability and advanced events deposits. Deferred revenue was as follows as of December
31: 

2020 
 2019 
 
 Deferred Revenues - current portion 
 3,592,589 
 3,304,097 
 
 Deferred Revenues, net of current portion 
 1,086,508 
 1,045,429 

4,679,097 
 4,349,526 

Practical Expedients and Exemption - There are several practical
expedients and exemptions allowed under ASC 606 that impact timing of revenue recognition and our disclosures. Below is the practical
expedient we applied in the adoption and application of ASC 606: 

The Company treats similar contracts as part of a portfolio of contracts, primarily initiation fee contracts. The contracts for have the same provision terms, and management has the expectation the result will not be materially different from the consideration of each individual contract. 

Use of Estimates - The preparation of consolidated financial
statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities
and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues
and expenses during the reporting period. Estimates that are critical to the accompanying consolidated financial statements include our
beliefs that all of our long-lived assets, are recoverable, that our estimates of the average lives of memberships from which we base
our revenue recognition are reasonable and that no significant loss will result from the resolution of the litigation discussed in Note
5. Estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically and the effects of revisions are reflected in the periods they are determined to
be necessary. It is at least reasonably possible that our estimates could change in the near term with respect to these matters. 

Concentrations of Credit Risk - Financial instruments that potentially
subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and accounts receivable. Cash consists of bank deposits which
may, at times, exceed federally insured limits. No losses have been experienced in such accounts. 

We used the following methods and assumptions in estimating the fair
values of our financial instruments: 

Accounts receivable and accounts payable: Due to their short-term nature, the carrying amounts reported on the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets for these accounts approximate their fair values. 

Deferred revenues: The carrying amounts of these accounts approximate their fair values because they approximate their net present
values considering relevant risk factors. 

Debt: The carrying values of variable rate debt financing reflected
in the balance sheets at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 approximates their fair values as the changes in their associated interest
rates reflect the current market and credit risk is similar to when the loans were originally obtained. 

Liquidity Our consolidated financial statements are
prepared using accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America applicable to a going concern, which contemplate
the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. We suffered a significant net loss in 2020
primarily as a result of the COVID- 19 pandemic which forced us to temporarily close the Resort in 2020 and resulted in numerous cancellations.
While this pandemic remains a rapidly evolving situation, our results of operations and financial position have improved considerably
in 2021 as various restrictions resulting from the pandemic have been relaxed, and we are hopeful that such trend will continue throughout
the remainder of 2021 and beyond. However, the extent of the impact of COVID 19 on our business and financial results will depend
on future developments, including the duration and spread of the outbreak within the markets in which we operate, government actions and
programs, and the related impact on consumer confidence and spending, all of which are highly uncertain. 

Irrespective of the above, we believe that our cash on hand and additional
cash generated from operations will be adequate to meet our operating and capital obligations for the next twelve months, and that if
any short-term cash needs are necessary that our member will continue to provide capital to fund some needs. 

25 

We also have certain debt outstanding that requires principal
payments of approximately 10,900,000 in 2022, including a significant balloon payment in April of such year (see Note 10). We do
not currently have the cash to pay such indebtedness but believe we will be able to refinance it prior to its maturity. Because of
this and because we believe that our lender will continue
to provide forbearance with respect to certain debt covenant violations, the accompanying consolidated financial statements do not
include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and
classification of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern. 

Inventories and Supplies - Inventories and supplies are recorded
at the lower of cost, on a first-in, first-out basis, or market. 

Property, Buildings and Equipment, net Property, buildings
and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. We capitalize any asset purchase of 1,000 or more with
an estimated useful life of at least three years. Depreciation and amortization are recorded using the straight-line basis over the shorter
of the estimated useful lives of the assets, or if applicable, the lease terms. Estimated useful lives are generally as follows: 

Category 
 Average Lives 
(in Years) 
 
 Buildings 
 40 
 
 Land improvements 
 20 
 
 Machinery and equipment 
 3 to 7 
 
 Assets recorded under finance leases 
 3 to 4 

Costs of maintenance and repairs of property and equipment used in
operations are charged to expense as incurred, while renewals and betterments are capitalized. When property and equipment are replaced,
retired or otherwise disposed of, the costs are deducted from the asset and accumulated depreciation accounts. Gains or losses on sales
or retirements of equipment are recorded in operating income. 

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets - We regularly review
long-lived assets for impairment by comparing the carrying values of the assets with their estimated future undiscounted cash flows. If
it is determined that an impairment loss has occurred, the loss is recognized during that period. Any impairment loss would be calculated
as the difference between asset carrying values and fair value as determined by prices of similar items and other valuation techniques,
giving consideration to recent operating performance and pricing trends. There were no impairment losses for the years ended December
31, 2020 and 2019. 

Intangibles - Our indefinite life intangibles consist of our
trade name valued at 2,300,000 and a water contract valued at 2,030,001. We evaluate intangible assets for impairment annually (or earlier
if a significant event occurs that may indicate that the assets may not be recoverable). Factors we consider important, which could indicate
impairment, include the following: (1) significant under-performance relative to historical or projected future operating results;
(2) significant changes in the manner of the use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business; and (3) significant
negative industry or economic trends. During the fourth quarter of 2020 and 2019, respectively, we completed our annual intangible impairment
assessment, and determined that no impairment of intangible assets existed at December 31, 2020 and 2019. 

Deferred Financing Costs 
 Deferred financing costs, which arose from costs incurred to originate the financing discussed at Note 10,
are being amortized to interest expense over the term of the related indebtedness. The unamortized portions of these costs are reflected
as reductions of such debt. 

Deferred contract costs, net Deferred contract costs,
which arose from the costs of obtaining long term commitments on rental pool agreements that we would not have incurred if the pool participants
did not commit to five-year contracts, are being amortized over the contract lives using the straight-line method. 

Loss Contingencies - We estimate loss contingencies in accordance
with FASB ASC 450-20, Loss Contingencies , which states that a loss contingency shall be accrued by a charge to income if both of
the following conditions are met: (a) information available before the consolidated financial statements are issued or are available to
be issued indicates that it is probable that a liability had been incurred at the date of the consolidated financial statements and (b)
the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. 

26 

Advertising - Advertising costs, which are expensed as
incurred, were 452,640 and 572,789 for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. 

Leases - Leases are classified as finance leases or operating
leases dependent on whether the lease transfers substantially all of the benefits and risks of ownership of property. Assets and liabilities
are recorded at amounts equal to the present value of the minimum lease payments at the beginning of the lease term. Interest expense
relating to the lease liabilities is recorded to affect constant rates of interest over the terms of the leases. Refer to Recently
Adopted Accounting Pronouncements for further discussion on leases. 

Income Taxes With the exception of an entity owned by Salamander
Innisbrook Securities, LLC for which income taxes have been minimal the Company, and its subsidiaries are single-member limited liability
companies, and therefore, no provision or liability for federal or state income taxes has been included in the accompanying consolidated
financial statements. The results of our consolidated operations are included in the income tax return of our member. 

We have adopted the provisions of FASB ASC 740-10, Accounting for
Uncertainty in Income Taxes . Under ASC 740-10, we are required to evaluate each of our tax positions to determine if they are more
likely than not to be sustained if the taxing authority examines the respective position. A tax position includes an entity s
tax status as a pass-through entity, and the decision not to file a tax return. We have evaluated each of our tax positions and
have determined that no provision or liability for income taxes is necessary. 

We evaluate the validity of our conclusions regarding uncertain income
tax positions on an annual basis to determine if facts or circumstances have arisen that might cause us to change our judgment regarding
the likelihood of a tax position s sustainability under examination. Our member files income tax returns in the U.S.
federal jurisdiction and the State of Virginia. At December 31, 2020, we do not believe that any uncertain tax positions exist. 

3. Property, Buildings and Equipment 

Property, buildings, and equipment consist of the following as of December
31, 2020 and 2019: 

2020

 34,711,326 

Depreciation and amortization expense was 1,712,020 and 1,940,256
for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we wrote off fixed assets
of 0 and 972,168, respectively. Amortization expense and related accumulated amortization for assets previously held under finance leases
(see Note 4) was 53,099 and 2,037,753 respectively, as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 375,830 and 1,984,654 as of
and for the year ended December 31, 2019, respectively. 

4. Leases 

Operating Leases 

On August 1, 2015, we entered into a master lease agreement with Agricredit-Acceptance,
LLC which provided two leases for golf carts and utility vehicles (with payments commencing in December 2015). The term of each lease
was 48 months and the monthly lease payments were approximately 21,200 and 11,100 respectively. 

On December 20, 2018, we entered into a master lease agreement with
DLL Finance, LCC for vehicles by Club Car, LLC. The agreement provides for three leases of golf cars and utility vehicles, with payments
beginning on April 1, 2019. The term of each lease is 48 months and the monthly lease payments total approximately 32,300. 

27 

As of
December 31, 2020, the remaining lease term in years approximated 2.25 and the discount rate was 4.41 . Operating
lease liabilities are recorded based on the present value of the future lease payments over the lease terms. Future minimum lease payments
under operating leases for the years ended December 31 are as follows: 

Years Ending December 31, 

2021 
 387,459 
 
 2022 
 387,459 
 
 2023 
 96,865 
 
 Total future minimum lease payments 
 871,783 

Less imputed interest 
 (43,304 

Total present value of future minimum lease payments 
 828,479 

Operating
lease expense approximated 387,000 for each of the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. 

Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements In February 2016,
the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the FASB ), issued Accounting Standards Update ASU ), No. 2016-02, Leases ,
which requires an entity to record on its balance sheet previously unrecorded operating leases based on the present value of remaining
lease payments. We adopted this standard on its effective date of January 1, 2019 under the modified retrospective method and using the
optional transition method to apply the new lease accounting standard prospectively as of January 1, 2019, rather than as of the earliest
period presented. Therefore, the adoption of the new lease accounting standard did not change our previous reported consolidated financial
statements. In addition, we elected the package of practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance within the new standard.
This allowed us to carry forward the historical lease classification and not reassess whether a contract is or contains a lease, or determination
of initial direct costs. Adoption of this standard resulted in the recording of an operating lease right-of-use ROU assets
and corresponding operating lease liability of approximately 1,424,000, respectively. The adoption did not have a material impact on
our consolidated financial statements. 

Finance Lease 

During
the fourth quarter of 2014, the Company entered into a master lease agreement with PNC Equipment Finance, LLC for the lease of golf course
equipment. The term of each lease was 60 months, with interest rates ranging from 2 to 4.45 , and the monthly lease payments varied in
amount. The leases contained bargain purchase options that allowed us to purchase the leased equipment for a minimal amount upon the expiration
of the lease term. Equipment acquired under capital leases was pledged as collateral to secure the performance of the future minimum lease
payments. 

In April 2019, we exercised our option to purchase the equipment. As
such, at December 31, 2019, we had no remaining obligation under these leases. 

5. Contingency 

We are currently involved in certain litigation arising from an
Agri-credit construction contract we entered (as agent for and on behalf of the Rental Pool participants) with AMH Construction,
Inc. AMH in the amount of 3,420,670. The renovation was performed as a Turn-Key project with each
Participating Owner paying their respective share of the total costs. We, and the Lessors' Advisory Committee of the Rental Pool LAC ), jointly supervised the renovation. On January 23, 2019, we terminated the contract with AMH for breach of
contract, including AMH's failure to complete the renovation work in accordance with the contract schedule. On April 18, 2019, we
served a demand letter to AMH asserting damages of 4,423,070 for the additional costs incurred by the Participating Owners and
return of deposits made for work that was not performed. On August 30, 2019, we filed a lawsuit in Pinellas County, Florida against
AMH seeking damages for breach of contract in the amount of 4,423,070 plus attorney fees and other costs of approximately 364,400
in 2019. On October 31, 2019, AMH filed a response to our suit including a counterclaim in the amount of 890,751. AMH alleges in
its counterclaim that it was not compensated for work performed. In March 2020, Pinellas County suspended all hearings until further
notice due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Due to the early stages of litigation, possible outcomes and impacts to our consolidated
financial statements are not yet reasonably determinable; accordingly, our consolidated financial statements do not give effect to
any gain or loss that may result from the resolution of these matters.

6. Retirement Plan 

We sponsor a defined contribution retirement plan, which provides retirement
benefits for all eligible employees. Employees must fulfill a 90-day service requirement to be eligible to participate in this plan. We
match one half of the first 6 of the contributions of each employee. We made matching contributions of approximately 133,000 and 265,000
for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. 

7. Rental Pool Operations 

In December 2013, we entered a Master Lease Agreement Agreement with the Rental Pool s Lessors Advisory Committee LAC ). The Agreement commenced on January 1, 2014 for a period of
ten years, replacing all lease agreements previously in existence. Under the Agreement, the Resort pays the Participant a quarterly distribution
equal to 40 of the Adjusted Gross Revenues on the first 10 million, 45 between 10 million and 11 million, and 50 above 11 million.
The Participants are also entitled to 35 nights in-season and complimentary gift certificates for golf and food beverage. Their
guests will be entitled to the same privileges as the Participants when occupying the participant s units. During the years ended
December 31, 2020 and 2019, amounts available to Participants under the Agreement approximated 1,451,000 and 2,702,000 respectively
and during such years we paid Participants approximately 1,210,000 and 2,839,000, respectively. 

On August 20, 2018, the Second Addendum to the Master Lease
Agreement became effective. The addendum defined the Turn-Key renovation, the customization of certain units that did not require a
full renovation, and provided for an incentive payment plan Incentive to be paid by us to the Participants. The
Incentive provides for a quarterly payment to each participant, beginning on January 1, 2019 and ending on December 31, 2023, so
long as the unit continues to participate in the Rental Pool. Incentive payments due as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019
totaled 60,090 and 40,790 respectively, and are included in the Rental Pool liability on the consolidated balance sheets. 

On July 2, 2019, the Third Addendum to the MLA became effective. The
addendum provided with two options for funding of the cost overruns created by the default of AMH. The first option provided that we would
fund the cost overruns in exchange for the Participating Owner s dedication of their unit to the Rental Pool as evidenced by a Memorandum
of Lease recorded against the title of such participant s unit in the land records of Pinellas County. The second option provided
an additional incentive payment equal to the cost overrun amount in the form of quarterly payments, adjusted annually, resulting in a
reimbursement of 10 of the total amount in 2019, 15 in 2020, 20 in 2021, 25 in 2022, and the remainder in 2023. Participants choosing
option 1 represented 192 units (233 doors) and Participants choosing option 2 represented 13 units (15 doors). For option 1, we paid Participants
 3,146,363 in 2019, which amount is being amortized over the five-year term of the participants lease dedication beginning January
1, 2019 and ending on December 31, 2023. Amortization expense of this asset (the net amounts are reflected as Deferred Contract Costs
in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets) in 2020 and 2019 totaled 794,600 and 253,745, respectively and is included in depreciation
and amortization expense.

8. Related Party Transactions 

We incurred management fees to Salamander Hospitality, LLC, an entity
related to us by virtue of common ownership, of 661,708 and 1,129,000 in 2020 and 2019, respectively. These fees are included in general
and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. 

At December 31, 2020 and 2019, accounts receivable, net includes 132,075
and 172,703, respectively, due from Innisbrook Condominium Association, a third party collectively owned by the condominium owners at
Innisbrook. These receivables were recovered in 2021 and 2020, respectively. 

At December 31, 2020 and 2019, we owed our affiliate approximately
 1,780,000 and 1,764,000, respectively. The differences between these amounts and the balances of the due to affiliates in our consolidated
balance sheets arise from various affiliate receivables; none of which are significant., The affiliate receivables and payables are unsecured,
non-interest bearing and are due on demand. 

The Innisbrook Rental Pool Lease Operation paid us approximately 153,000
and 142,000 as reimbursement for maintenance and housekeeping labor, use of the telephone lines and other supplies during the years ended
December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. These reimbursements are reflected as reductions of general and administrative expenses in the
accompanying consolidated statements of operations. 

We had amounts due to the Innisbrook Rental Pool Lease Operation for
the quarterly distribution of 325,081 and 528,001 at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. These amounts were paid in 2021 and 2020,
respectively. 

All three of the condominiums that we own participated in the Rental
Pool under the Agreement in 2020 and 2019, in the same manner as all other Rental Pool participants. 

9. Paycheck Protection Program Loan 

In April 2020, we received a Paycheck Protection Program loan PPP
loan of 3,394,500. At December 31, 2020, the loan had an interest rate of 1 and a term of 5 years, however under the program,
the loan, and related accrued interest, was eligible to be forgiven by the Small Business Administration SBA for costs
we incurred for payroll, rent, utilities, and other allowable expenses in 2020. In 2020, we used the full amount received from the PPP
loan for eligible expenses and in 2021 received notice that the entire PPP loan had been forgiven by the Small Business Administration.
As such, the balance of the loan will be reflected in other income in our 2021 consolidated statement of operations. 

10. Note Payable 

On March 28, 2017, we obtained a loan in the amount of fifteen million
dollars 15,000,000) from Branch Banking and Trust Company BB T ). The loan is being repaid over a five-year period
in monthly installments of principal plus interest based on a 15-year amortization schedule commencing on May 5, 2017, with the remaining
unpaid balance due in full on April 5, 2022. Interest on this loan is being charged at the One Month LIBOR Rate plus two and one quarter
percent 2.25 per annum adjusted monthly on the first day of each LIBOR interest period (2.44 as of December 31, 2020). The loan is collateralized
by our real and personal property, the assignment and/or subordination of leases and our management agreement with an affiliate and guarantees
by certain affiliates. 

The loan agreement contains customary financial
covenants, including a covenant to maintain a debt service coverage ratio of at least 1.10 to 1.0, measured annually at the end of each
fiscal year and a covenant to maintain a tangible net worth of not less than 15,000,000 at all times. Violations of any such covenants
and provisions would allow BB T to accelerate the repayment of the indebtedness. At December 31, 2020, we were in violation of certain
covenants, however BB T has waived their rights with respect to such acceleration. 

As part of our loan agreement, we deposited 1,500,000 into a cash
reserve account in March 2017. On February 28, 2018, we deposited an additional 1,000,000 into such account as required. The loan amendment
that occurred in April 2019 included the release of 500,000 from the cash reserve account which was used to pay down the note. The remaining
reserve account is restricted and may not be used to service the loan. 

30 

At December
31, 2019, the loan had a balance of 12,336,558, which amount was net of unamortized deferred financing costs of 156,320. Future scheduled
maturities under the note are as follows as of December 31, 2020: 

Years ending December 31, 

2021

11. Other Subsequent Events 

In June 2021, we received 2,000,000 under a second round PPP loan. The
loan accrues interest at 1 and all or a portion of the loan and accrued interest will be eligible for forgiveness by the SBA if we expend
such amount for payroll, rent, utilities, and other allowable expenses during the covered period, as defined. If the loan is
not forgiven, it would have a term of five years with interest payments commencing in October 2022.

SUPPLEMENTAL SCHEDULES OF RENTAL POOL LEASE
OPERATION 

HISTORICAL SUMMARY 

The following financial statements of the Innisbrook Rental Pool Lease
Operation (the Rental Pool are for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. 

The operation of the Rental Pool is tied closely to the Resort operations.
The Rental Pool Master Lease Agreement provides for a quarterly distribution of a percentage of the room revenues to participating condominium
owners Participants ), as defined in the agreements (see Note 1 of the Rental Pool Lease Operation financial statements).
Because the Rental Pool participants share in a percentage of the room revenues, the condominium units allowing Rental Pool participation
are deemed to be securities. However, there is no market for such securities other than through sales of the normal real estate market.
Since the security is related to real estate, no dividends have been paid or will be paid.

Report of Independent
Registered Public Accounting Firm 

To
the Sole Member and Manager 
Salamander Innisbrook, LLC and 

 the
Lessors of the Innisbrook Rental Pool Lease Obligation 

 Palm
Harbor, Florida 

Opinion
on the Financial Statements 

We have
audited the accompanying balance sheets of the Distribution Fund and the Maintenance Fund of the Innisbrook Rental Pool Lease Operation
(the Rental Pool (funds created for participants who have entered into a rental pool agreement as explained in Note 1)
as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the related statements of operations and changes in participants fund balances of the Distribution
Fund and statements of changes in participants fund balances of the Maintenance Escrow Fund for years then ended, and the related
notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements ). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of the Rental Pool as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and
changes in participants fund balances for years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America. 

Basis for
Opinion 

These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Rental Pool s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the
Rental Pool s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Rental Pool in accordance
with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We conducted
our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Rental Pool is
not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits,
we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion
on the effectiveness of the Rental Pool s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our
audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or
fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe our audits provide
a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

Critical
Audit Matters 

The critical
audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated
or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial
statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. We determined there are no critical audit matters.

INNISBROOK RENTAL POOL LEASE OPERATION 

 SUPPLEMENTAL NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

 December 31, 2020 and 2019 

1. Nature of the Rental Pool Lease Operation and Agreements 

Overview - The Innisbrook Rental Pool Lease Operation
(the Rental Pool consists of condominiums located on the premises of the Innisbrook Resort and Golf Club (the Company ,
 Resort or Innisbrook ), which are leased by their owners (the Participants to Innisbrook for
the purpose of making such units available for resort accommodations. Salamander Innisbrook, LLC, as owner and operator of the Resort,
administers the Rental Pool. 

The Rental Pool operation is highly dependent upon the operations of
the Resort, and likewise, the Resort is also dependent upon the continued participation of condominium owners in the Rental Pool. Additionally,
the Rental Pool and Resort are both impacted by the general economic conditions related to the destination resort industry. 

Rental Pool Agreements - The Rental Pool operates under
the provisions of a Master Lease Agreement (the MLA or Agreement approved by Company management and the Lessors
Advisory Committee LAC ). The Agreement commenced on January 1, 2014 for a period of ten years, replacing all lease agreements
previously in existence. 

Under the Agreement, the Resort pays the Participant a quarterly distribution
equal to 40 of the Adjusted Gross Revenues on the first 10 million, 45 between 10 million and 11 million, and 50 above 11 million.
Adjusted Gross Revenues are defined as Gross Revenues less agent s commissions, audit fees, occupancy fees or when the unit is used
for Rental Pool Comps or as a model, linen replacements and credit card fees. Each participant receives a fixed occupancy fee, based upon
apartment size, for each day the unit is occupied. After allocation of occupancy fees and the payment of general Rental Pool expenses,
the balance is allocated proportionally to the Participants, based on the Participation Factor as defined in the Agreement. Additionally,
occupancy fees are paid by the Resort to Participants as rental fees for complimentary rooms unrelated to the Rental Pool operations.
Associate room fees are also paid by the Resort to Participants for total room revenues earned from the rental of condominiums by Company
employees. 

Under the terms of the Agreement, each owner may elect to participate
in the Rental Pool for the following year by signing and executing an Annual Lease Agreement (the ALA ). 

On August 20, 2018, the Second Addendum to the Master Lease Agreement
became effective. The addendum defined the Turn-Key renovation, the Customization of certain units that did not require a full renovation,
and provided for an Incentive to be paid by the Company to the participants. The Incentive provides for a quarterly payment to each participant,
beginning on January 1, 2019 and ending on December 31, 2023, so long as the unit continues to participate in the Rental Pool. 

On June 13, 2019, the Third Addendum to the Master Lease Agreement
became effective. The addendum provided with two options for funding of the cost overruns created by the default of the AMH contractor.
The first option provided for the Company to fund the cost overruns in exchange for the participant s dedication of the unit to
the Rental Pool as evidenced by a Memorandum of Lease recorded against the title of such participant s unit in the land records
of Pinellas County. The second option provided an additional incentive equal to the cost overrun amount in the form of quarterly payments,
adjusted annually, resulting in a reimbursement of 10 of the total amount in 2019, 15 in 2020, 20 in 2021, 25 in 2022, and the remainder
in 2023. The additional incentive is included in Incentive s adjustment to net income distribution on the statement of operations
for the distribution fund. 

Nature of Accounts and Fund Balances - The Rental Pool
consists of the Distribution Fund and the Maintenance Escrow Fund. The Distribution Fund s balance sheet primarily reflects amounts
receivable from the Company for the Rental Pool distribution payable to Participants and amounts due to the Maintenance Escrow Fund. The
operations of the Distribution Fund reflect the calculation of pooled earnings, management fees and adjustments, as defined. 

The Maintenance Escrow Fund, which is managed by the LAC reflects the
accounting for certain escrowed assets of the Participants and, therefore, has no operations. It consists primarily of amounts escrowed
on behalf of Participants or amounts due from the Distribution Fund to meet minimum escrow requirements, fund the carpet care reserve,
maintain the interior of the units, and fund renovations of the units. The Innisbrook Rental Pool Trust was established on February 1,
2002 to create a Trust, which holds certain assets maintained in such escrow accounts. 

39 

Maintenance Escrow Fund Accounts - The MLA provides
that 90 of the Occupancy Fees earned by each Participant are deposited in the Participant s Maintenance Escrow Fund account.
Beginning in 2011, by mutual agreement between the LAC and the Resort, until it is determined that the fund requires replenishment,
both the occupancy fee (Paragraph 7.3 of the MLA) and the carpet care reserve (Paragraph 1.6 of the MLA) deposit amounts will be 0 .
This account provides funds for payment of amounts that are due from Participants under the Agreement for maintenance and
refurbishment services. Should a Participant s balance fall below that necessary to provide adequate funds for maintenance and
replacements, the Participant is required to restore the escrow balance to a defined minimum level. The MLA provides for specific
fund balances to be maintained, by unit type, size and age of refurbishment, as defined in the Agreement. Under the MLA, a
percentage of the occupancy fees are deposited into the carpet care reserve in the Maintenance Escrow Fund, which bears the expenses
of carpet cleaning for all Participants. This percentage is estimated to provide the amount necessary to fund carpet cleaning
expenses and may be adjusted annually. The amounts expended for carpet care were approximately 17,000 and 2,600 for the years
ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. 

The LAC invests the maintenance escrow funds on behalf of the Participants
and in compliance with restrictions in the Agreements. The LAC consists of nine Participants elected to advise the Resort owner in Rental
Pool matters and negotiate amendments to the lease agreement. Income earned on these investments is allocated proportionately to Participants 
Maintenance Escrow Fund accounts and paid quarterly. 

2. Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies 

Basis of Accounting - The accounting records of the funds
are maintained on the accrual basis of accounting. 

Cash - Cash consists of bank deposits which may, at times,
exceed federally insured limits. No losses have been experienced in such accounts. 

Certificates of Deposit - The LAC invests amounts maintained
in the maintenance escrow fund primarily in certificates of deposit held with a financial institution. As of December 31, 2019, the certificates
had an interest rate of 2.30 and had six-month maturities. As of December 31, 2019, accrued interest earned was 254, which amount is
included in the accompanying financial statements of the maintenance escrow fund. At December 31, 2019, the cost of these investments
approximates fair value. 

Revenue - All room revenue net of any sales and other
taxes collected are recognized as services are performed. 

Accounts Receivable - Receivables are presented net of
any allowances for uncollectible amounts. All receivable balances reflected in the accompanying financial statements as of December 31,
2020 and 2019, were collected in 2021 and 2020, respectively. As such, an allowance for doubtful accounts is not considered necessary
as of December 31, 2020 and 2019. 

Use of Estimates - The preparation of financial statements
in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates, judgments
and assumptions which affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the
financial statements and the reported revenues and expenses during the reporting period may be affected by the estimates and assumptions
management is required to make. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 

Income Taxes - No federal or state taxes have been reflected
in the accompanying financial statements as the tax effect of fund activities accrue to the Participants. The Innisbrook Rental
Pool Trust files an annual tax return, which remains subject to examination by taxing authorities for years on or after 2016. The
Rental Pool and related Trust have adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification Topic 740-10, Accounting
for Uncertainty in Income Taxes . This topic requires the Rental Pool and the related Trust to evaluate each of their tax positions
and the information reported in the Trust s tax return to determine if such information and positions are more likely than not to
be sustained under examination by a taxing authority. A tax position includes an entity s tax status, which includes considerations
as to the qualifications of the Trust and the decision that all fund activities pass through to the participants of the Rental Pool. 

The Rental Pool and trustees of the Trust have evaluated their tax
positions and have determined that no provision or liability for income taxes is necessary. Conclusions regarding uncertain tax positions
are evaluated on an annual basis to determine if facts or circumstances have arisen that might cause a change in judgment regarding the
likelihood of a tax position s sustainability under examination. At December 31, 2020, the Innisbrook Rental Pool Trust believes
that no uncertain tax positions exist. 

40 

NOTE 3 - RELATED PARTY
TRANSACTIONS

in the accompanying balance sheets of the Maintenance Escrow Fund include approximately 0 and 15,520, respectively, payable to the Company
for such items.
