PART I 

ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

Cavitation Technologies, Inc. (referred to herein,
unless otherwise indicated, as the Company, CTi, we, us, and our is a Nevada corporation originally incorporated under the name Bio Energy, Inc. We are a process and product development firm that has
developed, patented, and commercialized environmentally friendly technology-based systems that are designed to serve large, growing, global
markets such as vegetable oil refining, renewable fuels, water treatment, wines and spirits enhancement, algae oil extraction, water-oil
emulsions and crude oil yield improvement.Our systems are designed to process industrial liquids at a reduced processing time,
lower operating cost, improved yield while operating in environmentally friendly manner. Our patented Nano Reactor and LPN 
are the critical components of our business and we have generated all of our revenue while utilizing these components. 

Covid-19 

In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared
coronavirus COVID-19 a global pandemic. This contagious disease outbreak, which has continued to spread, has adversely affected workforces,
customers, economies, and financial markets globally. It has also disrupted the normal operations of many businesses. This outbreak could
decrease spending, adversely affect demand for the Company s products, and harm the Company s business and results of operations.
During the year ended June 30, 2021, the Company believes the COVID-19 pandemic did not materially impact its operating results due to
the nature of the Company s business and its operations. The Company has not observed any impairments of its assets or a significant
change in the fair value of its assets due to the COVID-19 pandemic. At this time, it is not possible for the Company to predict the duration
or magnitude of the adverse results of the outbreak and its effects on the Company s business or results of operations, financial
condition, or liquidity. 

Vegetable Oil Refining 

Our first commercial application for our technology
has been the CTi Nano Neutralization System which has been utilized to improve edible vegetable oil refining process. Our
environmentally friendly process has been shown to reduce refining costs, increase oil yield, and limit the number of chemical additives
used in chemical refining of vegetables oils. This patented process (US Patent # 7,762,715 and # 8,042,989) is designed to be incorporated
into new and existing soybean, rapeseed, canola and palm vegetable oil refineries. 

Our first pilot test of our CTi NANO Neutralization 
System was conducted in 2010 at Carolina Soya, a 200-metric ton/day crude soy oil refining plant in Estill, South Carolina. Our second
system, which became operational in fiscal 2011, has been continuously utilized since 2011 at the plant that processes approximately 450
metric tons per day of soy oil. Further, we have successfully shipped over 50 systems domestically and internationally. We also continuously
focus on developing additional Nano Reactor applications and managing the intellectual property issues associated with new
processes and applications. 

The global consumption of vegetable oils has grown
consistently at a rate of about 4.1 p.a. from 90.5 million metric tons (MMT) in 2001 to approximately 214 million metric tons (MMT) in
2020-2021. In 2021-2020 consumption of vegetable oil was 214 MMT compared to 209 MMT in 2019-2020, an increase of 2.4 . (https://www.statista.com/statistics/263937/vegetable-oils-global-consumption/).
It is also a highly competitive commodity market in which the lowest-cost producer has the advantage. 

Desmet Ballestra Agreement 

On May 14, 2012, we signed a global R D,
Marketing and Technology License Agreement with Desmet Ballestra Group s.a. (Desmet), a Belgian company that is actively marketing
the NANO Neutralization System, the key component of which is our Nano Reactor to soybean and other vegetable
oil refiners. The Agreement provided Desmet (licensee) a limited, exclusive license and right to develop, design and supply our NANO
Neutralization System which incorporates Nano Reactor devices on a global basis tools and fats and oleo chemical
applications. The agreement expired in May 2015. 

3 

On January 22, 2016, the agreement was renewed
and we signed a similar three-year agreement with Desmet effective August 1, 2015, that expired on August 1, 2018. As part of the agreement,
Desmet was to provide, under certain conditions, limited monthly advance payments of 50,000 to be applied against gross profit share
from future sales. 

On October 1, 2018, Desmet and the Company executed
a new three year License Agreement with essentially the same terms with the January 2016 agreement. As part of the agreement, Desmet provided
us monthly advances of 50,000 through October 1, 2021, to be applied against gross profit share from future sales. The agreement expired
on October 1, 2021, and Desmet and CTi are currently working on similar three year global marketing and sales agreement. The Company anticipates
the signing of a new agreement on or before December 31, 2021. 

Desmet, together with its affiliates, is a global
engineering and equipment supply firm engaged in the development, design and supply of process equipment for oils and fats processing
facilities including vegetable oil refining, biofuel, oleo chemical, seed crushing, surfactant and detergent markets. Desmet supplies
these markets with services based on the latest globally sourced technologies. Desmet has relationships with major refiners globally
A significant portion of global vegetable oil refineries include major refiners such as Archer Daniels Midland Company, Cargill, Inc.
and Bunge Limited. Desmet has more than 40 sales representatives selling in North America, South America, Europe, and Asia. Since its
founding in 1946, Desmet reports that it has built a global network that includes 1,300 employees, 17 global and 8 representative offices,
and more than 6,000 lines in a variety of applications. Desmet operates a separate division for each of the above markets and the Desmet
Oils Fats division has supplied small and large plants to approximately 1,900 oil millers in 150 countries, covering over 6,300
process sections. 

Along with Desmet, we have been working together
to accelerate appropriate sales goals and installation process. Our CTi Nano Neutralization Systems is designed to be used
as an add-on process to an existing neutralization system within soybean and other vegetable oil refineries. Desmet s focus has
been on marketing our CTi Nano Neutralization Systems to vegetable oil refiners to help them increase profits through cost
savings and improved oil yields. Desmet purchases our CTi Nano Neutralization Systems from us and installs them at the refinery
as part of an integrated neutralization system. Based on successful commercial implementations, Desmet guarantees minimum economic benefits
to a facility that installs our CTi Nano Neutralization Systems . We are therefore substantially dependent on Desmet to identify
prospects, complete sales contracts, install the system and manage relationships with end-users. 

Additionally, in fiscal 2017 Desmet installed
our first Nano Reactor at a bio-diesel production plant in South America. Bio-diesel industry has been under pricing pressure
for a considerable period of time and slow to adopt to newer technologies. We are continuously working with Desmet pursuing additional
sales opportunities in Asia and South America, however, the acceptance of our technology has been slow and there were no sales generated
in our Fiscal 2021. 

GEA Westfalia Agreement 

In August
2012, we entered into a Technology and Licensing Agreement with the GEA Group AG - Westfalia Separator Group GEA pursuant
to which the companies agreed to jointly develop and patent new applications of our core technologies. As part of the Agreement, GEA Westfalia
was to assemble a complete commercial test system comprising Nano Reactors . This Agreement was terminated in January 2017. 

In January
2017 we have entered into a new three-year global technology license, R D and marketing agreement with GEA that expired on January
1, 2020, covering our patented Nano Reactors technology, processes and applications. Under this agreement, GEA was granted
a worldwide exclusive license to integrate our patented technology into water treatment application, milk and juice pasteurization, and
certain food related processes. The license agreement between us and GEA had a three-year term and provided for the payment of 300,000
per year in advanced license fees to us. The Company had received approximately 877,000 in advances from GEA under this agreement. Our
agreement with GEA expired on January 1, 2020 and was not renewed. As a result of the termination of the agreement with GEA, we recognized
approximately 877,000 in revenue during the year ended June 30, 2020 to account for advances we received since January 2017 that was
previously recorded as advances from distributors.

Enviro Watertek, LLC 

In April 2019, we have entered into a licensing
and service contract agreement with Enviro Watertek, LLC EW ). This agreement covers our first commercial entrance into
industrial treatment of produced and frac water. Fracking industry has seen a significant growth over the past ten years, reaching daily
water consumption volume of over 58 million barrels per day. Our newly designed Low Pressure Nano Reactor LPN was specifically developed to be integrated into produced water treatment system along with our proprietary chemical formulations, and
has depicted measurable and quantifiable advantages over industry standard processes and equipment. Our agreement with EW provides for
sales on LPN plus recurring revenue stream based on processing of produced
and frac water volumes and utilization. Our agreement with EW has a fifteen-year term. We sold our first LPN 
system in the third quarter of our fiscal 2019, while generating additional LPN sales
and recurring revenue in our fiscal 2020. In March 2020, global pandemic of COVID-19 has taken an unexpected negative impact on the oil
and gas industry worldwide, and has consequently impaired our ability to rapidly accelerate LPN 
sales and recurring revenue stream. While the industry has gone through a major overhaul, we are seeing a gradual recovery in the industry.
Our current system installations can handle approximately 25,000 barrels per day (BPD) and we anticipate an increased capacity coming
on line in our Fiscal 2022. 

Alchemy Beverages, Inc 

In fiscal 2014, Roman Gordon, one of our shareholders
and a former officer, formed a company, Cameo USA LLC (Cameo). Since its formation, Cameo has had no revenue, no operations, and has had
no assets or liabilities. On June 4, 2018, Mr. Gordon contributed his 100 interest in Cameo to Cavitation Technologies, Inc. As Mr. Gordon
had no reasonable and objectively supportable basis in the valuation of his investment in Cameo, there was no value assigned to the contribution
of Cameo. 

On June 29, 2018, we agreed to license Cameo to
Alchemy Beverages Inc. ABI ). In addition, we have agreed to provide certain licensing rights related to our miniature low
pressure nano-reactor (MLPN) to be used in developing and manufacturing of small home appliances to enhance alcoholic beverages. In consideration
for these ABI has agreed to issue 19.9 of ABI s outstanding common shares to us (limited to 20 million shares of ABI). ABI is a
private company and in the business of producing and selling alcoholic beverages, equipment, and home appliances. Prior to this agreement,
ABI was independent of CTI and had no relation to us nor to our management. 

Pursuant to the licensing agreements, ABI will
have the exclusive global marketing and distribution rights of Cameo and our patented and patent pending technologies for the processing
of alcoholic beverages. We have agreed to assist in the installation and maintenance of the MLPN to ABI and will receive royalty payments
ranging from 1 to 3 on all net revenues, as defined in our license agreement for the life of the applicable patents. In addition, we
will receive leasing, consulting, and manufacturing fees as defined in the licensing agreement. 

To date, ABI hasn t generated any sales
under Cameo brand. Since June 2018, the Company and ABI have developed a small table top home appliance unit Barmuze utilizing MLPN
, allowing consumers to experience a new way of enjoying wines and spirits, utilizing CTi s patented and patent pending technologies
to molecularly restructure alcohol, convert harsh acids to pleasant tasting esters, and reduce levels of certain impurities commonly present
in alcohol. 

On February 26, 2019, we have filed an application
with U.S. Patent office, U.S. Patent Application No. 16/286,309 SYSTEM AND METHOD
FOR PURIFICATION OF DRINKING WATER, ETHANOL AND ALCOHOL BEVERAGES OF IMPURITIES and on October 24, 2018, U.S. Patent Application
No. 16/169,644 METHOD AND DEVICE FOR PRODUCING OF HIGH QUALITY ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES . 

During fiscal 2021, we have received approval
for several patent applications, protecting our technology and processing rights, meanwhile expanding our broad portfolio of patents. 

5 

During fiscals 2021 and 2020, there were no sales
or royalties generated pertaining to our agreement with Alchemy Beverages, Inc. The investment in ABI has no value assigned to it, which
approximates its fair value. 

Customers Dependence 

We continue to sell our industrial capacity Nano
Reactor and Nano Neutralization System through our strategic partner Desmet and most of our revenue for the fiscal
year ended June 30, 2021, was derived from sales of reactors to Desmet and the corresponding gross profit share. We have generated minimal
revenue pertaining to our licensing agreement with EW in our fiscal 2021. We had no sales of LPN 
due to COVID-19 that has significantly impacted oil production in US. Meanwhile, we are starting to see oil and gas industry early stage
recovery and foresee a great opportunity for our technology providing a significant upside potential both at the point of sale and recurring
revenue stream. 

Sources and availability of raw materials and
the names of principal suppliers 

We have historically sourced reactor components
from various domestic and international suppliers. We do not have any long-term contracts, agreements, or commitments with any supplier.
We believe it would take approximately 30 days to find a new supplier, if necessary. 

Competition 

Our competitors who sell equipment and engineering
services for the vegetable oil refining business are a myriad of companies both large and small that provide equipment and technology
to oil refiners. These include known companies that have longer operating histories, more experience, and stronger financial capabilities.
Competitors include Alfa Laval, and Crown Iron Works as well as many firms that provide advice and services to small and regional firms.
In addition, Arisdyne Systems, a designer of cavitation devices, is marketing a system using similar technology. The vegetable oil refining
business is a highly competitive commodity market in which the lowest-cost producer has the advantage. We intend to compete by offering
solutions that help our clients remain or become a low-cost producer. Because the industry in which we compete has had limited new technology
introduced in the last 50 years, we believe our CTi Nano Neutralization Systems provide a unique opportunity for refiners
to increase margins. We seek to differentiate ourselves by offering solutions based on our proprietary and patented designs, processes,
and applications to help our clients described in our issued and patent pending applications. We compete by offering solutions that we
believe can reduce operating expenses and increase oil yield vs currently applied technologies. 

In addition, our competitors in produced and
frac water treatment application range from local service providers to multi-national global corporations with considerable financial
resources, engineering expertise, established and proven technologies. We believe that LPN 
is a conceptually new technology that has not been introduced in the field of water treatment applications up to now. LPN 
has demonstrated exceptional results in treating produced and frac water commercially, significantly reducing the usage of hazards chemicals
during the process, meanwhile, achieving desirable water quality for industrial re-use or disposal. 

Patents 

Our Cavitation Generator patent was issued during
fiscal 2011. In addition, we have a patent for our Multi-Stage Cavitation Device Nano Reactor that was issued on October 25,
2011. In the fiscal 2014 we received approvals for another apparatus patent and 2 additional process patents in the US. As of June 30,
2021, our portfolio of patents included 19 issued patents in the United States and 12 issued patents internationally. Our patents cover
multiple process and applications of our technology in vegetable oil refining, production of biodiesel, treatment of process and industrial
water, upgrade of hydrocarbons and enhancing of alcoholic beverages. We continuously develop new technologies and applications, as we
have filed new patent applications for Low Pressure Nano-Reactors LPN . LPN 
is a highly efficient homogenizer and emulsifier that can be utilized in multiple fluids processing applications. Recently, we have filed
a patent application for a small home appliance. This new product is designed directly with consumer in mind and the first step for our
company to introduce our technology outside of the industrial sector where we typically sell our products.

Royalty Agreements 

On July 1, 2008, our wholly owned subsidiary entered
into Patent Assignment Agreements with two parties, our President as well as our former Chief Executive Officer (CEO) who currently serves
as our Technology Senior Manager, where certain devices and methods involved in our hydrodynamic cavitation processes invented by the
President and former CEO/current Technology Senior Manager have been assigned to the subsidiary. In exchange, that subsidiary
agreed to pay a royalty of 5 of gross revenues to each of the President and former CEO/current Technology Senior Manager for licensing
of the technology and leasing of the related equipment embodying the technology. These agreements were subsequently assumed by us on May
13, 2010, from our subsidiary. Our former CEO/current Technology Senior Manager and President both waived their rights to receive
royalty payments that have accrued, or that may accrue, on any gross revenue generated through June 30, 2021. 

On April 30, 2008 and as amended on November 22,
2010, our wholly owned subsidiary entered into an employment agreement with its former Director of Chemical and Analytical Department
(the Inventor to pay, in the first year, an amount equal to 5 of actual gross revenue received by us on any patent for
which the Inventor was a legally named inventor, and, in each subsequent year, 3 of actual gross revenue received by us on any such patent.
Since entering into that employment agreement, and during the term of this employment agreement, we have not received any revenue on any
patents for which the Inventor was a legally named inventor.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION
AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

The following discussion and analysis should
be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the related notes. This discussion contains forward-looking statements based
upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties, such as its plans, objectives, expectations and intentions. Its actual
results and the timing of certain events could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements. 

Overview of Our Business 

We are a Nevada corporation originally incorporated
under the name Bio Energy, Inc. On January 29, 2007, we incorporated a wholly owned subsidiary, Hydrodynamic Technology, Inc. as a California
corporation. 

We have developed, patented, and commercialized
proprietary technology that can be used for processing of various industrial and consumer-oriented fluids. Our patented Nano Reactor 
 is the critical components of the CTi Nano Neutralization System which has been shown to reduce operating costs and increase
yields in processing oils and fats. CTi holds and applied for numerous patents covering technology and various processes in US and Internationally,
covering vegetable and crude oil refining, processed and frac water treatment, algae oil extraction, and alcoholic beverage enhancement.
During our Fiscal 2021, we have continuously worked on developing additional technologies and products related to low pressure nano reactor LPN . LPN is designed
to become a highly efficient mixer and homogenizer. We believe that LPN has
a great commercial utilization opportunity by providing efficient and cost-effective solution in multiple fluid processing industries.
 LPN has a number of advantages over current mechanically operated mixers and
homogenizers. Industrial application of our technology in produced and frac water treatment system, LPN 
along with our proprietary chemical formulations have depicted measurable and quantifiable advantages over industry standard processes
and equipment. Additionally, our miniature low pressure nano reactor MLPN has become an integral part of Barmuze , a small
home appliance device for enhancing taste and extracting unwanted impurities typically present in alcoholic beverages. 

During the year ended June 30, 2021, we recorded
revenue of 558,000 and net loss of 649,000, respectively. 

12 

Management s Plan of Operation 

We are continuously engaged in manufacturing of
our Nano Reactor and Nano Neutralization Systems which are designed to help refine vegetable oils such as soybean,
canola and rapeseed. Additionally, we have developed LPN s that provide
commercial opportunity in industrial water treatment, enhancement of alcoholic beverages, and MLPN being utilized in a consumer
small home appliance. 

During the year ended June 30, 2021, we incurred
net loss of 649,000 and used cash in operating activities of 250,000. As of June 30, 2021, we have a working capital deficiency of 401,000
and a stockholders deficit of 411,000. 

Management s plan is to generate income
from operations by licensing our technology globally through Desmet Ballestra Group (Desmet), agreements with EnviroWaterTek and Alchemy
Beverages, Inc. In October 2018, we signed a three-year global R and D, Marketing and Technology License Agreement with Desmet
for the sale and licensing of our Nano Reactor and Nano Neutralization Systems . This agreement is a continuation
of the original agreement we signed with Desmet in May 2012. As part of the agreement, Desmet is also obligated to provide us with monthly
advances of 50,000 to be applied against our share in gross profit from the sale of reactors. During the year ended June 30, 2021, advances
received from Desmet amounted to 639,000, of which 104,000 was recorded as revenues. These funds service operational expenses on monthly
basis. 

Our agreement with Enviro WaterTek signed in March
of 2019, has generated sales of LPN s and recurring revenue stream in our fiscal
2021, resulting in aggregate revenue of 17,000 

There was
no revenue produced in relationship to our agreement with Alchemy Beverages, Inc. 

We anticipate that we may need additional funding,
and we may attempt to raise additional debt and/or equity financing to fund operations and to provide additional working capital. However,
there is no assurance that such financing will be consummated or obtained in sufficient amounts necessary to meet our needs, or that we
will be able to meet our future contractual obligations. Should management fail to obtain such financing, we may curtail its operations. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Revenue Recognition 

Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition
and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management
to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues
and expenses. The accounting policies and estimates described below are those we consider most critical in preparing its consolidated
financial statements. The following is a review of the accounting policies and estimates that include significant judgments made by management
using information available at the time the estimates are made. However, these estimates could change materially if different information
or assumptions were used instead. 

Note 1 of the accompanying consolidated financial
statements includes a summary of significant accounting policies, estimates, and methods used in the preparation of our financial statements.
Accounting estimates are an integral part of the preparation of financial statements and are based on judgments by management using its
knowledge and experience about the past and current events and assumptions regarding future events, all of which we consider to be reasonable.
These judgments and estimates reflect the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain and that affect the carrying value of our assets
and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent liabilities and reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period. 

13 

Revenue Recognition 

The Company follows the guidance of Accounting
Standards Codification (ASC) 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers . ASC 606 creates a five-step model that requires entities
to exercise judgment when considering the terms of contracts, which includes (1) identifying the contracts or agreements with a customer,
(2) identifying our performance obligations in the contract or agreement, (3) determining the transaction price, (4) allocating the transaction
price to the separate performance obligations, and (5) recognizing revenue as each performance obligation is satisfied. The Company only
applies the five-step model to contracts when it is probable that the Company will collect the consideration it is entitled to in exchange
for the services it transfers to its clients. 

Revenue from sale of our Nano Reactor 
and LPN is recognized when products are shipped from our manufacturing facilities
as this is our sole performance obligation under these contracts and we have no continuing obligation to the customer. 

The Company also recognizes revenue from its share
of gross profit to be earned from distributors, as defined, which we treat as variable consideration and recognize using the most likely
amount method. Estimates are available from our distributor which are considered in the determination of the most likely amount. However,
given the lack of control over the sale to the end customer and the lack of history of prior sales, the amount of gross profit revenue
recognized is limited to the actual amount of cash received under the contract which the Company has determined is not refundable and
that a significant future reversal of cumulative revenue under the contract will not occur. 

In addition, the Company also recognizes revenues
from usage fees of certain reactors. Usage fees are recognized based on actual usage by the customer. 

Leases 

The Company accounts for leases under guidance
of Accounting Standards Codification ASC 842, which requires an entity to recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability
for virtually all leases. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet. The Company accounts
for the lease and non-lease components of its office lease as a single lease component. Lease expense is recognized on a straight-line
basis over the lease term. 

Share-Based Compensation 

The Company periodically issues stock options
and warrants to employees and non-employees in non-capital raising transactions for services and for financing costs. The Company accounts
for stock option and warrant grants issued and vesting to employees based on the authoritative guidance provided by the Financial Accounting
Standards Board whereas the value of the award is measured on the date of grant and recognized over the vesting period. The Company accounts
for stock option and warrant grants issued and vesting to non- employees in accordance with the authoritative guidance of the Financial
Accounting Standards Board whereas the value of the stock compensation is based upon the measurement date as determined at either a) the
date at which a performance commitment is reached, or b) at the date at which the necessary performance to earn the equity instruments
is complete. Non-employee stock-based compensation charges generally are amortized over the vesting period on a straight-line basis. In
certain circumstances where there are no future performance requirements by the non-employee, option grants are immediately vested and
the total stock-based compensation charge is recorded in the period of the measurement date. 

The fair value of the Company's common stock options
and warrants grant is estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, which uses certain assumptions related to risk-free interest
rates, expected volatility, expected life of the common stock options, and future dividends. Compensation expense is recorded based upon
the value derived from the Black-Scholes option pricing model and based on actual experience. The assumptions used in the Black-Scholes
option pricing model could materially affect compensation expense recorded in future periods.

Revenue 

During the year ended June 30, 2021, revenue decrease
by 66 to 558,000 and it was derived from the sale of our Nano Reactor and CTi Nano Neutralization Systems to Desmet
of 345,000 pursuant to 4 purchase orders received and corresponding share in gross profit in the aggregate of 301,000. In addition,
the Company also recorded an aggregate revenue of 17,000 from the sale of LPN and water processing to Enviro Watertek,
LLC. 

During the year ended June 30, 2020, our revenue
was 1,663,000 and it was derived from the sale of our Nano Reactor and CTi Nano Neutralization Systems to Desmet of
 427,000 pursuant to 6 purchase orders received and corresponding share in gross profit in the aggregate of 266,000. The Company also
recorded an aggregate revenue of 42,000 from the sale of LPN and water processing usage fee to Enviro Watertek, LLC. In
addition, we also recorded revenue of 887,000 to account for non-refundable fees received pursuant to our agreement with GEA that expired
in December 2019. 

Operating Expenses 

Operating expenses for fiscal 2021 amounted to
 1,292,000 versus 1,487,000 in fiscal 2020, a decrease of 195,000 or 14 . The decrease in operating expenses was attributed to lower
legal fees, office and stock compensation expense compared to fiscal 2020, and amendment of certain stock warrants issued in prior period.
Non-cash expense items such as amortization and depreciation expense of 18,000, primarily amounted to a small proportion of operating
expenses, with major expense categories being salaries and payroll taxes of approximately 629,000, legal and professional fees of approximately
 126,000, for travel, insurance and marketing services combined 156,000 Research and development (R D) expense was 21,000 compared
to 18,000 the same as in the year ended June 30, 2020. 

15 

Operating expenses for fiscal 2020 amounted to
 1,487,000. Non-cash expense items such as amortization and depreciation expense of 41,000 among others, amounted to a small proportion
of operating expenses, with major expense categories being salaries and payroll taxes of approximately 699,000, legal and professional
fees of 97,000,000, travel, various insurance policies and marketing services were 167,000. 

Research and development (R D) expense during
the year ended June 30, 2021 was 21,000 compared to 18,000 during the year ended June 30, 2020. 

Net Income (Loss) 

Our reporting net loss in fiscal 2021 was 649,000
compared to net income in fiscal 2020 of 128,000. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Our cash balance at June 30, 2021 increased to
 1,363,000 compared to 759,000 at June 30, 2020. 

For the year ended June 30, 2021 cash used in
operating activities was 250,000, cash used in investing activities was 128,000, and cash generated from financing activities was 982,000. 

For the year ended June 30, 2020 cash provided
by operating activities was 56,000, cash used in investing activities was 50,000, and cash provided by financing activities was 104,000. 

During the year ended June 30, 2021, we incurred
a net loss of 649,000 and at June 30, 2021, we had a stockholder deficit of 411,000 and working capital deficiency of 401,000. These
factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern within one year of the date that the financial
statements are issued. In addition, the Company s independent registered public accounting firm, in its report on our June 30, 2021
financial statements, has raised substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The Company s
financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty be necessary should we be unable
to continue as a going concern. 

Management s plan is to generate income
from operations by continuing to license its technology globally. Additionally, we anticipate generating revenues from our agreements
with EW and ABI. 

We may also attempt to raise additional debt and/or
equity financing to fund operations and to provide additional working capital. There is no assurance that such financing will be available
in the future or obtained in sufficient amounts necessary to meet our needs, that we will be able to achieve profitable operations or
that we will be able to meet our future contractual obligations. Should management fail to obtain such financing, we may curtail its operations. 

Off-balance Sheet Arrangements 

We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that
have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on its financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations,
liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.

DATA 

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING
FIRM 

To the Stockholders and Board of Directors 
Cavitation Technologies, Inc. 
Los Angeles, CA 

Opinion on the Consolidated Financial
Statements 

We have audited the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets of Cavitation Technologies, Inc. (the Company as of June 30, 2021 and 2020, the related consolidated statements
of operations, changes in stockholders deficit, and cash flows for the years then ended, and the related notes (collectively referred
to as the consolidated financial statements ). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of the Company as of June 30, 2021 and 2020, and the results of their operations and their cash
flows for the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 

Going Concern 

The accompanying consolidated financial statements
have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 1, the Company has incurred recurring
operating losses and used cash in operations since inception. These matters raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability
to continue as a going concern. Management s plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 1 to the financial statements.
These consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

Basis for Opinion 

These consolidated financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s consolidated financial
statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United
States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities
laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We conducted our audits in accordance with the
standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated
financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we
engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding
of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s
internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our audits included performing procedures to assess
the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures
that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management,
as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for
our opinion. 

17 

Critical Audit Matter 

The critical audit matter communicated below is
a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated
to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved especially
challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion
on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing
separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. 

Estimation of variable consideration 

As described in Notes 1 and 2 to the consolidated
financial statements, the Company receives a share of the gross profit earned by one of its distributors upon such distributors sale of
products which include the Company's Nano Reactor and CTi Nano Neutralization System products. The Company's
performance obligation related to the sale of its products is completed upon the shipment of the products to the distributor. Accordingly,
at such time, the expected future share of gross profit to be earned from distributors is treated as variable consideration and recognized
as revenue using the most likely amount method, subject to variable consideration constraints. 

We identified management s estimation and
valuation of variable consideration as a critical audit matter because of the significant judgement by management in estimating the Company s
share of gross profit to be earned from distributors and the high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing audit
procedures and evaluating the reasonableness of the significant assumptions used in developing the estimate. 

Our primary audit procedures related to the estimation
of variable consideration included the following, among others: 

We evaluated the appropriateness of the Company s revenue recognition policy, including its compliance
with applicable accounting standards. 
 
 We tested the completeness, accuracy, and relevance of the underlying data used in management s estimates by testing recorded
revenues to supporting documents. 
 
 We evaluated the reasonableness of management's estimate of variable consideration in accordance with their accounting policies based
on contractual terms and historical data and variable consideration estimates, including potential variable consideration constraints. 
 
 We confirmed the Company s share of gross profit with the distributor. 

We have served as the Company s auditor
since 2013.

CAVITATION TECHNOLOGIES, INC. 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
YEARS ENDED JUNE 30, 2021 AND 2020 

Note 1 Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies 

Cavitation Technologies, Inc. the Company, CTi, we, us, 
and our is a Nevada corporation originally incorporated in January 2007 under the name Bio Energy, Inc. The Company has
developed, patented, and commercialized proprietary technology used in our Nano Reactor and LPN liquid processing
applications. 

Going Concern 

The accompanying consolidated financial statements
have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the settlement of liabilities and commitments
in the normal course of business. As reflected in accompanying consolidated financial statements, during the year ended June 30, 2021,
the Company incurred a net loss of 649,000 and at June 30, 2021 the Company had a stockholder deficit of 411,000 and working capital
deficiency of 401,000. These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going
concern. The accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that may result from an inability of the Company
to continue as a going concern. 

As of June 30, 2021, the Company has cash in the
amount of 1,363,000. The Company s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to continue to implement
its business plan. Currently, management s plan is to increase revenues by continuing to license its technology globally. While
the Company believes in the viability of its strategy to increase revenues, there can be no assurances to that effect. 

The Company may also attempt to raise additional
debt and/or equity financing to fund operations and to provide additional working capital. There is no assurance that such financing will
be available in the future or obtained in sufficient amounts necessary to meet the Company s needs, that the Company will be able
to achieve profitable operations or that the Company will be able to meet its future contractual obligations. Should management fail to
obtain such financing, the Company may curtail its operations. 

Covid-19 

During the year ended June 30, 2021, the COVID-19
pandemic did not have a material net impact on our operating results. The Company has not observed any impairments of its assets or a
significant change in the fair value of its assets due to the COVID-19 pandemic. At this time, it is not possible for the Company to predict
the duration or magnitude of the adverse results of the outbreak and its effects on the Company s business or results of operations,
financial condition, or liquidity. 

As of June 30, 2021, the Company has been following
the recommendations of local health authorities to minimize exposure risk for its employees, including having employees work remotely
and utilizing electronic submission of invoices and payments. 

23 

Principles of Consolidation 

The consolidated financial statements include
the accounts of Cavitation Technologies, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiary Hydrodynamic Technology, Inc. Intercompany transactions
and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. 

Use of Estimates 

The preparation of the consolidated financial
statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the financial statement
date, and reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Significant estimates include estimates for reserves for
inventory obsolescence, assumptions used in valuing our stock options, stock warrants and common stock issued for services and valuation
allowance for our deferred tax asset, among other items. Actual results could differ from these estimates. 

Revenue Recognition 

The Company follows the guidance of Accounting
Standards Codification (ASC) 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. ASC 606 creates a five-step model that requires entities to exercise
judgment when considering the terms of contracts, which includes (1) identifying the contracts or agreements with a customer, (2) identifying
our performance obligations in the contract or agreement, (3) determining the transaction price, (4) allocating the transaction price
to the separate performance obligations, and (5) recognizing revenue as each performance obligation is satisfied. The Company only applies
the five-step model to contracts when it is probable that the Company will collect the consideration it is entitled to in exchange for
the services it transfers to its clients. Revenue from sale of our Nano Reactors is recognized when products are shipped from our manufacturing
facilities as this is our sole performance obligation under these contracts and we have no continuing obligation to the customer. The
Company also recognizes revenue from its share of gross profit to be earned from distributors, as defined, which we treat as variable
consideration and recognize using the most likely amount method. Estimates are available from our distributor which are considered in
the determination of the most likely amount. However, given the lack of control over the sale to the end customer and the lack of history
of prior sales, the amount of gross profit revenue recognized is limited to the actual amount of cash received under the contract which
the Company has determined is not refundable and that a significant future reversal of cumulative revenue under the contract will not
occur. In addition, the Company also recognizes revenues from usage fees of certain reactors. Usage fees are recognized based on actual
usage by the customer. 

Cash and Cash Equivalents 

The Company considers highly liquid investments
with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Cash equivalents are carried at cost which approximates market
value. 

The Company maintains its cash with one domestic
financial institution. From time to time, cash balances in this domestic bank may exceed federally insured limits provided by the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corporation FDIC of up to 250,000. 

As of June 30, 2021, and 2020, Company had deposits
in excess of federally insured limit with one bank. The Company believes that no significant concentration of credit risk exists with
respect to this cash balances because of its assessment of the creditworthiness and financial viability of this financial institution. 

24 

Accounts Receivable 

Accounts receivable are generally recorded at the invoiced amounts net of an allowance for expected losses. The Company evaluates
the collectability of our trade accounts receivable based on a number of factors. In circumstances where it becomes aware of a specific
customer s inability to meet its financial obligations to us, a specific reserve for bad debts is estimated and recorded which
reduces the recognized receivable to the estimated amount that management believes will ultimately be collected. In addition to specific
customer identification of potential bad debts, bad debt charges are recorded based on our historical losses and an overall assessment
of past due trade accounts receivable outstanding. At June 30, 2021 and 2020, the Company had no reserve recorded for uncollectible accounts
receivable. 

Inventory 

Inventory is stated at the lower of cost or net
realizable value. Cost is determined on a specific item basis. Inventory is composed of finished goods and represents costs incurred to
manufacture the Company s Nano Reactor systems and LPN . 

Property and Equipment 

Property and equipment is stated
at cost. Depreciation is provided using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Betterments, renewals,
and extraordinary repairs that extend the life of the assets are capitalized; other repairs and maintenance charges are expensed as incurred.
The cost and related accumulated depreciation applicable to retired assets are removed from the Company s accounts, and the gain
or loss on dispositions, if any, is recognized in the consolidated statements of operations. 

Property and equipment are recorded at cost and
depreciated using the straight-line method over the following estimated useful lives. 

Leasehold improvements 
 
 Shorter of the life of the asset or lease term 
 
 Furniture 
 
 5-7 Years 
 
 Office equipment 
 
 5 Years 
 
 Lab equipment 
 
 4 Years 
 
 Skid systems 
 
 4 Years 

Management assesses the carrying value of property
and equipment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. If there is indication
of impairment, management prepares an estimate of future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition.
If these cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset, an impairment loss is recognized to write down the asset to its estimated
fair value. 

For the years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, the
Company did not recognize any impairment for its property and equipment. 

Income Taxes 

The Company follows the asset and liability method
of accounting for income taxes. The Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities to reflect the estimated future
tax effects, calculated at anticipated future tax rates, of future deductible or taxable amounts attributable to events that have been
recognized on a cumulative basis in the financial statements. A valuation allowance related to a deferred tax asset is recorded when it
is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted
for the effects of the changes in tax laws and rates of the date of enactment. 

25 

Leases 

The Company accounts for its leases in accordance with the guidance of FASB Accounting Standards Codification ASC 842, Leases. The Company determines whether a contract is, or contains, a lease at inception. Right-of-use assets represent the Company s
right to use an underlying asset during the lease term, and lease liabilities represent the Company s obligation to make lease
payments arising from the lease. Right-of-use assets and lease liabilities are recognized at lease commencement based upon the estimated
present value of unpaid lease payments over the lease term. The Company uses its incremental borrowing rate based on the information
available at lease commencement in determining the present value of unpaid lease payments The Company adopted ASC 842 on July 1, 2019.
There was no cumulative-effect adjustment to accumulated deficit (see Note 3). 

Fair Value Measurement 

FASB ASC 820-10 requires entities
to disclose the fair value of financial instruments, both assets and liabilities recognized and not recognized on the balance sheet for
which it is practicable to estimate fair value. ASC 820-10 defines the fair value of a financial instrument as the amount at which the
instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties. 

In addition to defining fair value, the
standard expands the disclosure requirements around fair value and establishes a fair value hierarchy for valuation inputs. The hierarchy
prioritizes the inputs into three levels based on the extent to which inputs used in measuring fair value are observable in the market.
Each fair value measurement is reported in one of the three levels which are determined by the lowest level input that is significant
to the fair value measurement in its entirety. These levels are: 

Level 1 - inputs are based upon unadjusted quoted
prices for identical instruments traded in active markets. 

Level 2 - inputs are based upon significant observable
inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not
active, and model-based valuation techniques for which all significant assumptions are observable in the market or can be corroborated
by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. 

Level 3 - inputs are generally unobservable and
typically reflect management s estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. The
fair values are therefore determined using model-based techniques that include option pricing models, discounted cash flow models, and
similar techniques. 

As of June 30, 2021, and 2020, the carrying value
of certain accounts such as accounts receivable, inventory, accounts payable, accrued expenses and accrued payroll approximates their
fair value due to the short-term nature of such instruments. 

Share-Based Compensation 

We periodically issue stock options, warrants
and common stock to employees and non-employees for services and capital raising transactions. We account for share-based payments under
the guidance of ASC 718 , which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share-based payment awards made
to employees, officers, directors, and consultants, including employee stock options, based on estimated fair values. We estimate the
fair value of stock option and warrant awards to employees and directors on the date of grant using an option-pricing model, and the value
of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense over the required service period in our Statements
of Operations. We estimate the fair value of restricted stock awards to employees and directors using the market price of our common stock
on the date of grant, and the value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense over the
required service period in our Statements of Operations. Recognition of compensation expense for non-employees is in the same period and
manner as if the Company had paid cash for the services. 

Under ASC 718, the amount of cash or other assets
transferred (or liabilities incurred) to repurchase an equity award shall be charged to equity, to the extent that the amount paid does
not exceed the fair value of the equity instruments repurchased at the repurchase date. Any excess of the repurchase price over the fair
value of the instruments repurchased shall be recognized as additional compensation cost. 

26 

Advertising Costs 

Advertising costs, including marketing expense,
incurred in the normal course of operations are expensed as incurred. Advertising expenses amounted to 12,000 and 20,000 for the years
ended June 30, 2021 and 2020 respectively and was reported as part of General and administrative expenses in the accompanying Consolidated
Statements of Operations. 

Research and Development Costs 

Research and development expenses relate primarily
to the development, design, testing of preproduction prototypes and models, compensation, and consulting fees, and are expensed as incurred.
Total research and development costs recorded during the years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020 amounted to 21,000 and 18,000, respectively. 

Warranty Policy 

The Company provides a limited warranty with every
set of reactors sold, typically 2 to 5 years. The Company has not experienced significant claims under its warranty policy, and management
determined no accrual for warranty reserve was necessary at June 30, 2021 and 2020. 

Net Income (Loss) Per Share 

The Company s computation of loss per share EPS includes basic and diluted EPS. Basic EPS is measured as the income available to common stockholders divided
by the weighted average common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted income per share reflects the potential dilution, using
the treasury stock method, that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common
stock or resulted in the issuance of common stock that then shared in the income of the Company as if they had been converted at the beginning
of the periods presented, or issuance date, if later. In computing diluted income per share, the treasury stock method assumes that outstanding
options and warrants were exercised and the proceeds are used to purchase common stock at the average market price during the period.
Options and warrants may have a dilutive effect under the treasury stock method only when the average market price of the common stock
during the period exceeds the exercise price of the options and warrants. Potential common shares that have an anti-dilutive effect (i.e.,
those that increase income per share or decrease loss per share) are excluded from the calculation of diluted EPS. 

The following table sets forth the computation
of basic and diluted loss per common share.

During the year ended June 30, 2020, we recorded
53 of our revenue from GEA Westfalia (GEA), 45 from Desmet and 2 from EW (see Note 2). 

At June 30, 2021 and 2020, 100 of accounts receivable
were due from EW and Desmet, respectively. 

Segment 

As of June 30, 2021, the Company operated one
reportable business segment. In accordance with the Segment Reporting Topic of the ASC, the Company s chief operating
decision maker has been identified as the Chief Executive Officer, who reviews operating results to make decisions about allocating resources
and assessing performance for the entire Company. Existing guidance, which is based on a management approach to segment reporting, establishes
requirements to report selected segment information quarterly and to report annually entity-wide disclosures about products and services,
major customers, and the countries in which the entity holds material assets and reports revenue. All material operating units qualify
for aggregation under Segment Reporting due to their similar customer base and similarities in: economic characteristics;
nature of products and services; and procurement, manufacturing and distribution processes. Since the Company operates in one segment,
all financial information required by Segment Reporting can be found in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements 

In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13,
Credit Losses - Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments ASC 326 ). ASU 2016-13 requires entities to use a
forward-looking approach based on current expected credit losses CECL to estimate credit losses on certain types of financial
instruments, including trade receivables. This may result in the earlier recognition of allowances for losses. ASU 2016-13 is effective
for the Company beginning January 1, 2023, and early adoption is permitted. The Company does not believe the potential impact of the new
guidance and related codification improvements will be material to its financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 

In August 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-06,
Debt Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging Contracts in Entity s Own
Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity s Own Equity. ASU 2020-06 will simplify
the accounting for convertible instruments by reducing the number of accounting models for convertible debt instruments and convertible
preferred stock. Limiting the accounting models will result in fewer embedded conversion features being separately recognized from the
host contract as compared with current GAAP. Convertible instruments that continue to be subject to separation models are (1) those with
embedded conversion features that are not clearly and closely related to the host contract, that meet the definition of a derivative,
and that do not qualify fora scope exception from derivative accounting and (2) convertible debt instruments issued with substantial premiums
for which the premiums are recorded as paid-in capital. ASU 2020-06 also amends the guidance for the derivatives scope exception for contracts
in an entity s own equity to reduce form-over-substance-based accounting conclusions. ASU 2020-06 will be effective July 1, 2024,
for the Company. Early adoption is permitted, but no earlier than July 1, 2021, including interim periods within that year. Management
is currently evaluating the effect of the adoption of ASU 2020-06 on the consolidated financial statements, but currently does not believe
ASU 2020-06 will have a significant impact on the Company. 

28 

Other recent accounting pronouncements issued
by the FASB, including its Emerging Issues Task Force, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, and the Securities and
Exchange Commission did not or are not believed by management to have a material impact on the Company s present or future consolidated
financial statements. 

Note 2 Contracts with Customers 

Desmet Ballestra Agreement 

In October 2018, we signed a three-year global
R and D, Marketing and Technology License Agreement with Desmet Ballestra (Desmet) for the sale and licensing of our reactors. This agreement
was a continuation of an original agreement we signed with Desmet in 2012 and amended in 2016. As part of the October 2018 agreement,
Desmet provided us monthly advances of 50,000 through October 1, 2021, to be applied against gross profit share from future sales. The
agreement expired on October 1, 2021, and the Company is in negotiations with Desmet for a new agreement. 

The Company recognizes revenue from sale of reactors
upon shipment and acceptance by Desmet, as the Company has no further obligations to Desmet other than the reactor s two-year standard
warranty. In accordance with ASC 606, the Company recognizes the revenue from the sale of reactors at the time of shipment of the Nano
reactor hardware as such shipment is deemed to be the Company s only performance obligation and the Company has no more continuing
obligation. Desmet pays for such reactors on credit terms and the amount of the sale is recorded as a receivable upon acceptance by Desmet. 

The Company also receives a share in gross
profit, as defined, from the sale of Desmet s integrated neutralization system to its customer of which the reactors are an
integral component. Such amount is subject to adjustment based on certain factors including costs over run. The Company has no
control with regards to the sale and installation of Nano Reactor and CTi Nano Neutralization System ,
between Desmet and the end customer. In accordance with ASC 606, the Company has determined that the gross profit to be earned from
Desmet, its distributor is variable consideration, and evaluates the amount of the potential payments and the likelihood that the
payments will be received using the most likely amount approach (subject to the variable consideration constraint). Estimates are
available from our distributor which are considered in the determination of the most likely amount. However, given the lack of
control over the sale to the end customer and the lack of history of prior sales, the Company considered these as variable revenue
constraints, and as such, the amount of revenue recognized is limited to the actual amount of cash received under the contract which
the Company has determined is not refundable and probable that a significant revenue reversal would not occur. Further, Company has
been able to develop an expectation of the actual collection based on its historical experience. 

During the year ended June 30, 2021, the Company
recorded sales of 346,000 from Nano Reactor sales and 191,000 from gross profit share for a total revenue of 537,000 from
Desmet. 

During the year ended June 30, 2020, the Company
recorded sales of 483,000 from Nano Reactor sales and 266,000 from gross profit share for a total revenue of 749,000 from
Desmet. 

As of June 30, 2021 and 2020, advances received
from Desmet related to the Company s share in gross profit amounted to 727,000 and 368,000, respectively. These advances will
only be recognized as revenues once the condition for revenue recognition have been met. 

Enviro Watertek, LLC Agreement 

In April 2019, the Company entered into a licensing
and service contract agreement with Enviro Watertek, LLC EW ). This agreement covers the Company s industrial treatment
process for produced and frack water. The Company s Low Pressure Nano Reactor LPN ),
was specifically developed to be integrated into frack water treatment system along with proprietary chemical formulations, and has depicted
measurable and quantifiable advantages over industry standard processes and equipment. The agreement with EW provides for sales on Nano
Reactors plus recurring revenue stream based on processing frack water volumes and utilization. Our agreement with EW is for a period
of 15 years but can be terminated by either party every anniversary. 

29 

During the year ended June 30, 2021 and 2020,
the Company recorded revenues of 17,000 and 38,000, respectively. Revenues from processing of frack water volumes and utilization will
only be recognized upon collection from EW. 

GEA Westfalia Agreement 

In January
2017 the Company entered into a global technology license, R D and marketing agreement with GEA Westfalia (GEA). Under the agreement,
GEA was granted a worldwide exclusive license to integrate our patented technology into water treatment application, milk and juice pasteurization,
and certain food related processes. The agreement with GEA was for three years, and provided for non-refundable payments of 300,000 per
year that were to be applied to future license fees, or the Company s share of gross profit from the sale of GEA s system
to its customers. 

From January
2017 through December 2019, the Company received total non-refundable payments of 877,000 from GEA. For the years ending June 30, 2017
through June 30, 2019, the Company accounted for these payments as customer advances as they represent deferred profit sharing revenue
in anticipation of future sales of the Company s reactors to GEA. The agreement with GEA expired in December 2019 and was not renewed.
During the term of the agreement, the Company did not sell any reactors to GEA. The Company determined that its performance
obligation to provide reactors to GEA had expired based on terms of the agreement. Accordingly, for
the year ending June 30, 2020, the Company recognized the 877,000 of non-refundable payments received in 2017 to 2019 as revenue. 

Note 3 Operating Lease 

The Company leases certain warehouse and corporate
office space under an operating lease agreement. We determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Lease assets are presented as
operating lease right-of-use assets and the related liabilities are presented as lease liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. 

Operating lease right-of-use ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. ROU assets
represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments
arising from the lease. Generally, the implicit rate of interest in lease arrangements is not readily determinable and the Company utilizes
its incremental borrowing rate in determining the present value of lease payments. The Company s incremental borrowing rate is a
hypothetical rate based on its understanding of what its credit rating would be. The operating lease ROU asset includes any lease payments
made and excludes lease incentives.

A. 
 On April 16, 2020, the Company was granted a loan for 104,000 (PPP #1)
 pursuant to the Paycheck Protection Program PPP under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (the
 Cares Act ). PPP #1 loan was scheduled to mature in April 2022 had a 1 per annum interest rate, and was
 subject to the terms and conditions applicable to loans administered by the Small Business Administration SBA under
 the CARES Act. The Company applied ASC 470, Debt, to account for PPP #1 loan. The Company used the entire PPP #1 loan
 amount for qualifying expenses as described in the CARES Act, including qualifying payroll costs, qualifying group health care
 benefits, qualifying rent, and qualifying utilities. As of June 30, 2020, the outstanding balance of PPP #1 loan was
 104,000. In May, 2021, the SBA approved the forgiveness of PPP #1 loan of 104,000, and we recognized a gain on
 extinguishment of PPP #1 loan of 104,000 during the year ended June 30, 2021. 

B. 
 On March 26, 2021, the Company received a second loan of 104,000 pursuant

470, Debt, to account for PPP #2 loan. Funds from PPP #2 loan may only be used for qualifying expenses
as described in the CARES Act, including qualifying payroll costs, qualifying group health care benefits, qualifying rent and debt obligations,
and qualifying utilities. The Company believes it used the entire loan amount for qualifying expenses. Under the terms of
the PPP, certain amounts of the loan may be forgiven if they are used for qualifying expenses. The Company is currently
in the process of applying for forgiveness of the PPP #2 loan with respect to these qualifying expenses, however, the Company cannot
assure that such forgiveness of any portion of PPP #2 loan will occur. The Company was in compliance
with the terms of PPP #2 loan as of June 30, 2021. As of June 30, 2021, the outstanding balance of PPP #2 loan was
 104,000.

The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S.
Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of measurement corresponding with the expected term of the award; the contractual term represents
the weighted-average period of time the awards granted are expected to be outstanding giving consideration to vesting schedules, contractual
terms, and historical participant exercise behavior; the expected volatility is based upon historical volatility of the Company s
Common Stock; and the expected dividend yield is based on the fact that the Company has not paid dividends in the past and does not expect
to pay dividends in the future. 

Note 8 - Income Taxes 

For the year ended June 30, 2021, the Company
recorded no provision for income taxes due to the Company s taxable net loss position. For the year ended June 30, 2020, the Company
recorded no provision for income taxes due to available Federal net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards that are available to reduce taxable
income. 

Deferred income taxes result from temporary differences
in the recognition of income and expenses for the financial reporting purposes and for tax purposes. The components of deferred tax assets
are presented below. 

At June 30, 2021, the Company had available Federal NOL carryforwards of approximately 9.8 million
that are available to reduce future taxable income. The Federal NOL carry forward expires through 2036. The NOLs are subject to statutory
limitations under Internal Revenue Code Section 382 regarding substantial changes in ownership of companies with loss carry forwards. 

During the year ended June 30, 2021 and 2020,
management has determined that it is more likely than not that the Company will not be able to realize the tax benefit of the carryforwards
due to recurring operating losses. Based on their valuation, the Company determined that the net deferred tax assets, do not meet the
requirements to realize, and as such, the Company has provided a full valuation allowance against them. 

At June 30, 2021 and 2020, significant component of the Company s
deferred tax assets and liabilities are as follows:

Accounting rules prescribes a recognition threshold
that a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements and provides guidance on recognition, measurement,
classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition issues. The Company classifies interest
and penalties as a component of interest and other expenses. To date, there have been no interest or penalties assessed or paid. 

The Company measures and records uncertain tax
positions by establishing a threshold for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be
taken in a tax return. Only tax positions meeting the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold at the effective date may
be recognized or continue to be recognized.

Note 9 Commitments and Contingencies 

Royalty Agreements 

On July 1, 2008, the Company s wholly owned
subsidiary entered into Patent Assignment Agreements with two parties, its President as well as its former Chief Executive Officer (CEO)
and current Technology Senior Manager, where certain devices and methods involved in the hydrodynamic cavitation processes invented by
the President and former CEO/ current Technology Senior Manager have been assigned to the Company. In exchange, the Company
agreed to pay a royalty of 5 of gross revenues to each of the President and former CEO/ current Technology Senior Manager for licensing
of the technology and leasing of the related equipment embodying the technology. These agreements were subsequently assigned to Cavitation
Technologies on May 13, 2010. The Company s former CEO/ current Technology Senior Manager and President both waived their rights
to receive royalty payments that have accrued, or that may accrue, on any gross revenue generated through June 30, 2021 and 2020. 

On April 30, 2008 (as amended November 22, 2010),
the Company s wholly owned subsidiary entered into an employment agreement with the Director of Chemical and Analytical Department

royalty stream in the first year in which the Company receives royalty payments from the patent which the Inventor was the legally named
inventor, and 3 of actual gross royalties received by the Company resulting from the patent in each subsequent year. As of June 30, 2021,
and 2020 no patents have been granted in which this person is the legally named inventor. 

Note 10 Subsequent Events 

Subsequent to June 30, 2021, the Company issued
12,071,785 shares of common stock and 12,071,785 fully vested warrants to purchase common stock over a period of five years with an exercise
price of 0.09 per share in exchange for net cash proceeds of 785,000 or a selling price of 0.065 per share. 

Subsequent to June 30, 2021, the SBA forgave the
Company s PPP #2 loan payable of 104,000 obtained in March 2021. The Company will account for the forgiven loan as a gain on forgiveness
of debt.

ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

In accordance with rule 13a-15(a), our management
must maintain disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, or the Exchange
Act, to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange
Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission rules
and forms, and accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer,
as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

In accordance with Rule 13a-15(b) and (c), management
must also evaluate the effectiveness of these disclosure control and procedures at the end of each fiscal year. As of June 30, 2021, we
carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial
officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based upon that evaluation, our principal
executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that these disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of June
30, 2021. 

Report of Management on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

Management is responsible for establishing and
maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Our internal control
over financial reporting is designed under the supervision of our principal executive and principal financial officer, and effected by
our board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes
those policies and procedures that: 

(i) pertain to the maintenance of records that,
in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; 

(ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that our receipts and expenditures
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and 

(iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention
or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial
statements. 

Under the supervision and with the participation
of our management, including our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness
of our internal controls and procedures, (as defined under Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act)) as of the year ended June 30, 2021. Management conducted as assessment of our internal control
over financial reporting based on the framework and criteria established by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission COSO in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013). Our management concluded that as of June 30, 2021, our
internal control over financial reporting was not effective, and that material weaknesses existed in the following areas as of June 30,
2020: 

1. We do not employ full time in-house personnel with the technical knowledge to identify and address some
of the reporting issues surrounding certain complex or non-routine transactions. With respect to material, complex and non-routine transactions,
management has and will continue to seek guidance from third-party experts and/or consultants to gain a thorough understanding of these
transactions; 

2. We have ineffective controls over segregation of duties due to limited resources and number of employees. 

37 

We are in the continuous process of improving
our internal control over financial reporting in an effort to eliminate these material weaknesses through improved supervision and training
of our staff, but additional effort is needed to fully remedy these deficiencies. We intend to hire the necessary staff to address the
weaknesses once additional capital is obtained which will allow full operations to commence. Because of its inherent limitations, internal
control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can
provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial
Reporting 

There have been no changes in our internal control
over financial reporting during the year ended June 30, 2021 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect,
our internal control over financial reporting. 

Attestation 

Pursuant to Item 308(b) of Regulation S-K, as
amended by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Wall Street Reform Act), this report does not include an attestation
report of the Company s registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. The Wall Street Reform
Act permanently exempts small public companies from the requirement to obtain an external audit on the effectiveness of internal financial
reporting controls.

Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance 

Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended, requires our executive officers, directors, persons who own more than 10 of our common stock, and immediate family
members living in the same household to file an Initial Statement of Beneficial Ownership on Form 3 and changes in ownership on Form 4
with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC ). Such insiders are required by SEC rules to furnish us with
copies of all Section 16(a) forms they file. 

Based on a review of Forms 3, 4, and 5 and amendments
thereto furnished to us during fiscal 2020 updated forms were filed, ended June 30, 2021, there were no delinquent forms filed during
the year. 

Director Independence 

Although our common stock is not listed on a national
securities exchange, for purposes of independence we use the definition of independence applied by the NASDAQ stock market. The Board
has determined that Mr. Fuller is an independent in accordance with such definition. Mr. Gorodnitsky is not independent
due to his current positions with the Company. 

Code of Ethics 

We have adopted a Code of Business Conduct and
Ethics that applies to all officers, directors and employees. A copy may also be obtained free of charge by mailing a request in writing
to: Cavitation Technologies, Inc., 10019 Canoga Ave., Chatsworth, CA 91311 USA. If we make any substantive amendments to the Code of Business
Conduct and Ethics or grant any waiver from a provision of the Code to any executive officer or director, we will promptly disclose the
nature of the amendment or waiver in a current report on Form 8-K.

The fair value of each option grant is estimated
at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. Expected volatility is calculated based on the historical volatility
of the Company s stock. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield for a term equal to the expected life of
the options at the time of grant. 

Employment Agreements 

Our executive officers work as at-will employees. 

Code Section 162(m) Provisions 

Section 162(m) of the U.S. Internal Revenue
Code, or the Code, generally disallows a tax deduction to public companies for compensation in excess of 1 million paid to the Chief
Executive Officer or any of the four most highly compensated officers. Performance-based compensation arrangements may qualify for an
exemption from the deduction limit if they satisfy various requirements under Section 162(m). Although we consider the impact of
this rule when developing and implementing our executive compensation programs, we believe it is important to preserve flexibility in
designing compensation programs. Accordingly, we have not adopted a policy that all compensation must qualify as deductible under Section 162(m)
of the Code. While our stock options are intended to qualify as performance-based compensation (as defined by the Code),
amounts paid under our other compensation programs may not qualify as such.

ITEM 12. Security Ownership of Certain
Beneficial Owners and Management 

The following table provides information regarding
the beneficial ownership of our common stock as of October 5, 2020, (the Evaluation Date by: (i) each of our current
directors, (ii) each of our named executive officers, and (iii) all such directors and executive officers as a group. We know
of no other person or group of affiliated persons who beneficially own more than five percent of our common stock. The table is based
upon information supplied by our officers, directors and principal stockholders and a review of Schedules 13D and 13G, if any, filed with
the SEC. Unless otherwise indicated in the footnotes to the table and subject to community property laws where applicable, we believe
that each of the stockholders named in the table has sole voting and investment power with respect to the shares indicated as beneficially
owned. 

Applicable percentages are based on 196,997,906
shares outstanding as of the Evaluation Date, adjusted as required by rules promulgated by the SEC. These rules generally attribute beneficial
ownership of securities to persons who possess sole or shared voting power or investment power with respect to those securities. In addition,
the rules include shares of our common stock issuable pursuant to the exercise of stock options or warrants that are either immediately
exercisable or exercisable within 60 days of the Evaluation Date. These shares are deemed to be outstanding and beneficially owned by
the person holding those options for the purpose of computing the percentage ownership of that person, but they are not treated as outstanding
for the purpose of computing the percentage ownership of any other person.

ITEM 13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions 

Certain Related Party Transactions 

Since the beginning of our last fiscal year ,
there has not been, and there is not currently proposed, any transaction or series of similar transactions to which we were or will be
a party in which the amount involved exceeded or will exceed the lesser of 120,000 or one percent of the average of our total assets
at year-end for the last two completed fiscal years and in which any of our directors, executive officers, holders of more than five percent
of any class of our voting securities or any member of the immediate family of the foregoing persons had or will have a direct or indirect
material interest. 

Accrued Payroll and Payroll Taxes 

As of June 30, 2021, and 2020, the Company had
accrued unpaid salaries to officers and former officers amounting to 667,000 and 693,000 respectively. 

Cameo USA LLC 

In fiscal 2014, Roman Gordon, one of the Company s
shareholders and a former officer, formed a company called Cameo USA LLC (Cameo). Since its formation, Cameo has had no revenue, no operations,
and has had no assets or liabilities. On June 4, 2018, Mr. Gordon contributed his 100 interest in Cameo to the Company. As Mr. Gordon
had no basis in his investment in Cameo, there was no value assigned to the contribution of Cameo. Subsequent to the contribution of Cameo
to the Company, Cameo was sold to Alchemy Beverages Inc. 

43 

Director Independence 

As our common stock is currently traded on the
OTC Bulletin Board, we are not subject to the rules of any national securities exchange which require that a majority of a listed company's
directors and specified committees of the board of directors meet independence standards prescribed by such rules. For the purpose of
preparing the disclosures in this Report on Form 10-K regarding director independence, we have used the definition of independent
director set forth in the Marketplace Rules of The NASDAQ, which defines an independent director generally as a person
other than an executive officer or employee of the Company or any other individual having a relationship which, in the opinion of the
Company's board of directors, would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director.
Consistent with these standards, we believe that James Fuller is an Independent Financial Expert. 

ITEM 14. Principal Accounting Fees and Services 

Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm s Fee Summary 

The following table provides information regarding

(2) 
 The audit related fees were for professional services rendered for additional filing for registration statements and forms with the SEC. 

Pre-Approval Policies and Procedures 

Consistent with SEC policies regarding auditor
independence, the Audit Committee has responsibility for appointing, setting compensation and overseeing the work of the independent registered
public accounting firm. In recognition of this responsibility, the Audit Committee has established a policy to pre-approve all audit and
permissible non-audit services provided by the independent registered public accounting firm. 

Prior to the engagement of the independent registered
public accounting firm for the next year s audit, management will submit a list of services and related fees expected to be rendered
during that year for audit services, audit-related services, tax services and other fees to the Audit Committee for approval.
