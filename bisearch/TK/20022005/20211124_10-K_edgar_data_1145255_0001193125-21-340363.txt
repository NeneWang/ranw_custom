BUSINESS 

GENERAL 

Hennessy Advisors, Inc. (the Company, we, us, or our is a publicly traded investment management firm whose primary business activity is managing, servicing, and marketing a family of open-end
 mutual funds branded as the Hennessy Funds. We are committed to providing superior service to investors and employing a consistent and disciplined approach to investing based on a buy-and-hold

 philosophy that rejects the idea of market timing. Our goal is to provide products that investors can have confidence in, knowing their money is invested as promised and with their best interests in mind. Our firm was founded on these principles over 30 years ago, and the same principles guide us today. 
 We earn revenues primarily by providing investment advisory services to the Hennessy Funds and secondarily by providing shareholder services to shareholders of the Hennessy Funds. Investment advisory services include managing the composition of each fund s portfolio (including the purchase, retention, and disposition of portfolio securities in accordance with each fund s investment objectives, policies, and restrictions), monitoring each fund s compliance with its investment restrictions and federal securities laws, monitoring the liquidity of each fund, reviewing each fund s investment performance, overseeing the selection and continued employment of sub-advisors
 and monitoring such sub-advisors 
 adherence to the fund s investment objectives, policies, and restrictions, monitoring and overseeing other service providers, maintaining in-house
 marketing and distribution departments, preparing and distributing regulatory reports, and monitoring and overseeing distribution through third-party financial intermediaries. Shareholder services include maintaining a toll-free
 number that the current investors in the Hennessy Funds may call to ask questions about their accounts or the funds or to get help with processing exchange and redemption requests or changing account options. The fees we receive for investment advisory and shareholder services are calculated as a percentage of the average daily net asset values of the Hennessy Funds. Accordingly, our total revenue increases or decreases as our average assets under management rises or falls. The percentage amount of the investment advisory fees varies from fund to fund, but the percentage amount of the shareholder service fees is consistent across all funds. 
 We have delegated the day-to-day

 portfolio management responsibilities to sub-advisors,
 subject to our oversight, for some of the Hennessy Funds. In exchange for these sub-advisory
 services, we pay each sub-advisor
 a fee out of our own assets, which is calculated as a percentage of the average daily net asset values of the sub-advised
 funds. Accordingly, the sub-advisory
 fees we pay increase or decrease as our average assets under management in our sub-advised
 funds increases or decreases, respectively. 
 Our average assets under management for fiscal year 2021 was 4.0 billion, and our total assets under management as of the end of fiscal year 2021 was 4.1 billion. Although our total AUM has fluctuated up and down throughout our history, it was 984 higher as of the end of fiscal year 2021 than our total AUM of 375 million as of the end of fiscal year 2002, which was our first fiscal year as a public company. 

 Our business strategy centers on (i) organic growth through our marketing, sales, and distribution efforts and (ii) growth through strategic purchases of management-related
 assets.

Following is a brief description of the investment objectives and principal investment strategies of the Hennessy Funds in the Domestic Equity product category: 

Hennessy Cornerstone Growth Fund

 (Investor Class symbol HFCGX; Institutional Class symbol HICGX). The Hennessy Cornerstone Growth Fund seeks long-term growth of capital by investing in growth-oriented common stocks using a quantitative formula. From the investable common stocks of public companies in the S P Capital IQ Database with market capitalizations exceeding 175 million, this fund invests in the 50 common stocks with the highest one-year
 price appreciation that also have price-to-sales

 ratios below 1.5, higher annual earnings than in the previous year, and positive stock price appreciation over the prior three-month and six-month
 periods. 

Hennessy Focus Fund

 (Investor Class symbol HFCSX; Institutional Class symbol HFCIX). The Hennessy Focus Fund seeks capital appreciation by focusing on approximately 20 companies whose valuations in the market are modest, that earn higher than average economic returns, that are well managed, and that have ample opportunity to reinvest excess profits at above-average
 rates. This fund s holdings are conviction-weighted. 

Hennessy Cornerstone Mid Cap 30 Fund

 (Investor Class symbol HFMDX; Institutional Class symbol HIMDX). The Hennessy Cornerstone Mid Cap 30 Fund seeks long-term growth of capital by investing in mid-cap
 growth-oriented
 common stocks using a quantitative formula. From the investable common stocks of public companies in the S P Capital IQ Database with market capitalizations between 1 billion and 10 billion, this fund invests in the 30 common stocks with the highest one-year

Hennessy Cornerstone Large Growth Fund

 (Investor Class symbol HFLGX; Institutional Class symbol HILGX).

From the investable common stocks of public companies in the S P Capital IQ Database, this fund invests in the 50 stocks that meet the following criteria, in the specified order: (1) above-average market capitalization; (2) a price-to-cash-flow

ratio less than the median of the remaining securities; (3) positive total capital; and (4) the highest one-year
 return on total capital. 

Hennessy Cornerstone Value Fund

 (Investor Class symbol HFCVX; Institutional Class symbol HICVX). The Hennessy Cornerstone Value Fund seeks total return, consisting of capital appreciation and current income, by investing in larger, dividend-paying common stocks using a quantitative formula.

 market capitalizations, above-average
 number of shares outstanding, 12-month
 sales that are 50 greater than the average, and above-average
 cash flows. 
 
 Multi-Asset Funds
 
 Three of the Hennessy Funds are categorized as Multi-Asset products. Of those three funds, two utilize a quantitative investment strategy and one is actively managed. These funds follow a more conservative investment strategy focused on generating income and providing an alternative to mutual funds containing only equity stocks. Following is a brief description of the investment objectives and principal investment strategies of the Hennessy Funds in the Multi-Asset
 product category: 

Hennessy Total Return Fund

 (Investor Class symbol HDOGX). The Hennessy Total Return Fund seeks total return, consisting of capital appreciation and current income, by investing approximately 50 of its assets in the 10 highest dividend-yielding common stocks of the Dow Jones Industrial Average (known as the Dogs of the Dow in roughly equal dollar amounts and the remaining 50 of its assets in U.S. Treasury securities with a maturity of less than one year. This fund then utilizes a borrowing strategy that allows the fund s performance to approximate what it would be if the fund had an asset allocation of roughly 75 Dogs of the Dow stocks and 25 U.S. Treasury securities. 

Hennessy Equity and Income Fund

 (Investor Class symbol HEIFX; Institutional Class symbol HEIIX). The Hennessy Equity and Income Fund seeks income and long-term capital appreciation with reduced volatility of returns by investing up to 70 of its assets in common stock, preferred stock, and convertible securities and its remaining assets in high-quality
 corporate, agency, and government bonds. 

Hennessy Balanced

 Fund 

(Investor Class symbol HBFBX). The Hennessy Balanced Fund seeks a combination of capital appreciation and current income by investing approximately 50 of its assets in roughly equal dollar amounts in the Dogs of the Dow stocks but limits exposure to market risk and volatility by investing approximately 50 of its assets in U.S. Treasury securities with a maturity of less than one year. 
 
 Sector and Specialty Funds
 
 Eight of the Hennessy Funds are categorized as Sector and Specialty products. Of those eight funds, one is designed as an index fund and the other seven are actively managed, and each focuses on a niche sector of the stock market. Following is a brief description of the investment objectives and principal investment strategies of the Hennessy Funds in the Sector and Specialty product category: 

Hennessy BP Energy Transition Fund 

(Investor Class symbol HNRGX; Institutional Class symbol HNRIX). The Hennessy BP Energy Transition Fund seeks total return by investing in companies operating in the United States in a capacity related to the supply, transportation, production, transmission, or demand of energy, also known as the energy value chain.

The portfolio managers combine a top-down
 deductive reasoning approach with a detailed bottom-up
 analysis of individual companies. 

Hennessy Gas Utility Fund

Hennessy Japan Fund

 (Investor Class symbol HJPNX; Institutional Class symbol HJPIX). The Hennessy Japan Fund seeks long-term capital appreciation by investing in equity securities of Japanese companies. Using in-depth
 analysis and on-site
 research, the portfolio managers focus on stocks with a potential value gap by screening for companies that they believe have strong businesses and management and are trading at attractive prices. The portfolio managers limit the portfolio to what they consider to be their best ideas and maintain a concentrated number of holdings. 

Hennessy Japan Small Cap Fund

 (Investor Class symbol HJPSX; Institutional Class symbol HJSIX). The Hennessy Japan Small Cap Fund seeks long-term capital appreciation by investing in equity securities of smaller Japanese companies, typically considered to be companies with market capitalizations in the bottom 20 of all publicly traded Japanese companies. Using in-depth
 analysis and on-site
 research, the portfolio managers focus on stocks with a potential value gap by screening for small-cap
 companies that the portfolio managers believe have strong businesses and management and are trading at attractive prices. The portfolio managers limit the portfolio to what they consider to be their best ideas and is unconstrained by its benchmarks. 

Hennessy Large Cap Financial Fund

 Development of New Investment Strategies and Expanding Our Product Offerings 

We develop new investment strategies and expand our product offerings by identifying client needs and reviewing asset allocation tables to determine where we can augment our family of mutual funds. Once we identify an attractive market segment, we select one of the following methods to initiate the new strategy: 

We screen the appropriate universe of stocks with a set of parameters that we believe identifies stocks that will produce higher long-term returns with lower associated risk than their relative indices, and we then introduce the new investment strategy into the marketplace by opening and directly marketing a new mutual fund; 

We purchase the assets related to the management of an existing mutual fund that we then manage ourselves; 

We purchase the assets related to the management of an existing mutual fund and then engage the existing portfolio managers or strategic firm to act as a sub-advisor
 to manage the fund; or 

We purchase the assets related to the management of an existing mutual fund and then employ the existing portfolio management team to manage the fund. 

ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT, SOURCES OF REVENUES, AND 12B-1
 PLANS 

 We earn revenues primarily by providing investment advisory services to the Hennessy Funds and secondarily by providing shareholder services to shareholders of the Hennessy Funds. The fees we receive for these services are calculated as a percentage of the average daily net asset values of the Hennessy Funds. In addition, the sub-advisory
 fees that we pay are also calculated as a percentage of the average daily net asset values of the sub-advised
 Hennessy Funds. The amount of our assets under management fluctuates as a result of organic inflows (purchases of shares of the Hennessy Funds by new or existing shareholders), acquisition inflows, outflows (redemptions of shares of the Hennessy Funds by shareholders), and market appreciation or depreciation.

The investment advisory agreements also provide that we are responsible for performing any ordinary clerical and bookkeeping services needed by the Hennessy Funds that are not provided by the funds custodian, administrator, or transfer agent. The Funds Board of Trustees comprises three trustees who are not interested persons of the Hennessy Funds (the disinterested trustees and Neil J.

 In exchange for the services described above, we receive an investment advisory fee from each Hennessy Fund that is calculated as a percentage of such fund s average daily net asset value. As of the end of fiscal year 2021, the percentages of each fund s assets used to calculate the annual investment advisory fees payable to us are as follows:

 We waived a portion of our fees with respect to the Hennessy Cornerstone Large Growth Fund and the Hennessy BP Energy Transition Fund through the expiration of each fund s expense limitation agreement on November 30, 2019, and October 25, 2020, respectively. We continue to waive a portion of its fees with respect to the Hennessy BP Midstream Fund and the Hennessy Technology Fund to comply with contractual expense ratio limitations. The fee waivers are calculated daily by the Hennessy Funds accountants at U.S. Bank Global Fund Services, reviewed by management, and then charged to expense monthly as offsets to our revenues. Each waived fee is then deducted from investment advisory fee income and reduces the aggregate amount of advisory fees we receive from such fund in the subsequent month. Total fee waivers during fiscal years 2021 and 2020 were 0.1 million and 0.3 million, respectively. To date, we have only waived fees based on contractual obligations, but we have the ability to waive fees at our discretion. Any decision to waive fees would apply only on a going-forward
 basis. 
 Our investment advisory agreements must be renewed annually (except in limited circumstances) by (a) the Funds Board of Trustees or the vote of a majority of the outstanding shares of the applicable Hennessy Fund and (b) the vote of a majority of the disinterested trustees. If an investment advisory agreement is not renewed, it terminates automatically. There are two additional circumstances in which an investment advisory agreement would terminate. First, an investment advisory agreement automatically terminates if we assign it to another advisor (assignment includes indirect assignment, which is the transfer of our common stock in sufficient quantities deemed to constitute a controlling block). Second, an investment advisory agreement may be terminated prior to its expiration upon 60 days written notice by either the applicable Hennessy Fund or us.

 Shareholder Servicing Agreements and Fees 

Pursuant to a shareholder servicing agreement with Hennessy Funds Trust, we provide shareholder services to shareholders of the Hennessy Funds including, among other things, maintaining a toll-free
 number that the current investors in the Hennessy Funds may call to ask questions about their accounts or the funds or to get help with processing exchange and redemption requests or changing account options. In exchange for these services, we receive a shareholder service fee from each Hennessy Fund of 0.10 of the average daily net assets of such fund s Investor Class shares. 
 The shareholder servicing agreement must be renewed annually by the Funds Board of Trustees, including the vote of a majority of the disinterested trustees. If the shareholder servicing agreement is not renewed, it terminates automatically. In addition, the shareholder servicing agreement may be terminated prior to its expiration upon 60 days written notice by Hennessy Funds Trust or us. 

 12b-1
 Plans 

All of the Hennessy Funds have adopted a 12b-1
 plan. These plans are named after Rule 12b-1
 of the Investment Company Act of 1940, which permits a mutual fund to adopt a plan that allows the fund to collect fees to use to make payments to third parties in connection with the distribution of fund shares. Amounts paid under a plan may be spent on any activities or expenses primarily intended to result in sale of shares of the fund, including, but not limited to (i) advertising, (ii) compensation paid to financial institutions, broker-dealers, and others for sales and marketing, (iii) shareholder accounting servicing, (iv) printing and mailing prospectuses to possible new shareholders, and (v) printing and mailing sales literature. A mutual fund may also employ a distributor to distribute and market fund shares and then use 12b-1
 fees to pay the distributor for expenses relating to telephone use, overhead, employing employees who engage in or support the distribution of the fund shares, printing prospectuses and other reports for possible new shareholders, advertising, and preparing and distributing sales literature. 
 The 12b-1
 fee for each Hennessy Fund is 0.15 of the average daily net assets of such fund s Investor Class shares.

 CUSTODIAL, DISTRIBUTION, AND BROKERAGE ARRANGEMENTS 

We use independent third parties for custody and distribution of our assets under management. 

 All trades for the Hennessy Funds are executed by independent brokerage firms following our direction or the direction of our sub-advisors.
 When selecting brokers, we and our sub-advisors
 are required to seek best execution. Although there is no single statutory definition, Securities and Exchange Commission SEC releases and other legal guidelines make clear that this duty requires us to seek the most advantageous terms reasonably available under the circumstances for a customer s account. The lowest possible commission, while important, is not the sole determinative factor. We and our sub-advisors
 also consider factors such as order size and market depth, availability of competing markets and liquidity, trading characteristics of the security, financial responsibility of the broker-dealer,
 and the broker s ability to address current market conditions. 
 Currently, we participate in soft dollar arrangements with one of our brokers. This means we receive research reports and real-time electronic research to assist us in trading and managing the Hennessy Funds. Under these soft dollar arrangements, the Hennessy Funds pay brokerage commissions for securities trades at the regular market rate, and some or all of the value of those commissions is received by us in the form of research or other services that benefit the Hennessy Funds. We believe our soft dollar arrangements comply with SEC guidance regarding soft dollars.

 BUSINESS STRATEGY 

From the time we launched our first mutual fund in 1996, we have consistently pursued a growth strategy centered on organic growth through our marketing, sales, and distribution efforts and growth through strategic purchases of management-related
 assets. The implementation of this business strategy is described below. 

Seeking to deliver strong investment performance of the Hennessy Funds 

One of the most effective ways we can grow the assets of the Hennessy Funds is by delivering strong investment performance, which we believe should: 

result in an increase in the value of existing assets of the Hennessy Funds; 

encourage more investors to buy shares of the Hennessy Funds and decrease the number of investors who redeem their shares and leave the Hennessy Funds; and 

16 

Table of Contents 

motivate current investors to invest additional money in the Hennessy Funds. 

Utilizing our branding and marketing campaign to attract assets 

We believe we can attract investors to the Hennessy Funds by effectively marketing our consistent and disciplined approach to investing based on a buy-and-hold

 philosophy that rejects the idea of market timing. We offer quantitative funds, actively managed funds, and income-generating funds. We believe our quantitative funds attract investors who want to understand exactly how their investments are managed and who favor statistical analysis and empirical evidence as the basis for investment decisions. We also believe that our actively managed funds attract investors who appreciate a fundamental, hands-on
 investment management approach and talented portfolio managers. Finally, we believe our more conservative, income-generating
 funds attract investors seeking alternatives to mutual funds invested entirely in equities. 
 We run a comprehensive and far-reaching
 public relations program designed to disseminate our message to a wide variety of potential investors through frequent television appearances, radio spots, feature articles, and print media mentions. We have partnered with an industry-leading public relations firm, SunStar Strategic, to proactively promote the Hennessy Funds to national financial media. This public relations program has consistently resulted in the Hennessy Funds being mentioned an average of once every two to three days in national print and broadcast media such as CNBC, Fox News, Bloomberg radio and TV, The Wall Street Journal, Kiplinger, and Barron s, among others. To facilitate our presence in the media, we utilize LiveStudio, an in-house
 studio providing a direct link to media broadcasts, at our office in Novato, California. We have several spokespeople who help us expand our public relations program and provide comprehensive media coverage of our products, including (i) Neil J. Hennessy, who is our Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of our Board of Directors as well as President, Chief Market Strategist, and a Portfolio Manager of the Hennessy Funds, (ii) Ryan Kelley, Chief Investment Officer and a Portfolio Manager of the Hennessy Funds, and (iii) Portfolio Managers David Ellison and Josh Wein, as well as the Portfolio Managers at our sub-advisors.
 
 We maintain and regularly update a robust website and social media presence. Our core marketing efforts include targeted outreach to both current and prospective investors in the Hennessy Funds, including financial advisors and retail investors. Our content marketing includes overall market and sector-specific
 thought leadership, promotional investment ideas, fund updates, and commentary from our portfolio managers, as well as feature news articles and broadcast appearances. We attend select investment advisor trade shows and strategic industry-related
 conferences, and we seek opportunities to moderate or speak on industry-related panels. Through much of our fiscal year 2021 and the second half of our fiscal year 2020, we participated in these activities via videoconference or teleconference, as necessary. 

Expanding our distribution network to additional distribution platforms 

Investors may purchase shares of the Hennessy Funds through financial intermediaries, including mutual fund supermarkets, national wirehouses and broker-dealers,
 independent and regional broker-dealers, and registered investment advisors, or directly from the Hennessy Funds. 
 Mutual fund supermarkets, such as Schwab, Fidelity, TD Ameritrade, and Pershing, generally offer funds of many different investment companies to investors in exchange for a services fee paid by the applicable fund or that fund s investment advisor. The ability to purchase various mutual funds in a single location is very attractive to investors, and the majority of our 3.6 billion of assets under management as of the end of fiscal year 2021 was held at mutual fund supermarkets. Additionally, we continually seek opportunities to form new relationships with financial intermediaries to make our no-load
 mutual funds even more accessible to investors. We oversee distribution of the Hennessy Funds through all financial intermediaries. 
 Investors may also purchase shares of the Hennessy Funds directly through the Hennessy Funds website or by calling us or U.S. Bank Global Fund Services, the Hennessy Funds administrator.

Increasing our current base of financial advisors and investment professionals 

Investment professionals generally have access to a wide variety of investment products they may recommend to their investors. A recommendation by an investment professional to an investor to buy one of the Hennessy Funds may greatly influence that investor. Thus, we believe that expanding our current base of investment professionals who utilize no-load
 funds for their investors will help us increase our assets under management, which will in turn increase our revenues. 

Securing participation on the platforms of national full-service firms 

We continually strive to develop relationships with national full-service firms that permit their investment professionals to offer no-load
 funds to their investors as a way to increase the amount of assets that we manage, which will in turn increase our revenues. 

Pursuing strategic purchases of management agreements for additional mutual funds 

A primary component of our growth strategy is to selectively pursue strategic purchases of the assets related to the management of additional mutual funds. We believe the regulatory burden imposed upon the mutual fund industry, along with increased competition, has compressed the margins of smaller to mid-sized
 mutual fund managers, making those managers more receptive to an asset purchase. The long-term
 trend toward lower fees has made it more challenging to identify accretive asset purchases, but we believe that we are well positioned to move quickly once we identify any attractive purchase targets from the increasingly large supply of potential targets. 
 Through our asset purchase strategy, we have completed 10 purchases of the assets related to the management of mutual funds over a 20-year
 period, integrating 4.3 billion in net assets of 30 different mutual funds into the Hennessy Funds family. We completed our most recent asset purchase on October 26, 2018, when we purchased the assets related to the management of the BP Capital TwinLine Energy Fund and the BP Capital TwinLine MLP Fund (together, the BP Funds ), which were reorganized into the Hennessy BP Energy Transition Fund and the Hennessy BP Midstream Fund, respectively, two new series of Hennessy Funds Trust. 

Delivering strong, high-quality
 financial results. 

We seek to maintain a strong financial position and to manage our investment advisory business to meet the highest regulatory, ethical, and business standards and to maintain continuity of service to all of the investors in the Hennessy Funds. 

 COMPETITION 

The investment advisory industry is highly competitive, with new competitors continually entering the industry. We compete directly with numerous global and U.S. investment managers, commercial banks, savings and loans associations, brokerage and investment banking firms, broker-dealers, insurance companies, and other financial institutions that often provide investment products with similar features and objectives to those we offer. These institutions range from small boutique firms to large financial services complexes. We are considered a small investment advisory company. Many competing companies are part of larger financial services companies that conduct business in more markets and have greater marketing, financial, technical, research, and distribution resources and other capabilities than we do. Most of the larger firms offer a broader range of financial services to the same retail and institutional investors we seek to serve. These factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage, and we can give no assurance that our strategies and efforts to maintain and enhance our current investor relationships, as well as to create new ones, will be successful. To grow our business, we must be able to compete effectively for assets under management. Key competitive factors include: 

the investment performance of the Hennessy Funds; 

the expense ratios of the Hennessy Funds; 

the array of our product offerings; 

18 

Table of Contents 

industry rankings of the Hennessy Funds; 

the quality of our services; 

our ability to further develop and market our brand; 

our commitment to placing the interests of investors first; and 

our general business reputation. 

Increased competition could reduce the demand for our products and services, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. 

 Competition is an important risk that our business faces and should be considered along with other risk factors that we discuss in Item 1A, Risk Factors. 

 REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT 

We are subject to an increasing number of extensive and complex federal and state laws and regulations intended to protect shareholders of mutual funds and investors of registered investment advisors. We believe we are in compliance in all material respects with all applicable laws and regulations. 

 We are registered as an investment advisor with the SEC and, therefore, must comply with the requirements of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and related SEC regulations. Such requirements relate to, among other things, fiduciary duties to investors, transactions with investors, compliance program effectiveness, solicitation arrangements, conflicts of interest, advertising, recordkeeping and reporting, disclosure, and anti-fraud matters. 

 We manage accounts for the Hennessy Funds on a discretionary basis, meaning that we have the authority to buy and sell securities for each portfolio, select broker-dealers
 to execute trades, and negotiate brokerage commission rates. In connection with certain of these transactions, we receive soft dollar credits from broker-dealers that have the effect of reducing certain of our expenses. All of our soft dollar arrangements are intended to be within the safe harbor provided by Section 28(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ). If our ability to use soft dollars were reduced or eliminated as a result of the implementation of statutory amendments or new regulations, our operating expenses would increase. 
 Our mutual funds are registered with the SEC under the Investment Company Act of 1940, which imposes additional obligations on both the Hennessy Funds and us, as the advisor to the Hennessy Funds, including detailed operational requirements. While we exercise broad discretion over the day-to-day

 management of the business, affairs, and investment portfolios of the Hennessy Funds, our operations are subject to oversight and management by the Funds Board of Trustees. The responsibilities of the Funds Board of Trustees include, among other things, annually approving the continuation of our investment advisory agreements and shareholder servicing agreement with the Hennessy Funds and our sub-advisory
 agreements with the sub-advisors
 to the Hennessy Funds, approving other service providers, determining the method of valuing assets, and monitoring transactions involving affiliates. The Investment Company Act of 1940 also imposes on us a fiduciary duty with respect to receiving investment advisory fees. That fiduciary duty may be enforced by the SEC, by administrative action, or through litigation initiated by investors in the Hennessy Funds pursuant to a private right of action. 
 The SEC is authorized to institute proceedings and impose sanctions for violations of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and the Investment Company Act of 1940, ranging from fines and censures to the suspension of individual employees to termination of our registration as an investment advisor. A violation of applicable law or regulations could also subject us, our directors, and our employees to civil actions brought by private parties. We believe we are in compliance in all material respects with all applicable SEC requirements.

 EMPLOYEES 

As of the end of fiscal year 2021, we had 20 employees, 18 of whom were full-time employees. Our 20 employees had an average tenure of 12 years as of the end of fiscal year 2021. We have historically experienced very low employee turnover, which we attribute to our focus on competitive compensation, a friendly and flexible office environment, and fostering close-knit working relationships among our team members. Further, over 50 of our employees are women, and with an executive team that is 50 women and 25 minority, we believe we have created an environment in which all team members can be successful and supported. 

 Our executive officers are (i) Neil J. Hennessy, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of our Board of Directors, (ii) Teresa M. Nilsen, President, Chief Operating Officer, and a member of our Board of Directors, (iii) Kathryn R. Fahy, Chief Financial Officer and Senior Vice President, and (iv) Daniel B. Steadman, Executive Vice President and a member of our Board of Directors. In addition to our executive officers responsibilities at Hennessy Advisors, Inc., (a) Mr. Hennessy is President, Chief Market Strategist, and a Portfolio Manager of the Hennessy Funds and is a member of the Funds Board of Trustees, (b) Ms. Nilsen is an Executive Vice President and Treasurer of the Hennessy Funds, (c) Ms. Fahy is Vice President, Assistant Treasurer, and Assistant Secretary of the Hennessy Funds, and (d) Mr. Steadman is an Executive Vice President and Secretary of the Hennessy Funds.

ITEM 1A.

RISK FACTORS 

We face many risks and uncertainties, many of which are inherent in the financial services industry and the investment advisory business. Investors should carefully consider the risks described below, together with all of the other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K,
 in evaluating us and our common stock. Our business, results of operations, financial condition, and stock price could be materially adversely affected by any of the risks we face, including those described below. 
 RISKS RELATING TO OUR ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT 

Volatility in and disruption of the capital markets and changes in the economy may significantly affect our revenues. 

The securities markets are inherently volatile and may be affected by factors beyond our control, including global economic conditions, industry trends, interest and inflation rate fluctuations, and other factors that are difficult to predict. Because our assets under management is largely concentrated in equity products, our results are particularly susceptible to downturns in the equity markets. We derive all of our operating revenues from investment advisory fees and shareholder service fees paid to us by the Hennessy Funds. These fees are calculated as a percentage of the average daily net asset value of the Hennessy Funds. Accordingly, our revenues increase or decrease as our average assets under management increases or decreases, which is affected by market appreciation or depreciation and purchases and redemptions of shares of the Hennessy Funds. 

 Investors in the Hennessy Funds can redeem their investments at any time and for any reason, including poor investment performance and volatile equity markets. A decline in our assets under management adversely affects our revenues. 

Investors in the Hennessy Funds may redeem their investments at any time and for any reason without prior notice. Success in the investment advisory and mutual fund business is largely dependent on investment performance, as well as client servicing and distribution. If the Hennessy Funds perform poorly compared to the mutual funds of other investment advisory firms, we may experience a decrease in purchases of shares and an increase in redemptions of shares of the Hennessy Funds. Further, sharp declines in the stock market, such as those experienced during our fiscal year 2020 as a result of the COVID-19
 pandemic, may also cause increases in redemptions of shares of the Hennessy Funds. Such redemptions reduce our assets under management and adversely affect our revenues. 

20 

Table of Contents 
 The COVID-19
 pandemic has adversely impacted, and future pandemics may adversely impact, our business and financial performance. 

The COVID-19
 pandemic adversely impacted global commercial activity and contributed to significant volatility in global equity and debt markets and disrupted, and in some cases continues to disrupt, supply chains, operations, and economic activity. The COVID-19
 pandemic adversely impacted the value and performance of the Hennessy Funds assets under management, which resulted in declines in the Company s revenues. It also limited our ability to source and pursue potential acquisitions. Future pandemic outbreaks could have similar adverse impacts on our business and financial performance. 
 Adverse opinions of the Hennessy Funds by third parties, including rating agencies or industry analysts, could decrease new investments in, or accelerate redemptions from, the Hennessy Funds, which would adversely affect our revenues. 

The Hennessy Funds are rated, ranked, and assessed by independent third parties, including rating agencies, industry analysts, distribution partners, and industry periodicals. These ratings, rankings, and assessments often influence the investment decisions of investors, but they can be affected by a number of factors that are not under our direct control and may change frequently. For example, a ranking agency like Morningstar may change its ranking designs and methodology, which could result in a decrease in the ratings of the Hennessy Funds without any action on our part. If the Hennessy Funds received an adverse rating, ranking, or assessment from a third party, it could result in an increase in the withdrawal of assets from the Hennessy Funds by existing investors and the inability to attract additional investments into the Hennessy Funds from existing and new investors, thereby reducing our assets under management and adversely affecting our revenues. 

 The failure or negative performance of products offered by competitors may have a negative impact on the Hennessy Funds within such similar product type, irrespective of our fund performance. 

Many competitors offer similar products to the Hennessy Funds, and the failure or negative performance of competitors products could lead to a loss of confidence in the corresponding products in the Hennessy Funds lineup, irrespective of the performance of the Hennessy Funds. Any loss of confidence in a product type could lead to redemptions in the Hennessy Fund within such product type, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. 

 RISKS RELATING TO OUR BUSINESS MODEL AND OPERATIONS 

We derive a substantial portion of our revenues from a limited number of the Hennessy Funds. 

For the past several years, approximately three quarters of our assets under management has been concentrated in four of our funds. During fiscal year 2021, our average assets under management was concentrated in the following four funds: (i) the Hennessy Focus Fund (29 of average assets under management); (ii) the Hennessy Japan Fund (21 of average assets under management); (iii) the Hennessy Gas Utility Fund (14 of average assets under management); and (iv) the Hennessy Cornerstone Mid Cap 30 Fund (10 of average assets under management). Consequently, our revenues followed a similar pattern of concentration: (a) the Hennessy Focus Fund (34 of total revenue); (b) the Hennessy Japan Fund (21 of total revenue); (c) the Hennessy Mid Cap 30 Fund (9 of total revenue); and (d) the Hennessy Gas Utility Fund (8 of total revenue). As a result, our operating results are particularly dependent upon the performance of a very small number funds and our ability to maintain and grow assets under management in these funds. If any of these funds were to experience a significant increase in redemptions for any reason, our assets under management would be reduced, adversely affecting our revenues. 

21 

Table of Contents 
 We utilize unaffiliated sub-advisors
 to manage the portfolio composition of certain of the Hennessy Funds, and any matters that have an adverse impact on their businesses or any change in our relationships with our sub-advisors
 could lead to a reduction in assets under management, which would adversely affect our revenues. 

We utilize unaffiliated sub-advisors
 to manage the portfolio composition of some of the Hennessy Funds. Although we perform due diligence on our sub-advisors,
 we do not manage their day-to-day

 business activities. Our financial condition and profitability may be adversely affected by situations that are specific to such sub-advisors,
 such as disruption of their operations, their exposure to disciplinary action, or reputational harm to them. 
 We periodically negotiate the terms and conditions of these sub-advisory
 relationships, and there can be no assurance that such terms will remain acceptable to us or our sub-advisors.
 These relationships may also be terminated by us or the applicable sub-advisor
 upon short notice without penalty. An interruption or termination of our sub-advisory
 relationships could affect our ability to market our sub-advised
 funds and result in a reduction in assets under management, which would adversely affect our revenues. 
 We depend on key personnel to manage our business, and the loss of any key person s services, combined with our inability to identify and retain a suitable replacement for such person, could materially adversely affect us. Additionally, the cost to retain our key personnel could put pressure on our operating margins. 

Our success is largely dependent on the skills, experience, and performance of our key personnel. The business acumen, investment advisory expertise, and business relationships of our key personnel are critical elements in operating and expanding our business. Financial services professionals are in high demand, and we face significant competition for qualified employees. The loss of services of any of our key personnel for any reason, combined with our inability to identify and retain a suitable replacement for such person, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Moreover, in order to retain key personnel, we may be required to increase compensation to such individuals, resulting in additional expense. 

 We have debt and may incur additional debt, which may increase the risk of investing in us and may harm our financial condition and results of operations. 

Borrowings, also known as leverage, magnify the potential for gain or loss on amounts invested and therefore increase the risks associated with investing in our securities.

 As of the end of fiscal year 2021, we had no outstanding indebtedness. On October 20, 2021, we completed a public offering of 4.875 unsecured notes due 2026 in the aggregate principal amount of 40,250,000. The 2026 Notes mature on December 31, 2026, and may be redeemed in whole or in part at any time or from time to time at our option on or after December 31, 2023. The 2026 Notes bear interest at a rate of 4.875 per year payable quarterly on March 31, June 30, September 30, and December 31. The 2026 Notes are direct unsecured obligations, rank equally in right of payment with any of our future unsecured unsubordinated indebtedness, senior to any of our future indebtedness that expressly provides that it is subordinate to the 2026 Notes, effectively subordinate to all of our existing and future secured indebtedness, and structurally subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and other obligations of any future subsidiaries of ours. 

 We may incur additional debt in the future. Our indebtedness could (i) decrease our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, general corporate or other purposes, (ii) limit our flexibility to make acquisitions, (iii) increase our cash requirements to support the payment of interest, (iv) limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and our industry, and (v) increase our vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic and industry conditions. Our ability to make payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness depends upon our future performance, which is subject to general economic conditions and financial, business, and other factors affecting our consolidated operations, many of which are beyond our control. 

22 

Table of Contents 
 We depend on third-party investment professionals and the distribution channels they utilize to market the Hennessy Funds. 

Our primary source of distribution of the Hennessy Funds is through intermediaries that include national, regional, and independent broker-dealers, financial planners, and registered investment advisors. Our success is highly dependent on access to these various distribution channels. We cannot guarantee we will be able to retain access to these channels at similar pricing or at all. Increasing competition for these distribution channels could cause our distribution costs to rise, which could have a material adverse effect on our net income. These distribution intermediaries generally can terminate their relationships with us on short notice. Mergers and other corporate transactions among distributors also may affect our distribution relationships. Moreover, regulations have led to significant shifts in distributors business models and more limited product offerings, which has resulted in reduced distribution of certain of the Hennessy Funds, and additional regulations could lead to further adverse changes. Our lack of access to these distribution channels material adversely affects our business because investment professionals may opt not to distribute the Hennessy Funds if we are no longer participants on the platforms of firms that permit their investment professionals to utilize no-load
 funds for their investors. Either of these events could cause the net assets of the Hennessy Funds to decline, which would decrease our revenues and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. 
 In addition, these intermediaries generally offer their customers a broad array of investment products that are in addition to, and compete with, the Hennessy Funds. The intermediaries or their customers may favor competing investment products over the Hennessy Funds. To the extent that current or future intermediaries or their customers prefer to do business with our competitors, our market share, revenues, and net income could decline. 

 Management contracts purchased by us are currently classified as an indefinite-life
 asset subject to impairment analysis. The impairment analysis is based on subjective criteria, and an impairment loss could be recorded. 

The management contracts we have purchased, an 80.6 million asset on the balance sheet as of the end of fiscal year 2021, are considered an intangible asset with an indefinite useful life. Management reviews the indefinite life classification of our management contracts asset each reporting period. If the management contracts asset is ever reclassified as an asset with a definite life, we would begin amortizing the management contracts over their remaining useful life. If the management contracts asset continues to be classified as an indefinite-life
 asset, we will continue to periodically review the carrying value to determine if any impairment has occurred. The impairment analysis is based on anticipated future cash flows, which are calculated based on assets under management. Although the management contracts asset is not currently impaired, there is always a possibility of impairment in the future, which could require us to write off all or a portion of the asset. A write-off,
 depending on the amount, could have operational risks and could have a significant impact on the value of our equity and our earnings per share. 
 We may be required to forego all or a portion of our fees under our investment advisory agreements with the Hennessy Funds. 

On an annual basis, the Funds Board of Trustees must assess the reasonableness of our investment advisory fees. While the Funds Board of Trustees has found our investment advisory fees to be reasonable in the past, we cannot guarantee that it will continue to do so. Additionally, we regularly analyze the expense ratios of the Hennessy Funds and have the right to waive fees to compete with other mutual funds with lower expense ratios (although in the past we have only waived fees based on contractual obligations). Any waiver of or reduction in fees would cause our revenues to decline and could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Any fee waiver would apply only on a going-forward
 basis. 
 The Hennessy Japan Fund and the Hennessy Japan Small Cap Fund invest in the Japanese stock market in yen, which involves foreign exchange and economic uncertainties. 

The Hennessy Japan Fund and the Hennessy Japan Small Cap Fund are invested in securities listed on the Japanese stock market, which exposes these funds to risks that are not typically associated with an investment in a U.S. issuer. The values of these funds fluctuate with changes in the value of the Japanese yen versus the U.S. dollar. Investments in Japanese securities also expose these funds to the economic uncertainties affecting Japan, which may differ from those affecting the United States. For example, the adverse effects of the COVID-19
 pandemic, future variants of COVID-19,
 or future pandemics may disproportionately impact Japan. Further, Japanese financial accounting standards and practices may differ, and there may be less information on Japanese companies available publicly. If these circumstances result in a reduction in the total assets of the Hennessy Japan Fund and the Hennessy Japan Small Cap Fund, our assets under management would be reduced, which would adversely affect our revenues.

 We utilize quantitative investment strategies for some of the Hennessy Funds that require us to invest in specific portfolios of securities and hold these positions for a specified period of time regardless of performance. 

Our formula-driven
 funds adhere to quantitative investment strategies, and the portfolios of stocks held by such funds are rescreened and rebalanced at designated times in accordance with such investment strategies. Adhering to our investment strategies regardless of any adverse developments that may arise could result in substantial losses to the formula-driven
 Hennessy Funds if, for example, the stocks selected for a fund are experiencing financial difficulty or are out of favor with investors in a given period This could, in theory, result in relatively low performance of the formula-driven
 Hennessy Funds and adversely affect the net assets of such Hennessy Funds. A decrease in the net assets of the Hennessy Funds would adversely affect our revenues. 
 We pursue strategic asset purchases as part of our regular business strategy, and such acquisitions involve inherent risks that could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition and potentially dilute the holdings of current shareholders. 

As part of our regular business strategy, we pursue strategic purchases of the assets related to the management of additional mutual funds. This strategy is accompanied by risks including, among others, the possibility of the following: 

the potential unavailability of attractive acquisition opportunities; 

a high level of competition from other companies that may have greater financial resources than we do; 

our inability to value potential asset purchases accurately and negotiate acceptable purchase terms; 

our inability to obtain quorum and secure enough affirmative votes to gain approval of the proposed fund reorganization from the target fund s shareholders; 

the loss of mutual fund assets paid for in an asset purchase through redemptions by shareholders of the mutual funds involved in the asset purchase; 

higher than anticipated asset purchase expenses; 

our inability to successfully integrate and maintain adequate infrastructure to support business growth; 

increasing our leverage; 

the potential diversion of our management s time and attention; 

dilution to our shareholders if we fund an asset purchase in whole or in part with our common stock; and 

adverse effects on our earnings if purchased intangible assets become impaired. 

While we seek to mitigate these risks through, among other things, due diligence and indemnification provisions, these or other risk-mitigating measures that we put in place may not be sufficient to address these risks. If one or more of these risks occur, we may be unable to successfully complete a purchase of management-related
 assets (thereby requiring us to write off any related expenses), we may experience an impairment of our management contract asset, we may receive negative publicity or suffer other negative impacts on our reputation, and we may not achieve the expected return on investment. Any of these results could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.

 Our investment advisory and shareholder servicing agreements can be terminated on short notice, are not freely assignable, and must be renewed annually; the loss of such agreements would reduce our revenues. 

We generate all of our operating revenues from the investment advisory and shareholder servicing agreements with the Hennessy Funds. These agreements may be terminated without penalty on 60 days notice and may not be assigned without the consent of investors in the Hennessy Funds. In addition, they each must be renewed annually by the Funds Board of Trustees (or, in the case of our investment advisory agreements, by the vote of a majority of the outstanding shares of the applicable Hennessy Fund), including a majority of the disinterested trustees. The termination or non-renewal
 of these agreements, or the renegotiation of the terms of these agreements in a manner detrimental to us, could result in a substantial reduction in revenues, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. 
 RISKS RELATING TO OUR INDUSTRY 

Investor behavior is influenced by short-term investment performance of mutual funds. 

Investor behavior may be based on many factors, including short-term investment performance. Poor short term performance of the Hennessy Funds, irrespective of longer term success, could potentially lead to a decrease in purchases of shares of the Hennessy Funds and an increase in redemptions, thereby reducing our assets under management and adversely affecting our revenues. 

 Assets invested through third-party intermediaries carry the risk of redemption, which could reduce our revenues. 

Third-party intermediaries are attractive to investors because of the ease of accessibility to a variety of funds, but this may cause the investments to be more sensitive to fluctuations in performance, especially in the short-term. If we were unable to retain the assets of the Hennessy Funds held through third-party intermediaries, our assets under management would be reduced. As a result, our revenues could decline and our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. 

 We face intense competition in attracting investors and retaining net assets in the Hennessy Funds. 

The investment advisory industry is intensely competitive, and new participants are continually entering the industry. We compete directly with numerous global and U.S. investment advisors, commercial banks, savings and loan associations, brokerage and investment banking firms, broker-dealers, insurance companies, and other financial institutions that often provide investment products with similar features and objectives to those we offer. These institutions range from small boutique firms to large financial services complexes. We are considered a small investment advisory company. Many competing companies are part of larger financial services companies that conduct business in more markets and have greater marketing, financial, technical, research, and distribution resources and other capabilities than we do. Most of the larger firms offer a broader range of financial services to the same retail and institutional investors that we seek to serve. If we are unable to attract investors and retain net assets in the Hennessy Funds due to increased competition, our revenues could decline and we could experience a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. 

 For more information regarding competitive factors, see the Competition subheading in Item 1, Business. 

 Market consolidation and industry trends could negatively impact our business. 

In recent years, there have been several instances of industry consolidation in both the distribution and investment management areas. Further consolidation may occur in these areas in the future. The increasing size and market influence of certain distributors of our products and of certain direct competitors may have a negative impact on our ability to compete at the same levels of profitability in the future. Additionally, the market environment in recent years has led some investors to increasingly favor lower fee, passive products. As a result, investment advisors that emphasize passive products have gained, and may continue to gain, market share from active managers like us. While we cannot predict how much market share these competitors will gain, we believe there will always be demand for good active management.

 Industry trends and market pressure to lower our investment advisory fees could reduce our profit margin. 

Our profits are highly dependent on the fees we are able to charge to the Hennessy Funds for investment advisory services. To the extent we are forced to compete on the basis of the investment advisory fees we charge to the Hennessy Funds, we may not be able to maintain our current fee structures. We have historically competed primarily on the performance of the Hennessy Funds and not on the level of our investment advisory fees relative to those of our competitors. In recent years, however, there has been a trend toward lower fees in the investment advisory industry. To maintain our fee structures in a competitive environment, we must be able to provide our mutual fund investors with investment returns and service that will adequately compensate them for investing in our mutual funds with our current fee structures. We may not succeed in maintaining our current fee structures, and fee reductions on existing or future business could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. 

 Higher insurance premiums and increased insurance coverage risks could increase our costs and reduce our profitability. 

We carry insurance in amounts and under terms that we believe are appropriate, but we cannot guarantee that our insurance policies will cover all liabilities and losses to which we may be exposed or, if covered, that such liabilities and losses will not exceed insurance coverage limits or that our insurers will remain solvent and meet their obligations. In addition, insurance premiums and required retentions have increased in recent years and may continue to do so. 

 We are subject to regulatory and governmental inquiries and civil litigation. An adverse outcome of any such proceeding could involve substantial financial penalties. Various claims may also arise against us in the ordinary course of business, such as employment-related claims. There has been increased incidence of litigation and regulatory investigations in the financial services industry in recent years, including customer claims and class action suits alleging substantial monetary damages. Certain insurance coverage may not be available or may be prohibitively expensive in future periods. As our insurance policies come up for renewal, we may need to assume higher deductibles or co-insurance
 liabilities, or pay higher premiums, which would increase our expenses and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. 
 We are highly dependent on various software applications and other technologies, as well as on third parties who utilize various software applications and other technologies, for our business to function properly and to safeguard confidential information; any significant limitation, failure, or security breach could adversely affect our operations. 

We use software and related technologies throughout our business and also utilize third-party vendors who use software and related technologies to provide services to us and the Hennessy Funds. Although we take protective measures (including striving to understand the protective measures taken by our third-party vendors) and endeavor to modify such protective measures as circumstances warrant, we may experience system delays and interruptions as a result of natural disasters, power failures, acts of war, third-party failures, or other unexpected events. We cannot predict with certainty all of the adverse effects that could result from the failure to efficiently address and resolve these delays and interruptions. 

 We could also be subject to losses if we fail to properly safeguard sensitive and confidential and proprietary information that we and our third-party
 vendors store and transmit as part of our normal business operations. Although we take protective measures, the security of our and our vendors computer systems, software, and networks may be vulnerable to hacking, breaches, unauthorized access, misuse, computer viruses, or other malicious code, as well as to other events that could have a security impact, such as an employee or vendor inadvertently or intentionally causing us to release confidential or proprietary information. Additionally, although we take precautions to password protect and encrypt our laptops and other mobile electronic hardware, if such hardware is stolen, misplaced, or left unattended, it may become vulnerable to hacking or other unauthorized use, creating a possible security risk and resulting in potentially costly actions.

Table of Contents 
 There have been a number of highly publicized cases in recent years involving financial services and consumer-based companies reporting the unauthorized disclosure of client or customer information, as well as cyber-attacks involving the dissemination, theft, and destruction of corporate information or other assets, as a result of employees or contractors failure to follow procedures or as a result of actions by third parties, including actions by terrorist organizations and hostile foreign governments. We, the Hennessy Funds, and our third-party vendors may be vulnerable to such unauthorized disclosures and cyber-attacks. Our increased use of mobile and cloud technologies could heighten these and other operational risks, and any failure by mobile technology and cloud service providers to adequately safeguard their systems and prevent cyber-attacks
 could disrupt our operations and result in misappropriation, corruption, or loss of confidential or proprietary information. 
 If any of these events were to occur, we could suffer a financial loss, a disruption of our business, liability to the Hennessy Funds and their investors, regulatory intervention, or reputational damage, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. We also may be required to expend significant additional resources to modify our protective measures or to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures. 

 Finally, cybersecurity and data privacy have become high priorities for regulators, and many jurisdictions are enacting laws and regulations in these areas. Two such laws are the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, which took effect in 2020, and the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020, which will take effect in 2023. Enactment of new privacy laws or regulations could, among other things, result in additional costs of compliance or litigation. In addition, while we strive to comply with the relevant laws and regulations, any failure to comply could result in regulatory investigations and penalties as well as negative publicity, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. 

 We are exposed to legal risk and litigation, which could increase our expenses and reduce our profitability. 

In recent years, the volume of claims and amount of damages claimed in litigation and regulatory proceedings against the financial services industry have been increasing. While we strive to conduct our business in accordance with the highest ethical standards, we nevertheless remain exposed to litigation risk. We could be sued by many different parties, including, by way of example, investors in the Hennessy Funds, our own shareholders, our employees, or regulators. Lawsuits or investigations that we may become involved in could be very expensive and highly damaging to our reputation, even if the underlying claims are without merit. 

 In addition, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act amended the Exchange Act to compensate and protect whistleblowers who voluntarily provide original information to the SEC and establishes a fund to be used to pay whistleblowers who will be entitled to receive a payment equal to between 10 and 30 of certain monetary sanctions imposed in a successful government action resulting from the information provided by the whistleblower. According to an annual report to Congress on the Dodd-Frank Whistleblower Program, whistleblower claims have increased significantly since the enactment of these provisions. Addressing such claims could generate significant expenses and take up significant management time, even if such claims are frivolous or without merit. 

 Our business is extensively regulated, which increases our costs of doing business, and our failure to comply with regulatory requirements may harm our financial condition. 

Our business is subject to extensive regulation in the United States, particularly by the SEC. We are subject to regulation under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, the Exchange Act, the Investment Company Act of 1940, the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, and various other statutes. The laws to which we are subject are designed primarily to protect investors in the Hennessy Funds as opposed to our shareholders. In addition to an increased number of applicable laws, the mutual fund industry has undergone increased scrutiny by the SEC and state regulators in recent years, resulting in numerous enforcement actions and sweep examinations. Increased regulation has increased our costs in managing the Hennessy Funds, and we could continue to experience higher costs if new laws require us to spend more time, hire additional personnel, or buy new technology to comply effectively. Any change in law could also have a material adverse effect on us by limiting the sources of our revenues and increasing our costs. In addition to securities regulations, our business also may be materially adversely affected by other types of laws and policies. For example, the amount of net assets in the Hennessy Funds in a given time period could be affected by existing and proposed tax legislation or the interest rate policies of the Federal Reserve Board. 

27 

Table of Contents 
 In recent years, we have been affected by changes in law such as the U.S. Department of Labor fiduciary rule, which significantly expanded the class of advisers and the scope of investment advice that are subject to fiduciary standards, and the SEC s Regulation Best Interest Regulation BI ), which requires broker-dealers
 to act in the retail customer s best interest and not place the broker-dealer s interests ahead of the retail customer s interests. Both the fiduciary rule and Regulation BI caused financial advisers and broker-dealers
 to make significant operational changes, including, in some cases, removing one or more of the Hennessy Funds from their platforms. This resulted in fewer purchases of shares and increased redemptions of shares of the Hennessy Funds, and the effects of such regulations may persist even if they are ultimately replaced, retracted, or overturned. For example, while the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit issued a mandate vacating the fiduciary rule in its entirety in June 2018, many companies had already implemented a number of business and compliance initiatives in order to change their distribution methods and operations in response to the rule, and most of these companies did not halt these initiatives following the court s ruling. 
 Although we strive to conduct our business in accordance with applicable law, if we were found to have violated an applicable law, we could be subject to fines, suspensions of personnel, or other sanctions, including revocation of our registration as an investment advisor. If a sanction were imposed against us or our personnel, even if only for a small monetary amount, the adverse publicity related to such a sanction could harm our reputation, result in redemptions by investors in the Hennessy Funds, and impede our ability to attract new investors, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. 

 Changes to U.S. or state tax laws, our failure to adequately comply with U.S. or state tax laws, or the outcome of any audits or regulatory disputes with respect to our compliance with U.S. or state tax laws could adversely affect us. 

Changes to U.S. or state tax law could be enacted in the future that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Further, we are subject to potential tax audits in various jurisdictions and in such event, tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken and assess penalties or additional taxes. While we assess regularly the likely outcomes of these potential audits, there can be no assurance that we will accurately predict the outcome of a potential audit, and an audit could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. 

 Our investment advisory agreements require us to adhere to the investment policies and strategies of the Hennessy Funds; any failure to comply with such requirements could result in claims, losses, or regulatory sanctions. 

Our investment advisory agreements with the Hennessy Funds contain contractual provisions that require us to comply with the investment policies and strategies of the Hennessy Funds when we provide our investment advisory services. We are also required to comply with numerous investment, asset valuation, distribution, and tax requirements under applicable law and regulations. Any allegation of a failure to adhere to these requirements could result in investor claims, reputational damage, withdrawal of assets, and potential regulatory sanctions, any of which could negatively impact our revenues and earnings. We have implemented procedures and utilize the services of experienced administrators, accountants, and lawyers to assist in satisfying these requirements, but there can be no assurance that these precautions will protect us from potential liabilities. 

We may need to raise additional capital to fund new business initiatives, and resources may not be available to us in sufficient amounts or on acceptable terms, which could have an adverse impact on our business. 

Our ability to meet our future cash needs is dependent upon our ability to generate cash. Although we have been successful in generating sufficient cash in the past, we may not be successful in the future. We may need to raise additional capital to fund new business initiatives, and financing may not be available to us in sufficient amounts, on acceptable terms, or at all. Our ability to access bank financing or capital markets efficiently depends on a number of factors, including the state of credit and equity markets, interest rates, and credit spreads. If we are unable to access sufficient capital on acceptable terms, our business could be adversely impacted. 

 Failure to establish adequate controls and risk management policies, as well as circumvention of established controls and policies by employees, could harm us by impairing our ability to attract and retain investors in the Hennessy Funds and by subjecting us to significant legal liability, regulatory scrutiny, and reputational harm. 

Our reputation is critical to attracting and retaining investors in the Hennessy Funds. In recent years, there have been a number of highly publicized cases involving fraud, conflicts of interest, or other misconduct by individuals in the financial services industry. We have extensive controls and risk management policies to monitor and manage risks, but we cannot be certain that such controls and policies will successfully identify and manage internal and external risks. Further, although we strive to conduct our business in accordance with the highest ethical standards and emphasize the importance of doing so to our employees, there is a risk that our employees could engage in misconduct that adversely affects our business. For example, if an employee were to engage in, or be accused of engaging in, illegal or suspicious activity (such as improper trading, disclosure of confidential information, or breach of fiduciary duties), we could be subject to regulatory sanctions and suffer serious harm to our reputation, financial position, and ability to maintain and grow the number of investors in the Hennessy Funds.

 The historical performance of the Hennessy Funds should not be considered indicative of the future results of the Hennessy Funds or of any returns expected on our common stock. 

The historical performance of the Hennessy Funds is relevant to returns on our common stock only insofar as the fees we have earned in the past and may earn in the future, which are based on average assets under management, may impact the performance of our common stock. Positive performance of the Hennessy Funds typically increases our revenues, which in turn could positively affect our business, and poor performance typically reduces our revenues, which in turn could adversely affect our business. However, the historical and potential future returns of the Hennessy Funds are not directly linked to returns on our common stock, such that positive performance of the Hennessy Funds will not necessarily result in positive returns on our common stock and poor performance of the Hennessy Funds will not necessary result in negative returns on our common stock. Moreover, the historical performance of the Hennessy Funds should not be considered indicative of the future results that should be expected from such funds. 

 RISKS RELATING TO OUR COMMON STOCK 

Ownership of a large percentage of our common stock is concentrated with a small number of shareholders, which could increase the volatility in our stock trading and significantly affect our share price and causes us to experience limited trading volume in our securities. 

We have a limited number of shareholders, and a large percentage of our common stock is held by an even fewer number of shareholders. If our larger shareholders were to decide to liquidate their ownership positions, it could cause significant fluctuations in the share price of our common stock. Having a limited number of shareholders also causes us to experience limited trading volume in our securities. 

 We intend to pay regular dividends to our shareholders, but our ability to do so is subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors. 

We have consistently paid dividends each year since 2005, but the declaration, amount, and payment of dividends to our shareholders by us are subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors. Our Board of Directors takes into account general economic and business conditions, our strategic plans, our financial results and condition, any contractual, legal, and regulatory restrictions on our payment of dividends, and such other factors as our Board of Directors deems relevant to determining whether to declare dividends and the amount of such dividends.

PROPERTIES. 

Our principal executive office is located at 7250 Redwood Boulevard, Suite 200, Novato, California 94945, where we occupy approximately 13,728 square feet and have the right to use all common areas. We also lease office space in Austin, Texas, Boston, Massachusetts, and Chapel Hill, North Carolina. We consider these arrangements to be suitable and adequate for the management and operations of our business. We do not own any real property.

MARKET FOR REGISTRANT S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS, AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES 

Until October 18, 2021, our common stock traded on The Nasdaq Capital Market under the stock symbol HNNA. On October 13, 2021, following the end of our fiscal year 2021, we submitted an application to transfer our common stock from The Nasdaq Capital Market to The Nasdaq Global Market, and on October 19, 2021, our common stock began trading on The Nasdaq Global Market, where it continues to trade under the stock symbol HNNA. 

 We have paid regular cash dividends to our shareholders and intend to continue to do so, although the declaration of a dividend is always subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors. 

 As of the end of fiscal year 2021, we had 132 holders of record of our common stock. In addition, there were 45 brokerage firm accounts that represent 1,997 additional individual shareholders for a total of 2,129 shareholders. 

 The equity compensation plan information required by Item 201(d) of Regulation S-K

FORWARD-LOOKING
 STATEMENTS 

 This report contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the securities laws, for which we claim the protection of the safe harbor for forward-looking
 statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. In some cases, forward-looking statements can be identified by terminology such as expect, anticipate, intend, may, plan, will, should, could, would, assume, believe, estimate, predict, potential, project, continue, seek, and similar expressions, as well as statements in the future tense. We have based these forward-looking statements on our current expectations and projections about future events, based on information currently available to us. Forward-looking statements should not be read as a guarantee of future performance or results, and will not necessarily be accurate indications of the times at which, or means by which, such performance or results will be achieved.

 Forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties, and assumptions, including those described in the section titled Risk Factors and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 Unforeseen developments could cause actual performance or results to differ substantially from those expressed in or suggested by the forward-looking
 statements. Management does not assume responsibility for the accuracy or completeness of these forward-looking
 statements. There is no regulation requiring an update of any of the forward-looking statements after the date of this report to conform these statements to actual results or to changes in our expectations. 
 Our business activities are affected by many factors, including, without limitation, redemptions by mutual fund shareholders, taxes, general economic and business conditions, including those related to the COVID-19
 pandemic, movement of interest rates, competitive conditions, industry regulation, and fluctuations in the stock market, many of which are beyond the control of our management. Further, the business and regulatory environments in which we operate remain complex, uncertain, and subject to change. We expect that regulatory requirements and developments will cause us to incur additional administrative and compliance costs. Notwithstanding the variability in our economic and regulatory environments, we remain focused on the investment performance of the Hennessy Funds and on providing high-quality
 customer service to investors. 
 Our business strategy centers on (i) the identification, completion, and integration of future acquisitions and (ii) organic growth, through both the retention of the mutual fund assets we currently manage and the generation of inflows into the mutual funds we manage. The success of our business strategy may be influenced by the factors discussed in Item 1A, Risk Factors. All statements regarding our business strategy, as well as statements regarding market trends and risks and assumptions about changes in the marketplace, are forward-looking
 by their nature. 
 OUR CONTINUING RESPONSE TO THE COVID-19
 PANDEMIC 

 We continue to monitor the effects of the COVID-19
 pandemic on our business, particularly focusing on meeting the needs of our employees, our partners, and the Hennessy Funds and their shareholders. Since March 2020, we have remained engaged with key partners and service providers, strengthened our digital marketing and public relations programs, maintained an effective governance and internal controls program, and kept our employees up to date with trainings on relevant government and regulatory guidance impacting in-office
 work in order to ensure our continued success. 
 We returned to work in the Novato, California office in August 2021, and continue to adhere to our Site-Specific Protection Plan, which we regularly update to reflect current local, state, and federal requirements. 

 We remain committed to providing the same high level of services to the 16 Hennessy Funds and their shareholders, and we believe we have positioned the Company for long-term growth. 

 OVERVIEW 

Our primary business activity is providing investment advisory services to a family of open-end
 mutual funds branded as the Hennessy Funds. We manage 10 of the 16 Hennessy Funds internally. For the remaining six funds, we have delegated the day-to-day

 portfolio management responsibilities to sub-advisors,
 subject to our oversight. We oversee the selection and continued employment of each sub-advisor,
 review each fund s investment performance, and monitor each sub-advisor s
 adherence to each applicable fund s investment objectives, policies, and restrictions. In addition, we conduct ongoing reviews of the compliance programs of sub-advisors
 and make on-site
 visits to sub-advisors,
 as feasible. Our secondary business activity is providing shareholder services to shareholders of the Hennessy Funds. 
 We derive our operating revenues from investment advisory fees and shareholder service fees paid to us by the Hennessy Funds. These fees are calculated as a percentage of the average daily net assets in each Hennessy Fund. The percentage amount of the investment advisory fees varies by fund. The percentage amount of the shareholder service fees is consistent across all funds, but shareholder service fees are charged on Investor Class shares only. The dollar amount of the fees we receive fluctuates with changes in the average net asset value of each Hennessy Fund, which is affected by each fund s investment performance, purchases and redemptions of shares, general market conditions, and the success of our marketing, sales, and public relations efforts.

Table of Contents 
 U.S. equities had positive performance for the one-year
 period ended September 30, 2021, with the S P 500 
 Index returning 30.00 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average returning 24.15 for the period (on a total return basis). Equity prices advanced sharply during the period despite increased concerns over supply chain disruptions and elevated levels of inflation. The offset to this dynamic was the idea that economic growth has resumed as economies continue to reopen despite the lingering effects of the COVID-19
 pandemic. After a 3.4 contraction in Real GDP in 2020, economic growth is expected to increase 5.9 in 2021, according to estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Over the past year, we have seen widespread availability of vaccines, and with that the ability of an ever-increasing
 number of people to travel, eat in restaurants, and return to work. The unemployment rate improved from 7.9 at the end of September 2020 to 4.8 at the end of September 2021. 
 Long-term U.S. bonds declined meaningfully during the one-year
 period ended September 30, 2021, as the prospect of the Federal Reserve tapering its bond-buying
 activity and potentially raising interest rates as soon as 2022 prompted investors to sell bonds. As the U.S. economy reopens and some semblance of normalcy returns to the economy, investors attention has turned to the idea that inflation may continue to remain elevated, which may prompt the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates. While the Federal Reserve has indicated that they would like to see employment numbers return to pre-pandemic
 levels before raising rates, it seems that some investors are focused on the idea that any further inflationary pressures may force the Federal Reserve to act sooner. For the one-year
 period ended September 30, 2021, 10-year
 U.S. Government Bond yields rose from 0.68 to 1.49 . 
 The Japanese equity market rose 20.61 (in U.S. dollar terms) for the one-year
 period ended September 30, 2021, as measured by the Tokyo Stock Price Index. Enthusiasm around Japanese equities has centered on the country s recent surge in COVID-19
 vaccinations as well as by the election of a new Prime Minister, Fumio Kishida, to replace Yoshihide Suga, who recently resigned. 
 Against this backdrop, all of the 16 Hennessy Funds posted positive returns for the one-year
 period ended September 30, 2021. The longer-term
 performance numbers remain strong, with 14 of the Hennessy Funds posting positive returns for the five-year
 period ended September 30, 2021, and all 14 Hennessy Funds with at least 10 years of operating history posting positive returns for the 10-year
 period ended September 30, 2021. 
 As always, we are committed to providing superior service to investors and employing a consistent and disciplined approach to investing based on a buy-and-hold

 philosophy that rejects the idea of market timing. Our goal is to provide products that investors can have confidence in, knowing their money is invested as promised and with their best interests in mind. Accordingly, we continually seek new and improved ways to support investors in the Hennessy Funds, including by providing thought leadership and other resources to help them navigate through this unprecedented market disruption due to the pandemic. We operate a robust and leading-edge
 marketing automation and customer relationship management (CRM) system, with a database of over 100,000 financial advisors in addition to retail investors. We utilize this technology both to retain assets and to drive new purchases into the Hennessy Funds. We employ a comprehensive marketing and sales program consisting of content, digital, social media, and traditional marketing initiatives and proactive meetings. In addition, our consistent annual public relations campaign has resulted in the Hennessy brand name appearing on TV, radio, print, or online media on average once every two to three days. 
 We provide service to approximately 160,000 mutual fund accounts nationwide, including accounts held by shareholders who employ financial advisors to assist them with investing as well as accounts held by retail shareholders who invest directly with us. We serve over 14,000 financial advisors who utilize the Hennessy Funds on behalf of their clients, including over 800 who purchased one of our Funds for the first time during fiscal year 2021. Approximately 17 of such advisors own two or more Hennessy Funds, and nearly 550 advisors hold a position of over 500,000, demonstrating strong brand loyalty. 

 Total assets under management as of the end of fiscal year 2021 was 4.1 billion, an increase of 0.5 billion, or 14.1 , compared to the end of fiscal year 2020. The increase in total assets during fiscal year 2021 was attributable to market appreciation.

The principal asset on our balance sheet, management contracts, represents the capitalized costs incurred in connection with the purchase of the assets related to the management of mutual funds. As of the end of fiscal year 2021, this asset had a net balance of 80.6 million, unchanged since the end of fiscal year 2020. 

 The principal liability on our balance sheet as of the end of our fiscal year 2021 was the net deferred tax liability of 12.4 million generated due to the continued write-off
 of our management contracts asset for tax purposes, which creates a book-to-tax

 difference. Following the end of our fiscal year 2021, on October 20, 2021, we completed a public offering of 4.875 unsecured notes due 2026 in the aggregate principal amount of 40,250,000. The 2026 Notes mature on December 31, 2026, and may be redeemed in whole or in part at any time or from time to time at our option on or after December 31, 2023. The 2026 Notes bear interest at a rate of 4.875 per year payable quarterly on March 31, June 30, September 30, and December 31. The 2026 Notes are direct unsecured obligations, rank equally in right of payment with any of our future unsecured unsubordinated indebtedness, senior to any of our future indebtedness that expressly provides that it is subordinate to the 2026 Notes, effectively subordinate to all of our existing and future secured indebtedness, and structurally subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and other obligations of any future subsidiaries of ours.

Revenues Investment Advisory Fees and Shareholder Service Fees 

Total revenue comprises investment advisory fees and shareholder service fees. Comparing fiscal year 2021 to fiscal year 2020, total revenue decreased by 1.9 , from 33.4 million to 32.8 million, investment advisory fees decreased by 1.5 , from 30.8 million to 30.4 million, and shareholder service fees decreased by 6.5 , from 2.6 million to 2.4 million. 

 The decrease in investment advisory fees was due to decreased average daily net assets of the Hennessy Funds. The decrease in shareholder service fees was due to a decrease in the average daily net assets held in Investor Class shares of the Hennessy Funds. Assets held in Investor Class shares of the Hennessy Funds are subject to a shareholder service fee, whereas assets held in Institutional Class shares of the Hennessy Funds are not subject to a service fee. 

 We collect investment advisory fees from each Hennessy Fund at differing annual rates. These annual rates range between 0.40 and 1.25 of average daily net assets. Average daily net assets of the Hennessy Funds for fiscal year 2021 was 4.0 billion, which represents a decrease of 0.1 billion, or 2.7 , compared to fiscal year 2020. The Hennessy Fund with the largest average daily net assets for fiscal year 2021 was the Hennessy Focus Fund, with 1.1 billion. We collect an investment advisory fee from the Hennessy Focus Fund at an annual rate of 0.90 of average daily net assets. However, we pay a sub-advisory
 fee at an annual rate of 0.29 to the fund s sub-advisor,
 which reduces the net operating profit contribution of the fund to our financial operations. The Hennessy Fund with the second largest average daily net assets for fiscal year 2021 was the Hennessy Japan Fund, with 844 million. We collect an investment advisory fee from the Hennessy Japan Fund at an annual rate of 0.90 of average daily net assets. However, we pay a sub-advisory
 fee at an annual rate between 0.35 and 0.42 (depending on asset level) to the fund s sub-advisor,
 which reduces the net operating profit contribution of the fund to our financial operations.

Table of Contents 
 Total assets under management as of the end of fiscal year 2021 was 4.1 billion, an increase of 0.5 billion, or 14.1 , compared to the end of fiscal year 2020. The increase was attributable to market appreciation. 

 The Hennessy Funds with the three largest amounts of net inflows were as follows:

 Redemptions as a percentage of assets under management decreased from an average of 3.6 per month during fiscal year 2020 to an average of 2.8 per month during fiscal year 2021. 

 Operating Expenses 

Comparing fiscal year 2020 to fiscal year 2021, total operating expenses remained relatively flat, decreasing by 0.9 , from 22.1 million to 21.9 million. The slight decrease in the dollar amount of operating expenses was due to decreases in many expense categories, partially offset by increases in compensation and benefits expense and mutual fund distribution expense. As a percentage of total revenue, total operating expenses increased 0.7 percentage points to 66.8 . Although the dollar value decreased slightly, operating expenses increased slightly as a percentage of total revenue because some of our operating expenses are fixed costs that did not decrease with decreasing revenue during fiscal year 2021. 

 Compensation and Benefits Expense
: Comparing fiscal year 2020 to fiscal year 2021, compensation and benefits expense increased by 2.9 , from 8.8 million to 9.1 million. As a percentage of total revenue, compensation and benefits expense increased 1.3 percentage points to 27.7 . The increase in compensation and benefits expense was due to an increase in incentive-based
 compensation during fiscal year 2021 resulting from our higher total assets under management, as well as an increase in salary compensation paid to our executive officers compared to our fiscal year 2020, which included five months during which our executive officers agreed to temporary 25 salary reductions. 
 General and Administrative Expense
: Comparing fiscal year 2020 to fiscal year 2021, general and administrative expense decreased by 4.2 , from 5.0 million to 4.8 million. As a percentage of total revenue, general and administrative expense decreased 0.4 percentage points to 14.5 . The decrease in general and administrative expense was due to lower director stock award expense, as well as a reduction in rent expense in our Novato office and a decrease in legal and accounting costs in the current period. 
 Mutual Fund Distribution Expense
: Mutual fund distribution expense consists of fees paid to various financial institutions that offer the Hennessy Funds as potential investments to their clients. When the Hennessy Funds are purchased through one of these financial institutions, the institution typically charges an asset-based
 fee, which is recorded as mutual fund distribution expense on our statement of operations to the extent paid by us. When the Hennessy Funds are purchased directly, we do not incur any such expense. These fees generally increase or decrease in line with the net assets of the Hennessy Funds held through these financial institutions, which are affected by inflows, outflows, and fund performance. In addition, some financial institutions charge a minimum fee if the average daily net assets of a Hennessy Fund held by such an institution are less than a threshold amount. In such cases, we pay the minimum fee. 

35 

Table of Contents 
 Comparing fiscal year 2020 to fiscal year 2021, mutual fund distribution expense increased slightly by 1.7 , from 0.48 million to 0.49 million. As a percentage of total revenue, mutual fund distribution expense increased 0.1 percentage points to 1.5 . The increase in mutual fund distribution expense was due to slightly higher average daily net assets of the Hennessy Funds held at financial institutions in the current period. In the second quarter of the prior fiscal year, significant market depreciation, primarily resulting from the COVID-19
 pandemic, caused a decrease in average daily net assets. 
 Sub-Advisory
 Fees Expense
: Comparing fiscal year 2020 to fiscal year 2021, sub-advisory
 fees expense decreased by 3.2 , from 7.6 million to 7.3 million. As a percentage of total revenue, sub-advisory
 fees expense decreased 0.3 percentage point to 22.4 . The decrease in sub-advisory
 fees was due to a decrease in average daily net assets of the sub-advised
 Hennessy Funds. 
 Depreciation Expense
: Comparing fiscal year 2020 to fiscal year 2021, depreciation expense decreased by 2.9 from 0.24 million to 0.23 million due to the write-off
 of fully depreciated assets. As a percentage of total revenue, depreciation expense remained flat at 0.7 . 
 Interest Expense 

Comparing fiscal year 2020 to fiscal year 2021, interest expense decreased by 100 from 0.4 million to 0. The decrease in interest expense was due to the payoff in full of the remaining outstanding balance under our term loan agreement with U.S. Bank National Association on March 26, 2020. 

 Income Tax Expense 

Comparing fiscal year 2020 to fiscal year 2021, income tax expense decreased by 4.5 , from 3.1 million to 3.0 million. The decrease in income tax expense was due primarily to lower net operating income in the current period. 

 Net Income 

Comparing fiscal year 2020 to fiscal year 2021, net income increased by 0.8 , from 7.8 million to 7.9 million. The increase in net income was primarily due to decreased interest expense in the current period. 

 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 

We continually review our capital requirements to ensure that we have funding available to support our business model. Management anticipates that cash and other liquid assets on hand as of the end of fiscal year 2021 will be sufficient to meet our capital requirements for one year from the issuance date of this report, as well as our longer-term
 capital requirements for periods beyond one year from the issuance date of this report. To the extent that liquid resources and cash provided by operations are not adequate to meet long-term capital requirements, management plans to raise additional capital by either, or both, seeking bank financing or accessing the capital markets. There can be no assurance that we will be able to raise additional capital. 
 Following the end of our fiscal year 2021, on October 20, 2021, the Company completed a public offering of its 2026 Notes in the aggregate principal amount of 40,250,000. The 2026 Notes mature on December 31, 2026, and may be redeemed in whole or in part at any time or from time to time at the Company s option on or after December 31, 2023. The 2026 Notes bear interest at a rate of 4.875 per year payable quarterly on March 31, June 30, September 30, and December 31. The 2026 Notes are the Company s direct unsecured obligations, rank equally in right of payment with any of the Company s future unsecured unsubordinated indebtedness, senior to any of the Company s future indebtedness that expressly provides that it is subordinate to the 2026 Notes, effectively subordinate to all of the Company s existing and future secured indebtedness, and structurally subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and other obligations of any future subsidiaries of the Company. 

 Our total assets under management as of the end of fiscal year 2021 was 4.1 billion, an increase of 0.5 billion, or 14.1 , from the end of fiscal year 2020. The primary sources of our revenues, liquidity, and cash flow are our investment advisory fees and shareholder service fees, which are based on, and generated by, our average assets under management. Our average assets under management for fiscal year 2021 was 4.0 billion. As of the end of fiscal year 2021, we had cash and cash equivalents of 15.8 million.

The decrease in cash provided by operating activities of 0.2 million was due mainly to decreased operating income. 

 The decrease in cash used in investing activities of 0.6 million was due to a payment for the purchase of assets related to the management of the BP Funds made in the prior period. 

 The decrease in cash used for financing activities of 20.2 million was due primarily to the prepayment of the remaining outstanding balance payable under our term loan agreement with U.S. Bank National Association in the prior period. 

 Dividend Payments
. We have consistently paid dividends each year since 2005. Our quarterly dividend rate remained constant during fiscal years 2020 and 2021, and our dividend payments totaled 4.0 million in each such fiscal year. 
 Our Bank Loan
. On March 26, 2020, we prepaid in full all principal, accrued interest, and costs and expenses outstanding under our term loan agreement with U.S. Bank National Association. The aggregate prepayment amount of 15.4 million was funded by cash on hand, and we did not incur any prepayment penalties. 
 2026 Notes
. On October 20, 2021, we completed a public offering of 4.875 notes due 2026 in the aggregate principal amount of 40,250,000, which included the full exercise of the underwriters overallotment option. The 2026 Notes bear interest at 4.875 per annum, payable on the last day of each calendar quarter and at maturity, beginning December 31, 2021. The 2026 Notes mature on December 31, 2026. 
 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES 

Our financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, which require the use of estimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. These accounting policies, methods, and estimates are an integral part of the financial statements prepared by management and are based upon management s current judgments. Those judgments are normally based on knowledge and experience with regard to past and current events and assumptions about future events. Certain accounting policies, methods, and estimates are particularly sensitive because of their significance to the financial statements and because future events affecting them may differ markedly from management s current judgment. Described below are the accounting policies that we believe are most critical to understanding our results of operations and financial position. 

 Our operating revenues consist of contractual investment advisory and shareholder service fees. We earn our investment advisory fees through portfolio management of the Hennessy Funds, and we earn our shareholder service fees by assisting investors in purchases, sales, distribution, and customer service. These fee revenues are earned and calculated daily by the Hennessy Funds accountants. In accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB guidance on revenue recognition, we recognize fee revenues monthly. Our contractual agreements provide persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists with fixed and determinable fees, and the services are rendered daily. The collectability is probable as the fees are received from the Hennessy Funds in the month subsequent to the month in which the services are provided.

Table of Contents 
 The management contracts we have purchased are considered intangible assets with an indefinite life and we account for them in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification 350: Intangibles Goodwill and Other ASC 350 ). Pursuant to ASC 350, an entity first assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative impairment test. The more-likely-than-not
 threshold is defined as having a likelihood of more than 50 percent. If an entity determines that it is more likely than not that an indefinite-lived
 intangible asset is impaired, then it must conduct an impairment analysis. We were able to forego the annual impairment analysis for fiscal year 2021 as the more-likely-than-not
 threshold was not met as of the end of fiscal year 2021. 
 The costs related to our purchase of the assets related to the management of mutual funds are capitalized as incurred. The costs are defined as an intangible asset per the FASB standard Intangibles Goodwill and Other. The acquisition costs include legal fees, fees for soliciting shareholder approval, and a percent of asset costs to purchase the management contracts. The amounts are included in the management contracts asset, totaling 80.6 million as of the end of fiscal year 2021. 

 RECENTLY ISSUED AND ADOPTED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS 

We reviewed accounting pronouncements issued between December 1, 2020, the filing date of our most recent previously filed Annual Report on Form 10-K,
 and November 24, 2021, the filing date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K,
 and have determined that no accounting pronouncement issued would have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations, or disclosures. 
 There have been no other significant changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates during fiscal year 2021.

 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 

To the Stockholders and Board of Directors 

 of Hennessy Advisors, Inc.: 

 Opinion on the Financial Statements 

We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Hennessy Advisors, Inc. (the Company as of September 30, 2021 and 2020, the related statements of income, changes in stockholders equity and cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended September 30, 2021, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements ). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of September 30, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended September 30, 2021, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 

 Basis for Opinion 

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

 Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

 Critical Audit Matters 

The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the account or disclosures to which it relates. 

 Valuation of Management Contract Assets Impairment Consideration

As described in Note 1(f) to the financial statements, the Company has historically capitalized the cost of purchasing management contracts as intangible assets. These intangible assets are considered to have indefinite useful lives and are therefore not amortized, but rather tested at least annually for impairment. As part of this annual test, management (i) evaluates whether events and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that impairment exists, and/or (ii) estimates the fair value of such intangible assets and compares it to the cost of the assets to determine whether impairment has occurred. Management s estimate of the fair value of management contract assets involves subjective assumptions that include stock market returns and weighted average cost of capital. 

40 

Table of Contents 
 We have determined that the valuation of management contract assets constitutes a critical audit matter for the following reasons: (i) it is a matter that should be communicated to the audit committee, since it involves a significant management estimate; (ii) it involves a material account balance; and (iii) it involves especially subjective auditor judgment. 

 We have addressed this critical audit matter by performing appropriate audit procedures. These procedures included (i) performing an independent evaluation of whether events or circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that impairment exists; (ii) evaluating the reasonableness of management s fair value estimate assumptions; and (iii) testing the mathematical accuracy of management s valuation model. Professionals with specialized skills and knowledge were used to assist in evaluating of the measurement of the Company s estimated fair value of the management contract assets.

 As provided in each investment advisory agreement, the Company receives investment advisory fees monthly based on a percentage of the applicable fund s average daily net asset value. 

 The Company has entered into sub-advisory
 agreements for the Hennessy Focus Fund, the Hennessy Equity and Income Fund, the Hennessy BP Energy Transition Fund, the Hennessy BP Midstream Fund, the Hennessy Japan Fund, and the Hennessy Japan Small Cap Fund. Under each of these sub-advisory
 agreements, the sub-advisor
 is responsible for the investment of the assets of the applicable Hennessy Fund in accordance with the terms of such agreement and the applicable Hennessy Fund s Prospectus and Statement of Additional Information. The sub-advisors
 are subject to the direction, supervision, and control of the Company and the Funds Board of Trustees. The sub-advisory
 agreements must be renewed annually (except in limited circumstances) in the same manner as, and are subject to the same termination provisions as, the investment advisory agreements. 
 In exchange for the sub-advisory

 . The renewed lease expires on . The lease renewal created a long-term operating lease as of March 31, 2021, and the Company recorded a right-of-use

 asset of million on the balance sheet. Right-of-use

 assets represent the Company s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and operating lease liabilities represent the Company s obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating lease right-of-use

 assets and liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. In determining the present value of lease payments, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate based on th e
 information available at the lease commencement date. 
The Company s lease terms ma y
 include options to extend the lease when it is reasonably certain that it will exercise any such options. For its leases, the Company concluded that it is not reasonably certain that any renewal options would be exercised, so the amounts are not recognized as part of operating lease right-of-use

 assets or operating lease liabilities. Leases with initial terms of 12 months or less and certain office equipment leases that are deemed insignificant are not recorded on the balance sheet and are expensed as incurred and included within rent expense under general and administrative expense. Lease expense related to operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the expected lease terms.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

MANAGEMENT S ANNUAL REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING 

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f)
 of the Exchange Act. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

 Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2021, using the criteria set forth in 2013 Internal Control Integrated Framework 2013 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this assessment, our management concluded that, as of September 30, 2021, the Company s internal control over financial reporting was effective based on those criteria. 

 EVALUATION OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined under Rule 13a-15(e)
 and 15d-15(e)
 of the Exchange Act, as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on such evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2021, were effective to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by us in reports filed under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and (ii) accumulated and communicated to management, including the principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

 DESCRIPTION OF THE NOTES 
 The following description of our 4.875 notes due 2026 (the Notes summarizes certain material terms of the Notes. This
description is qualified in its entirety by reference to the base indenture (as defined below) and supplemental indenture (as defined below), which are filed as exhibits to the Annual Report on Form 10-K of
which this Exhibit 4.1 is a part. The Notes were issued under, and are governed by, an indenture, dated as of October 20, 2021 (the
 base indenture ), as supplemented by the first supplemental indenture, dated as of October 20, 2021 (the supplemental indenture ), entered into between us and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee (the
 trustee (the base indenture, together with the supplemental indenture, the indenture ). General, Principal and Interest 
 On October 20, 2021, we completed a public offering of 40,250,000 aggregate principal amount of the 2026 Notes. The Notes
mature on December 31, 2026. The principal payable at maturity will be 100 of the aggregate principal amount. The interest rate of the Notes is 4.875 per year and will be paid every March 31, June 30, September 30, and
December 31, beginning December 31, 2021, and the regular record dates for interest payments will be every March 15, June 15, September 15, and December 15 beginning December 15, 2021. If an interest payment date
falls on a non-business day, the applicable interest payment will be made on the next business day and no additional interest will accrue as a result of such delayed payment. The initial interest period will
be the period from and including October 20, 2021, to, but excluding, the initial interest payment date, and the subsequent interest periods will be the periods from and including an interest payment date to, but excluding, the next interest
payment date or the stated maturity date, as the case may be. The indenture does not limit the amount of debt (including secured debt)
that may be issued by us or our subsidiaries under the indenture or otherwise, but does contain a covenant regarding our maintenance of a certain net consolidated debt to equity ratio. See Covenants below. Other than restrictions
described under Merger or Consolidation below, the indenture does not contain any covenants or other provisions designed to afford holders of the Notes protection in the event of a highly leveraged transaction involving us or if
our credit rating declines as the result of a takeover, recapitalization, highly leveraged transaction, or similar restructuring involving us. 

Covenants 
 In addition to standard covenants relating to payment of principal and interest, maintaining an office where payments may be made or securities
can be surrendered for payment, and related matters, the following covenants apply to the Notes: 

If, at any time, we are not subject to the reporting requirements of Sections 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act to
file any periodic reports with the SEC, we agree to furnish to holders of the Notes and the trustee, for the period of time during which the Notes are outstanding, our audited annual consolidated financial statements, within 90 days of our fiscal
year end, and unaudited interim consolidated financial statements, within 45 days of our fiscal quarter end (other than our fourth fiscal quarter). All such financial statements will be prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with GAAP.
 GAAP means generally accepted accounting principles in effect from time to time in the United States; provided, notwithstanding the foregoing, if any change in such generally accepted accounting principles or in the application thereof
after the issue date would affect the computation of any financial ratio or requirement set forth in the Notes or the indenture, then we may deliver notice to the trustee that such change will not apply for any determinations thereafter under the
Notes or the indenture. 

We agree to not permit the Net Consolidated Debt to Equity Ratio, measured as of the last day of each fiscal
quarter, to be greater than 2 to 1. Net Consolidated Debt to Equity Ratio means the ratio of Net Consolidated Debt to our total shareholders equity as shown on our most recent consolidated balance sheet. Net Consolidated
Debt means, as of any determination date, without duplication, an amount equal to (a) the aggregate principal amount of outstanding indebtedness for borrowed money of us and our subsidiaries, plus (b) Capital Lease Obligations we
and/or our subsidiaries may have outstanding as of such date, minus (c) the aggregate amount of cash and cash equivalents included on our most recent consolidated balance sheet; provided that the cash proceeds of any proposed incurrence of
indebtedness shall not be included in this clause (c) for purposes of calculating Net Consolidated Debt; provided further that Net Consolidated Debt shall not include (1) any indebtedness that has been defeased, discharged,
and/or redeemed, provided that funds in an amount equal to all such indebtedness (including interest and any other amounts required to be paid to the holders thereof in order to give effect to such defeasance, discharge or redemption) have been
irrevocably deposited with a trustee or agent for the benefit of the relevant holders of such indebtedness, (2) interest, fees, make-whole amounts, premium, charges, or expenses, if any, relating to the principal amount of Net Consolidated
Debt, and (3) any indebtedness owing to us by any subsidiary or any indebtedness owing to any subsidiary by us or another subsidiary. Capital Lease Obligation means, at the time any determination thereof is to be made, the amount of
the liability in respect of a capital lease that would at such time be required to be capitalized and reflected as a liability on a balance sheet (excluding the footnotes thereto) in accordance with GAAP; provided that obligations of us or any
subsidiaries we may acquire or establish in the future, or of a special purpose or other entity not consolidated with us and any subsidiaries we may acquire or establish in the future that (x) initially were not included on our consolidated
balance sheet as capital lease obligations and were subsequently characterized as capital lease obligations or, in the case of such a special purpose or other entity becoming consolidated with us and our subsidiaries were required to be
characterized as capital lease obligations upon such consolidation, in either case, due to a change in accounting treatment or otherwise, or (y) did not exist on the issue date and were required to be characterized as capital lease obligations
but would not have been required to be treated as capital lease obligations on the issue date had they existed at that time, shall for all purposes not be treated as Capital Lease Obligations; provided further, notwithstanding the foregoing,
 Capital Lease Obligations shall not include obligations relating to a lease that was (or would be) classified and accounted for by us and our subsidiaries as an operating lease under GAAP as in effect prior to the effectiveness of
Accounting Standards Codification 842. Optional Redemption 
 The Notes may be redeemed in whole or in part at any time or from time to time at our option on or after December 31, 2023, upon not less
than 30 days nor more than 60 days written notice by mail prior to the date fixed for redemption thereof, at a redemption price of 100 of the outstanding principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest
payments otherwise payable thereon for the then-current quarterly interest period accrued to, but excluding, the date fixed for redemption. 
 If we redeem only some of the Notes, the trustee or, with respect to global securities, DTC, will determine the method for selection of the
particular Notes to be redeemed, in accordance with the indenture and in accordance with the rules of any national securities exchange or quotation system on which the Notes are listed. Unless we default in payment of the redemption price, on and
after the date of redemption, interest will cease to accrue on the Notes called for redemption. 

Conversion and Exchange 
 The Notes are not convertible into or exchangeable for other securities. 
 Events of Default An event of
default with respect to the Notes occurs if: 

we do not pay the principal of any Note when due and payable at maturity; 

we do not pay interest on any Note when due and payable, and such default is not cured within 30 days of its due
date; 

we remain in breach of any other covenant in respect of the Notes for 60 days after we receive a written notice
of default stating we are in breach (the notice must be sent by either the trustee or holders of at least 25 of the principal amount of the outstanding Notes (with a copy to the Trustee)); or 

we file for bankruptcy or certain other events of bankruptcy, insolvency, or reorganization occur and remain
undischarged or unstayed for a period of 90 days. If an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the trustee or
the holders of not less than 25 in principal amount of the Notes (with a copy to the trustee) may declare the entire principal amount of all the Notes to be due and immediately payable, but this does not entitle any holder of Notes to any
redemption payout or redemption premium. This is called a declaration of acceleration of maturity. In certain circumstances, a declaration of acceleration of maturity may be canceled by the holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes if
(1) we have deposited with the trustee all amounts due and owing with respect to the Notes (other than principal or any payment that has become due solely by reason of such acceleration) and certain other amounts, and (2) any other Events
of Default have been cured or waived. Merger or Consolidation 
 Under the terms of the indenture, we are generally permitted to consolidate or merge with another entity. We are also permitted to sell all or
substantially all of our assets to another entity. However, we may not take any of these actions unless all the following conditions are met: 

where we merge out of existence or convey or transfer our assets substantially as an entirety, the resulting
entity must agree to be legally responsible for our obligations under the Notes; 

immediately after giving effect to the transaction, no default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be
continuing; and 

we must deliver certain certificates and documents to the trustee. 
 Modification or Waiver There are three
types of changes we can make to the indenture and the Notes issued thereunder. Changes Requiring the Approval of the Noteholders 
 First, there are changes that we cannot make to the Notes without approval from each holder directly and adversely affected thereby. The
following is a list of those types of changes: 

changing the stated maturity of the principal of (or premium, if any, on) or any installment of principal of or
interest on the Notes; 

reducing any amounts due on the Notes or reduce the rate of interest on the Notes; 

reducing the amount of principal payable upon acceleration of the maturity of a Note during the continuance of an
Event of Default; 

changing the place or currency of payment on a Note; 

impairing noteholders right to sue for payment in respect of a Note; 

reducing the percentage of holders of Notes whose consent is needed to modify or amend the indenture; and

reducing the percentage of holders of Notes whose consent is needed to waive compliance with certain provisions
of the indenture or to waive certain defaults or reduce the percentage of holders of Notes required to satisfy quorum or voting requirements at a meeting of holders of the Notes. 
 Changes Not Requiring Approval of the Noteholders 
 The second type of change does not require any vote by the holders of the Notes. This type is limited to clarifications and certain other
changes that would not adversely affect holders of the Notes in any material respect. Changes Requiring Majority Approval 
 Any other change to the indenture and the Notes would require the following approval: 

if the change affects only the Notes, it must be approved by the holders of a majority in principal amount of the
Notes; and 

if the change affects more than one series of debt securities issued under the same indenture, it must be
approved by the holders of a majority in principal amount of all of the series affected by the change, with all affected series voting together as one class for this purpose. 
 In each case, the required approval must be given by written consent. The holders of a majority in principal amount of all of the series of
debt securities issued under the indenture, voting together as one class for this purpose, may waive our compliance with some of our covenants in that indenture. However, we cannot obtain a waiver of a payment default or of any of the matters
covered by the bullet points included above under Changes Requiring Approval of the Noteholders. Satisfaction and Discharge 
 The indenture will be discharged and will cease to be of further effect with respect to the Notes when: 

either: 

all the Notes that have been authenticated have been delivered to the trustee for cancellation; or

all the Notes that have not been delivered to the trustee for cancellation: 

have become due and payable, or 

will become due and payable at their stated maturity within one year, or 

are to be called for redemption within one year, 

and we, in the case of the first, second and third sub-bullets above,
have irrevocably deposited or caused to be deposited with the trustee as trust funds in trust solely for the benefit of the holders of the Notes, in amounts as will be sufficient, to pay and discharge the entire indebtedness (including all
principal, premium, if any, and interest) on such Notes not previously delivered to the trustee for cancellation (in the case of Notes that have become due and payable on or prior to the date of such deposit) or to the stated maturity or redemption
date, as the case may be; 

we have paid or caused to be paid all other sums payable by us under the indenture with respect to the Notes; and

we have delivered to the trustee an officers certificate and legal opinion, each stating that all
conditions precedent provided for in the indenture relating to the satisfaction and discharge of the indenture and the Notes have been complied with. 
 Defeasance The following provisions will
be applicable to the Notes. Defeasance means that, by depositing with a trustee an amount of cash and/or government securities sufficient to pay all principal and interest, if any, on the Notes when due and satisfying any additional
conditions noted below, we will be deemed to have been discharged from our obligations under the Notes. In the event of a covenant defeasance, upon depositing such funds and satisfying similar conditions discussed below, we would be
released from certain covenants under the indenture relating to the Notes. Covenant Defeasance 
 Under the indenture, we can make the deposit described below and be released from some of the restrictive covenants in the indenture under
which the Notes were issued. This is called covenant defeasance. In that event, noteholders would lose the protection of those restrictive covenants but would gain the protection of having money and government securities set aside in
trust to repay the Notes. In order to achieve covenant defeasance, the following must occur: 

since the Notes are denominated in U.S. dollars, we must deposit in trust for the benefit of all holders of the
Notes a combination of cash and U.S. government or U.S. government agency notes or bonds that will generate enough cash to make interest, principal and any other payments on the Notes on their various due dates; 

we must deliver to the trustee a legal opinion of our counsel confirming that, under current U.S. federal income
tax law, we may make the above deposit without causing noteholders to be taxed on the Notes any differently than if we did not make the deposit; 

we must deliver to the trustee a legal opinion and officers certificate stating that all conditions
precedent to covenant defeasance have been complied with; 

defeasance must not result in a breach or violation of, or result in a default under, the indenture or any of our
other material agreements or instruments; and 

no default or Event of Default with respect to the Notes shall have occurred and be continuing and no defaults or
Events of Default related to bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization shall occur during the next 90 days. If we
accomplish covenant defeasance, noteholders can still look to us for repayment of the Notes if there were a shortfall in the trust deposit or the trustee is prevented from making payment. In fact, if one of the remaining Events of Default occurred
(such as our bankruptcy) and the Notes became immediately due and payable, there might be a shortfall. Depending on the event causing the default, noteholders may not be able to obtain payment of the shortfall. 

Full Defeasance 
 The Notes are subject to full defeasance. Full defeasance means that we can legally release ourselves from all payment and other obligations on
the Notes, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, including, but not limited to that (a) we have received from, or there has been published by, the Internal Revenue Service, or the IRS, a ruling, or (b) there is a change in
U.S. federal income tax law, in either case to the effect that the holders of the Notes and any coupons appertaining thereto will not recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result of such defeasance and will be
subject to U.S. federal income tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such defeasance had not occurred (called full defeasance ), and that we put in place the following other
arrangements for noteholders to be repaid: 

since the Notes are denominated in U.S. dollars, we must deposit in trust for the benefit of all holders of the
Notes a combination of money and U.S. government or U.S. government agency notes or bonds that will generate enough cash to make interest, principal, and any other payments on the Notes on their various due dates; 

we must deliver to the trustee a legal opinion confirming that there has been a change in current
U.S. federal tax law or an IRS ruling that allows us to make the above deposit without causing noteholders to be taxed on the Notes any differently than if we did not make the deposit; 

we must deliver to the trustee a legal opinion and officers certificate stating that all conditions
precedent to defeasance have been complied with; 

defeasance must not result in a breach or violation of, or constitute a default under, the indenture or any of
our other material agreements or instruments; and 

no default or Event of Default with respect to the Notes shall have occurred and be continuing and no defaults or
Events of Default related to bankruptcy, insolvency, or reorganization shall occur during the next 90 days. If we ever
did accomplish full defeasance, as described above, noteholders would have to rely solely on the trust deposit for repayment of the Notes. Noteholders could not look to us for repayment in the unlikely event of any shortfall. Conversely, the trust
deposit would most likely be protected from claims of our lenders and other creditors if we ever became bankrupt or insolvent. Governing Law 
 The indenture and the Notes will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York. 
 Indenture Provisions - Ranking 
 The Notes are our direct unsecured obligations and rank: 

pari passu with any of our existing and future unsecured, unsubordinated indebtedness;

senior to any of our future indebtedness that expressly provides it is subordinated to the Notes;

effectively subordinated to all of our existing and future secured indebtedness (including indebtedness that is
initially unsecured to which we subsequently grant security), to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness; and 

structurally subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and other obligations of any future
subsidiaries of ours. 

The Trustee under the Indenture 
 U.S. Bank National Association serves as the trustee, paying agent, and security registrar under the indenture. 
 Book-Entry Procedures The Notes
were issued in book-entry form and are represented by global notes deposited and registered in the name of DTC or its nominee. Except as set forth in this description, certificated notes will not be issued in exchange for beneficial interests in the
global notes. The Notes will be issued as fully registered securities registered in the name of Cede Co. (DTC s partnership nominee) or such other name as may be requested by an authorized representative of DTC. One fully registered
certificate will be issued for each issuance of the Notes, in the aggregate principal amount thereof, and will be deposited with DTC.
