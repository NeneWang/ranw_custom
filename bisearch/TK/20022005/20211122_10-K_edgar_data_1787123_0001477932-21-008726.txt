Page | 4 Table of Contents As of August 31, 2021, our accumulated deficit was 35,813. We expect we will require additional capital to meet our long-term operating requirements.

General and administrative and professional fee expenses incurred generally related to corporate overhead, financial and administrative contracted services, such as legal and accounting and developmental costs. Our net loss for the year ended August 31, 2021 was 29,503 compared to 5,332 for the year ended August 31, 2020. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES As at August 31, 2021 our current assets were 5,169 compared to 27,634 in current assets at August 31, 2020.

Page | 5 Table of Contents PLAN OF OPERATION AND FUNDING We expect that working capital requirements will continue to be funded through a combination of our existing funds and further issuances of securities. Our working capital requirements are expected to increase in line with the growth of our business. Existing working capital, further advances and debt instruments, and anticipated cash flow are expected to be adequate to fund our operations over the next six months. We have no lines of credit or other bank financing arrangements. Generally, we have financed operations to date through the proceeds of the private placement of equity and debt instruments. In connection with our business plan, management anticipates additional increases in operating expenses and capital expenditures relating to: (i) developmental expenses associated with a start-up business and (ii) marketing expenses. We intend to finance these expenses with further issuances of securities, and debt issuances. Thereafter, we expect we will need to raise additional capital and generate revenues to meet long-term operating requirements. Additional issuances of equity or convertible debt securities will result in dilution to our current shareholders. Further, such securities might have rights, preferences or privileges senior to our common stock. Additional financing may not be available upon acceptable terms, or at all. If adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms, we may not be able to take advantage of prospective new business endeavors or opportunities, which could significantly and materially restrict our business operations. MATERIAL COMMITMENTS As of the date of this Annual Report, we do not have any material commitments. PURCHASE OF SIGNIFICANT EQUIPMENT We do not intend to purchase any significant equipment during the next twelve months. OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS As of the date of this Annual Report, we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors.

Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm F-1 Balance Sheets as of August 31, 2021 and August 31, 2020 F-2 Statements of Operations for the years ended August 31, 2021 and August 31, 2020 F-3 Statement of Changes in Stockholders Equity for the years ended August 31, 2021 and August 31, 2020 F-4 Statements of Cash Flows for the years ended August 31, 2021 and August 31, 2020 F-5 Notes to the Financial Statements F-6 -F-9 Page | 7 Table of Contents REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the shareholders and the Board of Directors of Azar International Corp. Opinion on the Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Azar International Corp. ("the Company") as of August 31, 2021 and 2020, the related statements of operations, stockholder's equity, and cash flows, for each of the two years in the period ended August 31, 2021 and the related notes (collectively referred to as the "financial statements"). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of August 31, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended August 31, 2021, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Material Uncertainty Relating to Going Concern The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, the Company had not yet established an ongoing source of revenue sufficient to cover its operating costs and allow it to continue as a going concern. The Company had accumulated loss of 35,813 since inception (September 20, 2018) to August 31, 2021. These factors among others raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management's plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 2 to the financial statements. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. Our opinion is not modified with respect to this matter. Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) ("PCAOB") and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit Matters Critical audit matters are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. We determined that there are no critical audit matters. /s/ Zia Masood Kiani Co. Zia Masood Kiani Co. (Chartered Accountants) We have served as the Company's auditor since 2019.

F-5 Table of Contents AZAR INTERNATIONAL CORP. NOTES TO THE AUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED AUGUST 31, 2021 NOTE 1 ORGANIZATION AND BUSINESS AZAR INTERNATIONAL CORP. (the Company is a corporation established under the corporation laws in the State of Nevada on September 20, 2018. Azar International Corp. is in the tourism business. The Company has adopted August 31 fiscal year end. NOTE 2 GOING CONCERN The Company s financial statements as of August 31, 2021 have been prepared using generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America applicable to a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has not yet established an ongoing source of revenues sufficient to cover its operating costs and allow it to continue as a going concern. The Company has accumulated loss from inception (September 20, 2018) to August 31, 2021 of 35,813. These factors among others raise substantial doubt about the ability of the company to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time. During the quarter ended August 31, 2021, the Company was negatively impacted by the effects of the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic. The Company s business is tourism in the Dominican Republic. Border closer, travel bans and quarantine place doubt on the Company s revenue, which could result in continued losses. In order to continue as a going concern, the Company will need, among other things, additional capital resources. Management s plan is to obtain such resources for the Company by obtaining capital from management and significant shareholders sufficient to meet its minimal operating expenses and seeking third party equity and/or debt financing. However, management cannot provide any assurances that the Company will be successful in accomplishing any of its plans. These financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. NOTE 3 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Basis of Presentation The financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America. New Accounting Pronouncements There were various accounting standards and interpretations issued recently, none of which are expected to a have a material impact on our financial position, operations or cash flows. Cash and Cash Equivalents For purposes of the statement of cash flows, the Company considers all highly liquid instruments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. The Company's bank accounts are deposited in insured institutions. The funds are insured up to 250,000. At August 31, 2021, the Company's bank deposits did not exceed the insured amounts. F-6 Table of Contents Stock-Based Compensation As of August 31, 2021, the Company has not issued any stock-based payments to its employees. Stock-based compensation is accounted for at fair value in accordance with ASC 718, when applicable. To date, the Company has not adopted a stock option plan and has not granted any stock options. Use of Estimates and Assumptions The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Due to the limited level of operations, the Company has not had to make material assumptions or estimates other than the assumption that the Company is a going concern. Fair Value of Financial Instruments ASC 825, Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments , requires disclosure of fair value information about financial instruments. ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. Fair value estimates discussed herein are based upon certain market assumptions and pertinent information available to management as of August 31, 2021. The respective carrying values of certain on-balance-sheet financial instruments approximate their fair values. These financial instruments include cash, accounts payable and related party loan payable. Fair values were assumed to approximate carrying values for these financial instruments since they are short term in nature and their carrying amounts approximate fair value. Income Taxes Income taxes are provided in accordance with ASC No. 740, Accounting for Income Taxes. A deferred tax asset or liability is recorded for all temporary differences between financial and tax reporting and net operating loss carry forwards. Deferred tax expense (benefit) results from the net change during the year of deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion of all of the deferred tax assets will be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment. Revenue Recognition We adopted Accounting Standards Codification ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers , and all related interpretations for recognition of our revenue from tours and services. Previously we recorded revenue based on ASC Topic 605. Adoption of new accounting standard did not have any material impact on our reported revenue. Revenue is recognized when the following criteria are met: - Identification of the contract, or contracts, with customer; - Identification of the performance obligations in the contract; - Determination of the transaction price; - Allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and - Recognition of revenue when, or as, we satisfy performance obligation. The Company has evaluated all the recent accounting pronouncements and determined that there are no other accounting pronouncements that will have a material effect on the Company s financial statements. F-7 Table of Contents Fixed Assets Fixed assets are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, if any. The cost comprises purchase price, borrowing costs, if capitalization criteria are met and directly attributable cost of bringing the asset to its working condition for the intended use. Any subsidy/reimbursement/contribution received for installation and acquisition of any fixed assets is shown as deduction in the year of receipt. Capital work- in progress is stated at cost. Subsequent expenditure related to an item of fixed assets is added to its book value only if it increases the future benefits from the existing asset beyond its previously assessed standard of performance. All other expenses on existing fixed assets, including day-to-day repairs and maintenance expenditure and cost of replacing parts, are charged to the Statement of Profit and Loss for the period during which such expenses are incurred. Gains or losses arising from de-recognition of fixed assets are measured as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the assets derecognized. The Company utilizes straight-line depreciation over the estimated useful life of the asset. Office Equipment 3 years Earnings per Share ASC No. 260, Earnings Per Share , specifies the computation, presentation and disclosure requirements for earnings (loss) per share for entities with publicly held common stock. The Company has adopted the provisions of ASC No. 260. Basic net loss per share amounts is computed by dividing the net loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per share are the same as basic earnings per share due to the lack of dilutive items in the Company. Risks and Uncertainties In December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus surfaced in China, which has and is continuing to spread throughout the world, including the United States and Dominican Republic. On January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) a Public Health Emergency of International Concern, and on March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization characterized the outbreak as a pandemic . The governors of New York, California and several other states, as well as mayors on many cities, have ordered their residents to cease traveling to non-essential jobs and to curtail all unnecessary travel, and to stay in their homes as much as possible in the coming weeks, as the nation confronts the escalating coronavirus outbreak, and similar restrictions have been recommended by the federal authorities and authorities in many other states and cities. The Company is not able to predict the ultimate impact that COVID -19 will have on its business; however, if the current economic conditions continue, the Company will be forced to significantly scale back its business operations and its growth plans, and could ultimately have a significant negative impact on the Company.
