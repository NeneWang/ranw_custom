PART I 

 Item 1. 
 Business . 

 (a) General Development
of Business . North European Oil Royalty Trust (the
"Trust") is a grantor trust which, on behalf of the owners of
beneficial interest in the Trust (the "unit owners"), holds overriding
royalty rights covering gas and oil production in certain concessions
or leases in the Federal Republic of Germany. The rights are held
under contracts with local German exploration and development
subsidiaries of ExxonMobil Corp. ("ExxonMobil") and the Royal
Dutch/Shell Group of Companies ("Royal Dutch/Shell Group"). Under
these contracts, the Trust receives various percentage royalties on
the proceeds of the sales of certain products from the areas involved.
At the present time, royalties are received for sales of gas well
gas, oil well gas, crude oil, condensate and sulfur. See Item 2 of
this Report for descriptions of the relationships of these companies
and certain of these contracts. 

 The royalty rights were
received by the Trust from North European Oil Company (the "Company")
upon dissolution of the Company in September 1975. The Company was
organized in 1957 as the successor to North European Oil Corporation
(the "Corporation"). The Trust is administered by trustees (the
"Trustees") under an Agreement of Trust dated September 10, 1975, as
amended (the "Trust Agreement"). 

 Neither the Trust nor the
Trustees on behalf of the Trust conduct any active business activities
or operations. The function of the Trustees is to monitor, verify,
collect, hold, invest and distribute the royalty payments made to the
Trust. Under the Trust Agreement, the Trustees make quarterly
distributions of the net funds received by the Trust on behalf of
the unit owners. Funds temporarily held by the Trust prior to their
distribution are invested in an interest bearing money market account. 

 There has been no significant
change in the principal operation or purpose of the Trust during the
past fiscal year. 

 As part of the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act of 2002 ("SOX"), the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC")
adopted rules implementing legislation concerning governance matters
for publicly held entities. The Trust is complying with the
requirements of the SEC and SOX and, at this time, the Trustees have
chosen not to request any relief from those provisions based on the
passive nature of the Trust but may do so in the future. In that
connection, the Trustees have directed that certain of the additional
statements and disclosures set forth or incorporated by reference in
this Report, which the SEC requires of corporations, be made even
though some of such statements and disclosures might not now or in
the future be required to be made by the Trust. 

 In addition, the New York
Stock Exchange (the "NYSE"), where units of beneficial interest of
the Trust are listed for trading, has additional corporate governance
rules as set forth in Section 303A of the NYSE Listed Company Manual.
Most of the governance requirements promulgated by the NYSE are not
applicable to the Trust, which is a passive entity acting as a
royalty trust and holds only overriding royalty rights. The Trustees
have, however, chosen to constitute an Audit Committee and a
Compensation Committee but may not necessarily continue to do so in
the future. 

 (b) Narrative
Description of Business . Under the Trust Agreement,
the Trust conducts no active business operations and is restricted
to collection of income from royalty rights and distribution to unit
owners of the net income after payment of administrative and
related expenses. 

 The overriding royalty
rights held by the Trust are derived from contracts and agreements
originally entered into by German subsidiaries of the predecessor
Corporation during the early 1930s. The Trust's primary royalty
rights are based on a government granted concession and remain in
effect as long as there are continued production activities and/or
exploration efforts within the concession. It is generally
anticipated that production activities will continue as long as
they remain economically profitable. The Trust holds other royalty
rights, which are based on
leases which have passed their original expiration dates. These
leases remain in effect as long as there is continued production or
the lessor does not cancel the lease. Individual lessors will
normally not seek termination of the rights originally granted
because the leases provide for royalty payments to the lessors if
sales of oil or gas result from discoveries made on the leased
land. Additionally, termination by individual lessors would result
in the escheat of mineral rights to the applicable state. 

 Royalties are paid to the
Trust on sales from production under these leases and concessions on a
regular monthly or quarterly basis pursuant to the royalty agreements.
The Trust receives the royalty payments exclusively in Euros. After
the royalties have been deposited in the Trust's account with
Deutsche Bank in Germany, sufficient funds are reserved to handle any
outstanding or anticipated expenses and maintain a minimal balance of
10,000 Euros. The Trust then transfers the remainder of Euro
denominated funds into United States ("U.S.") dollars based upon the
available exchange rates. Following this
conversion to U.S. dollars, the royalties are transferred
to the Trust's bank account in the U.S. The Trust does not engage in
activities to hedge against currency risk, and the fluctuations in the
conversion rate impact its financial results. Since the
actual royalty deposits are held as Euros for such a limited time, the
market risk with respect to these deposits is small. The Trust has not
experienced any difficulty in effecting the conversion of Euros into
U.S. dollars. 

 As the holder of overriding
royalty rights, the Trust has no legal ability, whether by contract or
operation of law, to compel production or exploration. Moreover, if
an operator should determine to terminate production in any concession
or lease area and to surrender the concession or lease, the royalty
rights for that area would thereby be terminated. Under certain
royalty agreements, it is a requirement that the Trust be advised of
any intention to surrender lease or concession rights. While the
Trust itself is precluded from undertaking any production activities,
possible residual rights might permit the Trust to take up a
surrendered concession or lease and attempt to retain a third-party
operator to develop such concession or lease. There is no assurance
that the Trust could find such a third party. 

 The exploration for and the
production of gas and oil is a speculative business. The Trust has no
means of ensuring continued income from its royalty rights at either
their present levels or otherwise. The Trust has no role in any of
the operating companies' decision-making processes, such as gas
pricing, gas sales or exploration, which can impact royalty income.
In addition, fluctuations in prices and supplies of gas and oil and
the effect these fluctuations might have on royalty income to the
Trust and on reserves net to the Trust cannot be accurately
projected. Finally, natural gas and crude oil are wasting assets.
While known reserves may increase as additional development adds
quantities to the reserve amount, the amount of known and unknown
reserves is finite and will decline over time. Given these factors,
along with the uncertainty in worldwide and local German economic
conditions and the fact that the Trustees have no information
beyond that information which is generally available to the public,
the Trustees make no projections regarding future royalty income. 

 While Germany has laws
relating to environmental protection, the Trustees do not
have detailed information concerning the present or possible effect
of such laws on operations in areas where the Trust holds royalty
rights on production and sale of products from those areas. The
Trustees were informed by the Trust's German consultant that on
July 8, 2016, a hydraulic fracturing ("fracking") law was passed in
Germany permitting fracking in sandstone at any depth. The law
requires that an environmental impact study be performed and that
permission by the relevant water authority be granted in order to
ensure the protection of drinking water supplies. Based upon an
analysis of the details of this law, the Trust's German consultant
has informed the Trust that fracking will be permitted in all
current productive zones within the Oldenburg concession (as
defined below) both due
to the depths involved and the nature of the productive zones.
However, the operating companies would still have to comply with
all regulatory requirements governing the use of fracking. The
failure by the operating companies to comply with all regulatory
requirements could affect the volume of gas, sulfur and oil
production by the operating companies and could adversely affect
the royalties paid to the Trust. 

 The Trust, in cooperation
with a parallel royalty owner (Unitarian Universalist Congregation
at Shelter Rock)("UUCSR")), arranges for periodic examinations of
the books and records of the operating companies to verify
compliance with the computation provisions of the applicable
agreements. As a cost savings measure, the royalty examination is
conducted on a biennial basis. From time to time, these
examinations disclose computational errors or errors from
inappropriate application of existing agreements and appropriate
adjustments are requested to be made. As a result of the
amendments to the Trust's royalty agreements which effect pricing
simplification (see Item 7 of this Report), examinations by the
Trust's German accountants have been simplified since these
examinations are primarily limited to the verification of the gas
quantities sold. Although these periodic examinations may also
disclose other matters that are subject to dispute between the
parties, these disputes have historically been resolved through
negotiations without the need for litigation. The Trust's
accountants in Germany began their examination of the operating
companies for calendar years 2019 and 2020 in November 2021 when the
final sales figures and the German Border Import gas Prices (see
Item 7 of this Report) were both available. 

 (c) Financial
Information about Geographic Areas . In Item 2 of this
Report, there is a schedule (by product, geographic area and
operating company) showing the royalty income received by the Trust
during the fiscal year ended October 31, 2021. 

 (d) Information
about our Trustees and
Executive Officers . As specified in the
Trust Agreement, the affairs of the Trust are managed by not more
than five individual Trustees who receive compensation determined
under that same agreement. One of the Trustees is designated as
Managing Trustee. Robert P. Adelman has served in a non-executive
capacity as Managing Trustee since November 1, 2006. 

 Ahron H. Haspel is
independent and has been determined to be a financial expert (both
as defined in the SEC rules). Mr. Haspel serves as Chairman for
the Audit and Compensation Committees. Lawrence A. Kobrin serves
as Clerk to the Trustees (a role similar to that of a corporate
secretary). For these services, these three individuals receive
additional compensation. 

 Day-to-day matters are
handled by the Managing Director, John R. Van Kirk, who also serves
as CEO and CFO. Mr. Van Kirk has held the position of
Managing Director of the Trust since November 1990. As a cost
saving measure, the Trust shifted to a virtual office in fiscal
2019. This shift has not impacted the operations or
administration of the Trust. In addition to the Managing
Director, the Trust has one administrative employee in the U.S.,
whose title is Administrator. The number of total employees of
the Trust is two, and the number of full-time employees is two. 

 The Trust and UUCSR have
retained the services of a consultant, an accounting firm
and a legal firm in Germany. The consultant has broad experience in
the petroleum industry and provides reports on a regular basis. The
accounting firm and the legal firm advise and represent as needed.
The Trust and the co-royalty holder share the costs of these services
in Germany. 

 (e) Available
Information . The Trust maintains a website at
http://www.neort.com. The Trust's Annual Reports, Form 10-K annual
reports, Form 10-Q quarterly reports and the Definitive Proxy
Statements are available through the Trust's website as soon as
reasonably practicable after such reports are filed with or furnished
to the SEC. Press releases and tax letters are available through the
website as soon as practicable after release. The North European
Oil Royalty Trust Agreement (as amended), the Trust's Code of
Conduct and Business Ethics, the Trustees' Regulations and the
Trust's Audit Committee Charter are also available through the
Trust's website. The Trust's website and the information contained
in it and connected to it shall not be deemed incorporated by
reference into this Form 10-K.

 Item 2. 
 Properties . 

 The properties of the Trust,
which the Trust and Trustees hold pursuant to the Trust Agreement on
behalf of the unit owners, are overriding royalty rights on sales of
gas, sulfur and oil under a concession in the Federal Republic of
Germany (the "Oldenburg concession"). The Oldenburg concession covers
approximately 1,386,000 acres, is located in the German federal state
of Lower Saxony, and is the area from which natural gas, sulfur and oil
are extracted. The Oldenburg concession currently provides nearly 100 
of all the royalties received by the Trust. The Oldenburg concession
is held by Mobil Erdgas-Erdol GmbH ("Mobil Erdgas"), a German operating
subsidiary of ExxonMobil, and by Oldenburgische Erdolgesellschaft
("OEG"). As a result of direct and indirect ownership, ExxonMobil owns
two-thirds of OEG and the Royal Dutch/Shell Group of Companies owns
one-third of OEG. BEB Erdgas und Erdol GmbH ("BEB"), a joint venture
in which ExxonMobil and the Royal Dutch/Shell Group each own 50 ,
administers the concession held by OEG. 

 In 2002, Mobil Erdgas and
BEB formed ExxonMobil Production Deutschland GmbH ("EMPG") to carry
out all exploration, drilling and production activities. All sales
activities upon which the calculation of royalties is based are still
handled by either Mobil Erdgas or BEB (the "operating companies"). 

 Under one set of rights
covering the western part of the Oldenburg concession (approximately
662,000 acres), the Trust receives a royalty payment of 4 on gross
receipts from sales by Mobil Erdgas of gas well gas, oil well gas,
crude oil and condensate (the "Mobil Agreement"). Under the Mobil
Agreement there is no deduction of costs prior to the calculation of
royalties from gas well gas and oil well gas, which together account
for approximately 99 of all the royalties under said agreement.
Historically, the Trust has received significantly greater royalty
payments under the Mobil Agreement (as compared to the OEG Agreement
described below) due to the higher royalty rate specified by that
agreement. 

 The Trust is also entitled
under an agreement with Mobil Erdgas to receive a 2 royalty on gross
receipts of sales of sulfur obtained as a by-product of sour gas
produced from the western part of Oldenburg (the "Mobil Sulfur
Agreement"). The payment of the sulfur royalty is conditioned upon
sales of sulfur by Mobil Erdgas at a selling price above an agreed upon
base price. This base price is adjusted annually by an inflation index.
When the average quarterly selling price falls below the indexed base
price, no sulfur royalties are paid by Mobil Erdgas. Sulfur royalties
under the Mobil Agreement totaled 178,367 and 71,280 during fiscal
2021 and 2020, respectively. 

 Under another set of rights
covering the entire Oldenburg concession and pursuant to the agreement
with OEG, the Trust receives royalties at the rate of 0.6667 on gross
receipts from sales by BEB of gas well gas, oil well gas, crude oil,
condensate and sulfur (removed during the processing of sour gas) less
a certain allowed deduction of costs (the "OEG Agreement"). Under the
OEG Agreement, 50 of the field handling and treatment costs as
reported for state royalty purposes are deducted from the gross sales
receipts prior to the calculation of the royalty to be paid to the
Trust.

Exhibit 99.1 to this Report
is a report entitled Calculation of Cost Depletion Percentage for
the 2021 Calendar Year Based on the Estimate of Remaining Proved
Producing Reserves in the Northwest Basin of the Federal Republic of
Germany as of October 1, 2021 (the "Cost Depletion Report"). The
Cost Depletion Report, dated November 23, 2021, was prepared by
Graves & Co. Consulting, LLC, 2777 Allen Parkway, Suite 525,
Houston, Texas 77019 ("Graves & Co."). Graves & Co. is an
independent petroleum and natural gas consulting organization
specialized in analyzing hydrocarbon reserves.

The Cost Depletion Report
provides documentation supporting the calculation of the cost
depletion percentage for the 2021 calendar year based on the use of
certain production data and the estimated net proved producing
reserves as of October 1, 2021 for the primary area in which the
Trust holds overriding royalty rights. In order to permit timely
filing of the Cost Depletion Report and consistent with the practice
of the Trust in prior years, the information has been prepared for
the 12-month period ended September 30, 2021. While this is one
month prior to the end of the fiscal year of the Trust, the
information available for production and sales through the end of
September is the most complete information available at a date
early enough to permit the timely preparation of the various
reports required. Unit owners are referred to the full text of the
Cost Depletion Report contained herein for further details. 

 The cost depletion percentage
is prepared by Graves & Co. for the Trust's unit owners for tax
reporting purposes. The cost depletion percentage in that report for
calendar 2021 is 17.7008 . Specific details relative to the Trust's
income and expenses and cost depletion percentage as they apply to
the calculation of taxable income for the 2021 calendar year are
included on removable pages in the 2021 Annual Report. Additionally,
the tax reporting information for 2021 is available on the Trust's
website, http://www.neort.com/tax-letters.html. 

 The primary purpose of the
Cost Depletion Report is the preparation of the cost depletion
percentage for use by unit owners in their own tax reporting. The
only information provided to the Trust that can be utilized in the
calculation of the cost depletion percentage is current and
historical production and sales of proved producing reserves. For
the western half of the Oldenburg concession, the Trust receives
quarterly production and sales information on a well-by-well basis.
For the eastern half of the Oldenburg concession, the Trust receives
cumulative quarterly production and sales information on two general
areas. These general areas encompass numerous fields with varying
numbers of wells. Pursuant to the arrangements under which the
Trust holds royalty rights and the fact that the Trust is not
considered an operating company within Germany, the Trust has no
access to the operating companies' proprietary information
concerning producing field reservoir data. The Trustees have been
advised by their German counsel that publication of such information
is not required under applicable law in Germany and that the royalty
rights do not grant the Trust the right to require or compel the
release of such information. Efforts to obtain such
information from the operating companies have not been successful.
The information made available to the Trust by the operating
companies does not include any of the following: reserve estimates,
capitalized costs, production cost estimates, revenue projections,
producing field reservoir data (including pressure data, permeability,
porosity and thickness of producing zone) or other similar
information. While the limited information available to the Trust
permits the calculation of the cost depletion percentage, it does not
change the uncertainty with respect to the estimate of proved
producing reserves. In addition, it is impossible for the Trust or
its consultant to make estimates of proved undeveloped or probable
future net recoverable oil and gas by appropriate geographic
areas. 

 The Trust has the authority
to examine, but only for certain limited purposes, the operating
companies' sales and production from the royalty areas. The Trust
also has access to published materials in Germany from W.E.G. (a
German organization equivalent to the American Petroleum Institute
or the American Gas Association). The use of such statistical
information relating to production and sales necessarily involves
extrapolations and projections. Both Graves & Co. and the Trustees
believe the use of the material available is appropriate and
suitable for preparation of the cost depletion percentage and the
estimates described in the Cost Depletion Report. The Trustees and
Graves & Co. believe this report and these estimates to be reasonable
and appropriate but assume that these estimates may vary from
statistical estimates which could be made if reservoir production
information (of the kind normally available to producing companies
in the U.S.) were available. The limited information
available makes it inappropriate to make projections or estimates
of proved or probable reserves of any category or class other than
the estimated net proved producing reserves described in the Cost
Depletion Report. 

 Attachment A of the Cost
Depletion Report shows a schedule of estimated net proved producing
reserves of the Trust's royalty properties, computed as of
October 1, 2021 and a five-year schedule of gas, sulfur and oil
sales for the twelve months ended September 30, 2021, 2020, 2019,
2018 and 2017 computed from quarterly sales reports of operating
companies received by the Trust during such periods.

 Executive Summary 

 The Trust is a passive fixed
investment trust which holds overriding royalty rights, receives
income under those rights from certain operating companies, pays
its expenses and distributes the remaining net funds to its unit
owners. As mandated by the Trust Agreement, distributions of income
are made on a quarterly basis. These distributions, as determined
by the Trustees, constitute substantially all of the funds on hand
after provision is made for Trust expenses then anticipated. 

 The Trust does not engage in
any business or extractive operations of any kind in the areas over
which it holds royalty rights and is precluded from engaging in such
activities by the Trust Agreement. There are no requirements,
therefore, for capital resources with which to make capital
expenditures or investments in order to continue the receipt of
royalty revenues by the Trust. 

 The properties of the Trust
are described in Item 2. Properties of this Report. Of particular
importance with respect to royalty income are the two royalty
agreements, the Mobil Agreement and the OEG Agreement. The Mobil
Agreement covers gas sales from the western part of the Oldenburg
concession. The Trust has traditionally received the majority of its
royalty income under the Mobil Agreement due to the higher
royalty rate of 4 . The OEG Agreement covers gas sales from
the entire Oldenburg concession but the royalty rate of 0.6667 is
significantly lower and gas royalties have been correspondingly
lower. 

 The operating companies pay
monthly royalties to the Trust based on their sales of natural gas,
sulfur and oil. Of these three products, natural gas provided
approximately 90 of the total royalties in fiscal 2021. The amount
of royalties paid to the Trust is primarily based on four factors:
the amount of gas sold, the price of that gas, the area from which
the gas is sold and the exchange rate. For purposes of the royalty
calculations, the determination of the gas price is explained in
detail in the following three paragraphs. 

 On August 26, 2016, the
Mobil and OEG Agreements were amended to establish a new base to
determine gas prices for the calculation of the Trust's royalties
calculated. This new base is set as the state assessment base for
natural gas used by the operating companies in their calculation
of royalties payable to the State of Lower Saxony. This change
reflects a shift from the use of gas ex-field prices ("contractual
prices") to the prices calculated for the German Border Import gas
Price ("GBIP"). The average combined totals of the GBIP for the
relevant three-month period are used to provide an average gas
price for the quarter. This average gas price is increased by 1 
and 3 per the terms of the Mobil and OEG Royalty Agreements and
is used by the operators to calculate the royalties payable to the
Trust for a given quarter. 

 The change to the GBIP was
intended to be revenue neutral for the Trust in comparison to the
previous pricing methodology. Additionally, this change was intended
to reduce the scope and cost of the accounting examination, eliminate
ongoing disputes with OEG and Mobil regarding sales to related parties,
and reduce prior year adjustments to the normally scheduled year-end
reconciliation. The pricing basis has eliminated certain costs
(transportation and plant gas storage) that were previously deductible
prior to the royalty calculation under the OEG Agreement. 

 On approximately the 25th of
the months of January, April, July and October, the operating companies
calculate the volume of gas sold during the previous calendar
quarter. This volume of gas sold is then multiplied by the average
adjusted GBIP available at that time. Due to delays in the calculation
of the GBIP by the state, the most current GBIP is from a period
ending two months prior to the end of the relevant calendar quarter.
The respective royalty amount is divided into thirds and forms the
monthly royalty payments to the Trust (payable on the 15th of each
month) for the Trust's upcoming fiscal quarter. At the same time that
the operating companies determine the actual amount of royalties that
were payable for the prior calendar quarter, they look at the actual
amount of royalties that were paid to the Trust for that period and
calculate the difference between what was paid and what was payable.
Any positive adjustments are paid immediately and any negative
adjustments would be deducted from the royalty payment for the first
month of the next fiscal quarter. In September of the succeeding
calendar year, the operating companies make the final determination
of any necessary royalty adjustments for the prior calendar year with
a positive or negative adjustment made accordingly. These adjustments
are based on the final average GBIP for the preceding year applied to
the final calculation of the total volume of gas sold by the
operating companies during that year. 

 There are two types of
natural gas found within the Oldenburg concession, sweet gas and
sour gas. Sweet gas has little or no contaminants and needs no
treatment before it can be sold. Sour gas, in comparison, must be
processed at the Grossenkneten desulfurization plant before it can
be sold. The desulfurization process removes hydrogen sulfide and
other contaminants. The hydrogen sulfide in gaseous form is
converted to sulfur in a solid form, which is sold separately. With
full operation of the two units, raw gas input capacity stands at
approximately 400 million cubic feet ("MMcf") per day. As needed,
EMPG conducts maintenance on the plant generally during the summer
months when demand is lower. As part of the regular 10-year
scheduled maintenance, Grossenkneten underwent an overhaul from
September 8, 2020 through October 13, 2020. During this time the
plant was completely shut down and no sour gas was processed.
Since sour gas accounts for 75 of overall gas sales and 98 of
western gas sales, this shutdown significantly impacted royalty
income during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 and the first
quarter of fiscal 2021. 

 For unit owners, changes in
the U.S. dollar value of the Euro have an immediate impact. This
impact occurs at the time the royalties, which are paid to the
Trust in Euros, are converted into U.S. dollars at the applicable
exchange rate and transferred from Germany to the Trust's bank
account in the U.S. In relation to the U.S. dollar, a
stronger Euro would yield more U.S. dollars and a weaker Euro would
yield fewer U.S. dollars. 

 Seasonal demand factors
affect the income from the Trust's royalty rights insofar as they
relate to energy demands and increases or decreases in prices, but
on average they are generally not material to the annual income
received under the Trust's royalty rights. 

 The Trust has no means of
ensuring continued income from overriding royalty rights at their
present level or otherwise. The Trust's consultant in Germany
provides general information to the Trust on the German and European
economies and energy markets. This information provides a context
in which to evaluate the actions of the operating companies. The
Trust's consultant receives reports from EMPG with respect to
current and planned drilling and exploration efforts. However, EMPG
and the operating companies continue to limit the information flow
to that which is required by German law, and the Trust is not able
to confirm the accuracy of any of the information supplied by EMPG
or the operating companies. 

 The low level of
administrative expenses of the Trust limits the effect of inflation
on costs. Sustained price inflation would be reflected in sales
prices. Sales prices along with sales volumes form the basis on
which the royalties paid to the Trust are computed. 

 Results: Fiscal 2021 versus Fiscal
2020 

 For fiscal 2021, the Trust's
gross royalty income increased 13.64 to 4,602,410 from 4,050,017 in
fiscal 2020. The increase in the amount of royalty income resulted in
the higher distribution. The total distribution for fiscal 2021 was
 0.47 per unit compared to 0.32 per unit for fiscal 2020. Gas prices
and the average exchange rates under both royalty agreements were
higher while gas sales were down. The royalty income attributable to
gas sales under the Mobil Agreement in fiscal 2021 increased by
 195,626 as compared to fiscal 2020. Royalty income attributable to
gas sales under the OEG Agreement in fiscal 2021 increased by 156,179
as compared to fiscal 2020. 

 As in prior years, the Trust
receives adjustments from the operating companies based on their final
calculations of royalties payable during the previous periods. During
fiscal 2021, the adjustments based on royalties payable for 2020
decreased royalty income by 696,189. During fiscal 2020, the
adjustments based on royalties payable for 2017, 2018 and 2019 decreased
royalty income by 653,916. In fiscal 2021 and 2020, Mobil sulfur
royalties totaled 178,367 and 71,280, respectively. 

 Gas sales under the Mobil
Agreement decreased 8.33 to 15.821 Billion cubic feet ("Bcf") in fiscal
2021 from 17.259 Bcf in fiscal 2020. The most significant factor
resulting in the decrease in gas sales for 2021 was the continuing
negative impact of COVID-19 on the German, European and global economies.
In addition, according to the Trust's consultant in Germany, some portion
of the decline in gas production is due to the normal reduction in well
pressure that is experienced over time.

Excluding the effects of differences
in prices and average exchange rates, the combination of royalty rates on gas
sold from western Oldenburg results in an effective royalty rate approximately
seven times higher than the royalty rate on gas sold from eastern Oldenburg.
This is of particular significance to the Trust since gas sold from western
Oldenburg provides the bulk of royalties paid to the Trust. For fiscal 2021,
the volume of gas sold from western Oldenburg accounted for only 29.33 
of the volume of all gas sales. However, western Oldenburg gas royalties
provided approximately 79.98 or 3,326,874 out of a total of 4,159,420 in
overall Oldenburg gas royalties. 

 Gas sales under the OEG Agreement
decreased 3.39 to 53.947 Bcf in fiscal 2021 from 55.841 Bcf in fiscal 2020.
The most significant factor resulting in the decrease in gas sales for 2021 was
the continuing negative impact of COVID-19 on the German, European and global
economies. In addition, according to the Trust's consultant in Germany, some
portion of the decline in gas production is due to the normal reduction in well
pressure that is experienced over time.

Interest income for fiscal
2021 of 641 decreased from interest income of 2,853 for fiscal

 140,013, or 18.27 , to 626,494 in fiscal 2021 from 766,507 in fiscal
2020 due to reduced Trustees' fees as specified in the provisions of
the Trust Agreement, cost savings realized through the suspension of
in-person meetings due to the pandemic, lower legal expenses, lower
insurance costs and the absence of accounting costs associated with
the biennial examinations of the royalty calculations by the German
operating companies during fiscal 2021. 

 Report on Exploration and Drilling 

 The Trust's German consultant
periodically contacts the representatives of the operating companies to
inquire about their planned and proposed drilling and geophysical work
and other general matters. The following represents a summary of the
most recent information the Trust's German consultant received from
representatives of EMPG as of November 2021. The Trust is not able to
confirm the accuracy of any of the information supplied by the
operating companies. In addition, the operating companies are not
required to take any of the actions outlined and, if they change their
plans with respect to any such actions, they are not obligated to
inform the Trust. Information on wells that are not named or are in
preliminary planning stages is not divulged by EMPG. 

EMPG has not planned any new wells for calendar year
2022. On the exploration side, there has been no major work initiated.
Desktop studies are continuing to satisfy mining authorities. 

 The operator has performed a study, The Sour Gas Study,
dealing with all matters which could help to optimize the tail end
production from all sour gas wells in the gas fields of Oldenburg
concessions. The focus of the study was on how to optimize the gas
compression in the flowline grids from each well to the gathering
stations, compressor stations and finally towards the processing plant
in Grossenkneten. Some optimization potential has been found. 

 Grossenkneten plant operation will soon be reduced to
one train from the current two trains in parallel thus optimizing cost
and efficiency. 

 It is expected that the Trust's consultant will learn
additional details about The Sour Gas Study and its impact when he meets
EMPG in March 2022. 

Critical Accounting Policies 

 The financial statements,
appearing subsequently in this Report, present financial statement
balances and financial results on a modified cash basis of accounting,
which is a comprehensive basis of accounting other than accounting
principles generally accepted in the U.S. ("GAAP basis").
Cash basis accounting is an accepted accounting method for royalty
trusts such as the Trust. GAAP basis financial statements disclose
income as earned and expenses as incurred, without regard to receipts
or payments. The use of GAAP would require the Trust to accrue for
expected royalty payments. This is exceedingly difficult since the
Trust has very limited information on such payments until they are
received and cannot accurately project such amounts. The Trust's
cash basis financial statements disclose revenue when cash is
received and expenses when cash is paid. The one modification of
the cash basis of accounting is that the Trust accrues for
distributions to be paid to unit owners (those distributions
approved by the Trustees for the Trust). The Trust's distributable
income represents royalty income received by the Trust during the
period plus interest income less any expenses incurred by the Trust,
all on a cash basis. In the opinion of the Trustees, the use of the
modified cash basis provides a more meaningful presentation to unit
owners of the results of operations of the Trust and presents to the
unit owners a more accurate calculation of income and expenses for
tax reporting purposes. 

 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

 The Trust has no off-balance
sheet arrangements. 

This Report on Form 10-K may
contain forward-looking statements intended to qualify for the safe
harbor from liability established by the Private Securities Litigation
Reform Act of 1995. Such statements address future expectations and
events or conditions concerning the Trust. Many of these statements
are based on information provided to the Trust by the operating
companies or by consultants using public information sources. These
statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could
cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in any
forward-looking statements. These include: 

 risks and uncertainties
concerning levels of gas production and gas sale prices, 
general economic conditions and currency exchange rates; 

 the ability or willingness of the
operating companies to perform under their contractual
obligations with the Trust; 

 potential disputes with the
operating companies and the resolution thereof; and 

 the effects of the novel
coronavirus identified as COVID-19 on our financial
 results. 

All such factors are difficult
to predict, contain uncertainties that may materially affect actual
results, and are generally beyond the control of the Trust. New
factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for the Trust
to predict all such factors or to assess the impact of each such factor
on the Trust. Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date
on which such statement is made, and the Trust does not undertake any
obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect events or
circumstances after the date on which such statement is made. 

Item 7A. 
 Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk . 

 The Trust does not engage in
any trading activities with respect to possible foreign exchange
fluctuations. The Trust does not use any financial instruments to
hedge against possible risks related to foreign exchange
fluctuations. The market risk with respect to funds held in the
Trust's bank account in Germany is negligible because standing
instructions at the Trust's German bank require the bank to process
conversions and transfers of royalty payments as soon as possible
following their receipt. The Trust does not engage in any trading
activities with respect to commodity price fluctuations.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING
FIRM 

 To the Board of Trustees and the Unit Owners of 
North European Oil Royalty Trust 

 Opinion on the Financial
Statements 

 We have audited the accompanying statements of assets,
liabilities and trust corpus of North European Oil Royalty Trust (the
"Trust") as of October 31, 2021 and 2020, and the related statements of
revenue collected and expenses paid, undistributed earnings, and changes in
cash and cash equivalents for each of the two years in the period ended
October 31, 2021, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the
"financial statements"). In our opinion, the financial statements present
fairly, in all material respects, the assets, liabilities and trust corpus
of the Trust as of October 31, 2021 and 2020, and its revenue collected and
expenses paid, undistributed earnings and changes in its cash and cash
equivalents for each of the two years in the period ended October 31, 2021,
in conformity with the modified cash basis of accounting described in
Note 1. 

 Basis for Opinion 

 These financial statements are the responsibility of the
Trust's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Trust's
financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm
registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)
("PCAOB") and are required to be independent with respect to the Trust in
accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and
regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Trust is not required to have,
nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial
reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of
internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing
an opinion on the effectiveness of the Trust's internal control over financial
reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

 Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of
material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud,
and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included
examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion. 

 Basis of Accounting 

 As described in Note 1, these financial statements have been
prepared on the modified cash basis of accounting, which is a comprehensive basis
of accounting other than accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America.

 Critical Audit Matters 

 Critical audit matters are matters arising from the current period
audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be
communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures
that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially
challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. We determined that there are no
critical audit matters.

in accordance with the rules and regulations of the SEC. Financial
statement balances and financial results are presented on a modified
cash basis of accounting, which is a comprehensive basis of accounting
other than accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States ("GAAP basis"). In the opinion of management, all adjustments
that are considered necessary for a fair presentation of these
financial statements, including adjustments of a normal, recurring
nature, have been included. 

 On a modified cash basis,
revenue is earned when cash is received and expenses are incurred when
cash is paid. GAAP basis financial statements disclose revenue as
earned and expenses as incurred, without regard to receipts or
payments. The modified cash basis of accounting is utilized to permit
the accrual for distributions to be paid to unit owners (those
distributions approved by the Trustees for the Trust).
The Trust's distributable income represents royalty income received by
the Trust during the period plus interest income less any expenses
incurred by the Trust, all on a cash basis. In the opinion of the
Trustees, the use of the modified cash basis of accounting provides a
more meaningful presentation to unit owners of the results of
operations of the Trust. 

 The Trust receives adjustments
from the operating companies based on their final calculations of
royalties payable during the prior periods, including the immediately
preceding calendar quarter. Negative adjustments are carried over to
the succeeding quarter. A negative adjustment of Euros 444,931 538,651) from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 was carried over
and offset against royalty revenue received in the first quarter
of fiscal 2021. 

 Producing gas and oil
royalty rights - 

 	The rights to certain gas
and oil royalties in Germany were transferred to the Trust at their
net book value by North European Oil Company (the "Company") (see
Note 2). The net book value of the royalty rights has been reduced to
one dollar 1) in view of the fact that the remaining net book value
of royalty rights is de minimis relative to annual royalties received
and distributed by the Trust and does not bear any meaningful
relationship to the fair value of such rights or the actual amount of
proved producing reserves. 

 Federal and state
income taxes - 

 The Trust, as a grantor trust
and also under a private letter ruling issued by the Internal Revenue
Service, is exempt from federal income taxes. The Trust has no
state income tax obligations. 

 F-7 

 Cash and cash equivalents -

Cash and cash equivalents
are defined as amounts deposited in bank accounts and amounts invested
in certificates of deposit and U. S. Treasury bills with original
maturities generally of three months or less from the date of
purchase. The investment options available to the Trust are limited
in accordance with specific provisions of the Trust Agreement. As of
October 31, 2021, the uninsured amounts held in the Trust's U.S. bank
accounts were 1,147,939. In addition, the Trust held Euros 9,942,
the equivalent of 11,498, in its German bank account at October 31,
2021. 

 Net income per unit - 

 	Net income per unit is based
upon the number of units outstanding at the end of the period. As of
October 31, 2021 and 2020, there were 9,190,590 units of beneficial
interest outstanding. 

 New accounting
pronouncements - 

 The Trust is not aware of
any recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting standards that
would be expected to have a significant impact on the Trust's
financial position or results of operations. 

(2) Formation of the Trust: 

 The Trust was formed on
September 10, 1975. As of September 30, 1975, the Company was
liquidated and the remaining assets and liabilities of the Company,
including its royalty rights, were transferred to the Trust. The
Trust, on behalf of the owners of beneficial interest in the Trust,
holds overriding royalty rights covering gas and oil production in
certain concessions or leases in the Federal Republic of Germany.
These rights are held under contracts with local German exploration
and development subsidiaries of ExxonMobil Corp. and the Royal
Dutch/Shell Group of Companies. Under these contracts, the Trust
receives various percentage royalties on the proceeds of the sales of
certain products from the areas involved. At the present time,
royalties are received for sales of gas well gas, oil well gas,
crude oil, condensate and sulfur. 

 (3) Related party transactions: 

 John R. Van Kirk, the
Managing Director of the Trust, provides office services to the
Trust at cost. For such office services, the Trust reimbursed the
Managing Director 5,613 and 4,020 in fiscal 2021 and 2020,
respectively. 

 Lawrence A. Kobrin, a
Trustee of the Trust, is no longer a partner of the firm but
remained a Senior Counsel at Cahill Gordon & Reindel LLP, which
serves as counsel to the Trust. For legal services, the
Trust paid Cahill Gordon & Reindel LLP 33,405 and 46,997 in
fiscal 2021 and 2020, respectively. 

(4) Employee benefit plan: 

 The Trust has established a
savings incentive match plan for employees (SIMPLE IRA) that is
available to both employees of the Trust, one of whom is the Managing
Director. The Trustees authorized the making of contributions by the
Trust to the accounts of employees, on a matching basis,
of up to 3 of cash compensation paid to each such employee for
the 2021 and 2020 calendar years.

Item 9A. Controls
and Procedures. 

 Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

 The Trust maintains disclosure
controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information
required to be disclosed by the Trust is recorded, processed,
summarized, accumulated and communicated to its management, which
consists of the Managing Director, to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure, and reported within the time periods specified in
the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and forms. The Managing
Director has performed an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design
and operation of the Trust's disclosure controls and procedures as of
October 31, 2021. Based on that evaluation, the Managing Director
concluded that the Trust's disclosure controls and procedures were
effective as of October 31, 2021. 

 Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

 Part A. Management's
Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

 The Trust's management is
responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control
over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule
13a-15(f)) for the Trust. There are inherent limitations in the
effectiveness of any internal control, including the possibility of
human error and the circumvention or overriding of controls.
Accordingly, even effective internal controls can provide only
reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation.
Further, because of changes in conditions, the effectiveness of
internal control may vary over time. Management has evaluated the
Trust's internal control over financial reporting as of October 31,
2021. This assessment was based on criteria for effective
internal control over financial reporting described in the standards
promulgated by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board and in
the Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) issued by
the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
(COSO). Based on this evaluation, management concluded that the
Trust's internal control over financial reporting was effective as
of October 31, 2021. 

Part B. Attestation

 Not applicable 

 Part C. Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

 There have been no changes in
the Trust's internal control over financial reporting that occurred
during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 that have materially affected,
or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Trust's internal
control over financial reporting.

 Ref: North European Oil Royalty Trust 
Calculation of the Cost Depletion Percentage 
For the Calendar Year 2021 

 Trustees: 

 In accordance with the request of the Trustees of
North European Oil Royalty Trust (the "Trust"), Graves
& Co. Consulting LLC of Houston, Texas has performed the
calculations necessary to derive the cost depletion percentage for
the 2021 calendar year. The cost depletion percentage was prepared
for use by unit owners of the Trust in filing federal income tax
returns. In order to calculate the cost depletion percentage, we
prepared a report of the estimated remaining proved producing
reserves attributable to the overriding royalty interests of the Trust
in the Northwest German Basin of the Federal Republic of Germany with
an effective date of October 1, 2021. 

 We have reviewed all available information with
respect to 100 of the Trust's proved developed properties used in
the calculation of the cost depletion percentage as discussed later
in this report. It is our opinion that these properties represent
all of the Trust's assets that may be classified as proved for this
purpose as per the Securities and Exchange Commission directives
detailed later in this report. 

 The reserves associated with this review have been
classified in accordance with the definitions of the Securities and
Exchange Commission as found in Part 210-Form and Content of and
Requirements for Financial Statements, Securities Act of 1933,
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Public Utility Holding Company Act
of 1935, Investment Company Act of 1940, Investment Advisers Act of
1940, and Energy Policy and Conservation Act of 1975, under Rules of
General Application Section 210.4-10 financial accounting and
reporting for oil and gas producing activities pursuant to the
Federal securities laws and the Energy Policy and Conservation Act
of 1975. 

 The proved producing reserves are as of October 1,
2021 and the reported sales are for the twelve-month period ending
September 30, 2021. The use of the period ending September 30, 2021
is consistent with prior years and allows the timely calculation of
the royalty reserves and the cost depletion percentage for the
calendar year. Throughout this report the unit price used for crude
oil, condensate, natural gas and sulfur is based upon the prices in
effect at the time of the royalty calculations. The price for each
of the products is then averaged for the twelve-month period to arrive
at the unit price. 

 Based on the results of our calculation of estimated
remaining proved producing reserves contained in the first part of this
report, we have performed the calculations necessary to derive the cost
depletion percentage for the 2021 calendar year. As detailed in
Attachment B, the cost depletion percentage for the 2021 calendar
year for Trust unit owners is equal to 17.7008 of the unit owner's
cost basis as of January 1, 2021. 

 Discussion 

 The scope of this study was to review limited
information we were able to compile and to prepare an estimate of the
proved producing reserves subject to the Trust's royalty interests from
which the cost depletion percentage could be calculated. We prepared
reserve estimates using acceptable evaluation principles for each source.
These estimates were based in large part on the limited information
supplied by the operator of the relevant properties. 

 The quantities presented herein are estimated reserves
of oil, natural gas, natural gas liquids and sulfur that geologic and
engineering data demonstrate can be recovered from known reservoirs under
current economic conditions with reasonable certainty. 

 Description of Holdings 

 The Trust holds various overriding royalty rights on
sales of gas, sulfur and oil from certain concessions and leases in
the Federal Republic of Germany. The Oldenburg concession (1,386,000
acres), located in the federal state of Lower Saxony, is held by
Oldenburgische Erdolgesellschaft ("OEG"). OEG in turn is owned by
Mobil Erdgas-Erdol GmbH ("Mobil Erdgas"), the German subsidiary of
ExxonMobil Corp. and by BEB Erdgas und Erdol GmbH ("BEB"), a joint
venture of ExxonMobil Corp. and the Royal Dutch/Shell Group of
Companies. As a result by direct and indirect ownership, ExxonMobil
Corp. owns two-thirds of OEG and the Royal Dutch/Shell Group owns
one-third of OEG. 

 In 2002 Mobil Erdgas and BEB formed a new company
ExxonMobil Production Deutschland GmbH to carry out all exploration,
drilling and production within the Oldenburg concession. All sales
activities are still handled by either Mobil Erdgas or BEB. 

 The Oldenburg concession is currently the primary
source of royalty income for the Trust. All proved producing
reserves within the Oldenburg concession are covered by this report.
Although the Trust has royalty interests in other areas, these areas
are no longer used in the calculation of the annual cost depletion
percentage because there is minimal current production from these
areas. 

 The Trust's rights in the Oldenburg concession are
described as follows: 

 Under one set of rights covering the western part
of the Oldenburg concession (approximately 662,000 acres), the Trust
receives a royalty payment of 4 on gross receipts from sales by
Mobil Erdgas of gas well gas, oil well gas, crude oil and condensate
("Mobil Agreement"). Under the Mobil Agreement there is no deduction
of costs prior to the calculation of royalties from gas well gas or
oil well gas, which together account for approximately 99 of all
the royalties under said agreement. 

Under another series of rights covering the entire Oldenburg
concession and pursuant to an agreement with OEG, the Trust receives
royalties at the rate of 0.6667 on gross receipts from sales of gas
well gas, oil well gas, crude oil, condensate and sulfur (removed
during the processing of sour gas) less a certain allowed deduction
of costs ("OEG Agreement"). 

Under the OEG Agreement, 50 of the field handling and treatment costs
as reported for state royalty purposes are deducted from gross sales
receipts prior to the calculation of the royalty to be paid to the
Trust. Sulfur is a by-product of gas production and is not considered
in the computation of total cost depletion. 

The Trust is also entitled to receive from Mobil Erdgas, a 2 
royalty payment on gross receipts from sales of sulfur obtained as a
by-product of sour gas produced from the western part of Oldenburg.
However, the payment of the sulfur royalty is provisional on whether
Mobil Erdgas' selling price meets or exceeds the indexed base price.
Sulfur is a by-product of gas production and is not considered in the
computation of total cost depletion. 

 Oldenburg
Area - Sales and Reserves 

 The Trust's royalty income currently comes
exclusively from the Oldenburg area. Gas production accounts for
the majority of the income; however, the hydrogen sulfide in much of
the gas produced necessitates its removal before the gas can be sold.
At the Grossenkneten desulfurization plant, the hydrogen sulfide in
sour gas is removed. The plant's present input capacity stands at
approximately 400 million cubic feet ("MMcf") per day following
EMPG's retirement of Unit 3 in April, 2017. The elimination of Unit
3 effectively reduced the input capacity by one third. 

 Total Sales 

 During the twelve months ending September 30, 2021,
total sales for the Oldenburg area were as follows:

Net Reserves 

 To present an accurate picture of estimated proved
producing reserves net to the Trust, the gross reserve figures
outlined above must be modified by the impact of the different
royalty rates in effect in the Oldenburg concession. A comparison of
the Trust's overriding royalty rates in both the western and eastern
areas of Oldenburg is as follows: 

Royalty Source 
 West 
 East 

 Mobil Erdgas Gas & Oil

 Mobil Erdgas Sulfur

(1) Prior to the
calculation of royalties, 50 of costs as reported for 
state royalty purposes are deducted. 

The application of these royalty rates to the estimated
gross remaining proved producing reserves attributable to the western
and eastern Oldenburg areas yields the combined estimated proved
producing reserves net to the Trust. The Trust's estimated remaining
net proved producing reserves as of October 1, 2021 and net sales for
the twelve month period ending September 30, 2021 are as follows:

 Limitations of Available
Data 

 The reserves considered in this report are defined as
proved producing reserves. Proved producing reserves are limited to
those quantities which can be expected to be recoverable commercially
from known reservoirs at current prices and costs, under existing
regulatory practices and with existing conventional equipment and
operating methods. Proved producing reserves do not include either
proved developed non producing reserves or any class of probable
reserves. 

 The estimate of reserves included in this report is
based primarily upon production history or analogy with wells in the
area producing from the same or similar formations. In addition to
individual well production history, geological and well test
information, when available, were utilized in the evaluation. 

 The reserves included in this report are estimates
only and should not be construed as being exact quantities. The
accuracy of the estimates is dependent upon the quality of available
data and upon the independent geological and engineering interpretation
of that data. The quantities presented herein are estimated reserves
of hydrocarbons and produced products that geologic and engineering
data demonstrate can be recovered from known reservoirs under current
economic conditions with reasonable certainty. Reserve estimates
presented in this report are calculated using acceptable methods and
procedures and are believed to be appropriate and reasonable; however,
future reservoir performance may justify revision of these
estimates. 

 For the purpose of this report, estimated reserves are
scheduled for recovery primarily on the basis of actual producing rates
or appropriate well test information. They were prepared giving
consideration to engineering and geological data, anticipated producing
mechanisms, the number and types of completions, as well as past
performance of analogous reservoirs. Individual well production
histories, when available, were analyzed and an appropriate daily
producing rate was utilized for each individual well in the
preparation of a forecast of future producing rates until an
anticipated economic limit. 

 No information was received from the operator
concerning activity in the field during the Trust's Fiscal 2021 other
than there was no drilling activity. 

 The estimates of reserves and the forecasted rates of
production may be subject to regulation by various agencies, changes in
market demand or other factors. Consequently, the volumes of reserves
recovered, and the actual rates of recovery, may vary from the estimates
included herein. 

 The Trust, as an overriding royalty interest owner,
does not receive proprietary data from the various operators on
producing wells. Data, such as logs, core analysis, reservoir tests,
pressure tests, gas analyses, geologic maps, and individual well
production histories on all of the wells which are used in volumetric
and material balance type reserve estimates, are not available to the
Trust. The lack of such data increases the inherent uncertainties of
our reserve estimate. 

 The Trust receives quarterly statements from the
operators that report production, sales and revenue data. Utilizing the
same procedures as in prior years, this information has
been used to prepare this annual report. In addition, the Trust retains
a part-time consultant in Germany who is familiar with the German
petroleum industry in general and the operating companies in particular.
His periodic reports and communications were considered in the
preparation of this report. 

 We believe that reserve estimates prepared using all
the available data are appropriate and sufficient for the calculation
of the cost depletion percentage. However, due to the limitations of
available data, this estimate of reserves cannot have the same degree
of accuracy that an estimate of reserves prepared using all pertinent
data would have. Our experience in the evaluation of reserves using
such limited data compensates somewhat for the limitations of available
data. 

 The data in the reports received by the Trust is in
metric tons and cubic meters. The following Metric to English Unit
conversion factors were used: 

Gas: 
 37.25 cubic feet per cubic meter at 14.7 psia and 60 degrees
Fahrenheit 

 Oil: 
 7.23 barrels per metric ton 

 Sulfur: 
 1.1 short tons per metric ton 

Calculation of Cost Depletion
Percentage 

 The categories of proved producing reserves considered
in the calculation of the cost depletion percentage are oil, oil well
gas, and gas well gas. Sulfur is a by-product of gas production and is
not considered in the computation of total cost depletion percentage. 

 For each category of reserves, a product base was
established for the Trust as of January 1, 1976. Through the use of
these product bases, we can account for the relative size of each of
these categories of reserves and the corresponding impact on the
calculation of the cost depletion percentage. The product base for each
category of proved producing reserves is reduced annually by an
adjustment that is calculated by multiplying the product base at the
beginning of the current year by the depletion factor for that category
of reserves. 

 The depletion factor for each category of reserves is
the ratio of the relevant net sales during the current year to the
corresponding adjusted net proved producing reserves at the beginning
of the current year. 

 Significant items in the cost depletion percentage
calculation that appear on Attachment B as specific item numbers, shown
in parentheses and their sources are as follows: 

The adjusted estimated net proved producing
reserves as of 10/1/2020 Line (3) is obtained by adding the estimated
remaining net proved producing reserves as of 10/1/2020 Line (1) and
the adjustments to reserves during the period Line (2). Therefore
Line (3) = Line (1) + Line (2). 

 The depletion factor Line (6) for each
category of proved producing reserves is obtained by dividing the
relevant net sales Line (4) by the corresponding adjusted estimated net
proved producing reserves as of 10/1/2020 Line (3). Therefore Line (6)
= Line (4) / Line (3). 

 The product base for each category of proved
producing reserves as of 1/1/2020 Line (7) and the adjustment taken
during 2020 Line (8) were obtained from the previous year's report.
The product base as of 1/1/2021 Line (9) forms the initial starting
point for the calculation of the cost depletion percentage for the
2021 tax year. The product base for 1/1/2021 Line (9) then is Line (7)
- Line (8). 

 The adjustment to the product base for each
category of proved producing reserves Line (10) is used to reduce the
product base as of the beginning of each year. This adjustment is the
product of the depletion factor for each category of proved producing
reserves Line (6) multiplied by the corresponding product base as of
1/1/2021 Line (9). Therefore Line (10) = Line (6) x Line (9). 

 The cost depletion percentage Line (11) then
is the sum of the adjustment to the product base of each category of
proved producing reserves [Sum Line (10)] divided by the sum of the
product base for each category as of 1/1/2021 [Sum Line (9)]. Therefore
Line (11) = [Sum Line (10)] / [Sum Line (9)]. 

The cost depletion percentage represents the total
allowable cost depletion for the 2021 calendar year for the Trust's unit
owners, expressed as a percentage of their cost base as of January 1,
2021.

directors, officers, employees or contractors have any interest in
the subject properties and neither the engagement to make this study
and calculation nor our compensation is contingent on our estimate of
reserves or the results of our calculation.

OF 1935, INVESTMENT COMPANY ACT OF 1940, INVESTMENT ADVISERS ACT OF

 Rules of General Application 

 Section 210.4-10 Financial accounting and
reporting for oil and gas producing activities pursuant to the
Federal securities laws and the Energy Policy and Conservation Act
of 1975. 

 Reserves 

 Reserves are estimated remaining quantities of oil and
gas and related substances anticipated to be economically producible,
as of a given date, by application of development projects to known
accumulations. In addition, there must exist, or there must be a
reasonable expectation that there will exist, the legal right to produce
or a revenue interest in the production, installed means of delivering
oil and gas or related substances to market, and all permits and
financing required to implement the project. 

 Reserves should not be assigned to adjacent reservoirs
isolated by major, potentially sealing, faults until those reservoirs
are penetrated and evaluated as economically producible. Reserves should
not be assigned to areas that are clearly separated from a known
accumulation by a non-productive reservoir i.e., absence of
reservoir, structurally low reservoir, or negative test results).
Such areas may contain prospective resources i.e., potentially
recoverable resources from undiscovered accumulations). 

 Proved Oil and Gas Reserves 

 Proved oil and gas reserves are those quantities of oil
and gas, which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be
estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible--from
a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic
conditions, operating methods, and government regulations--prior to the
time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless
evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain, regardless of
whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for the
estimation. The project to extract the hydrocarbons must have commenced
or the operator must be reasonably certain that it will commence the
project within a reasonable time. 

 The area of the reservoir considered as proved
includes: 
 The area identified by drilling and limited by fluid
contacts, if any, and 

 Adjacent undrilled portions of the reservoir that can, with
reasonable certainty, be judged to be continuous with it and to contain
economically producible oil or gas on the basis of available
geoscience and engineering data. 

 In the absence of data on fluid contacts, proved quantities in a
reservoir are limited by the lowest known hydrocarbons (LKH) as seen in
a well penetration unless geoscience, engineering, or performance data
and reliable technology establishes a lower contact with reasonable
certainty. 

 Where direct observation from well penetrations has defined a
highest known oil (HKO) elevation and the potential exists for an
associated gas cap, proved oil reserves may be assigned in the
structurally higher portions of the reservoir only if geoscience,
engineering, or performance data and reliable technology establish the
higher contact with reasonable certainty. 

 Reserves which can be produced economically through application of
improved recovery techniques (including, but not limited to, fluid
injection) are included in the proved classification when: 

 Successful testing by a pilot project in an area of
the reservoir with properties no more favorable than in the reservoir
as a whole, the operation of an installed program in the reservoir or
an analogous reservoir, or other evidence using reliable technology
establishes the reasonable certainty of the engineering analysis on
which the project or program was based; and 

 The project has been approved for development by all necessary
parties and entities, including governmental entities. 

 Existing economic conditions include prices and costs at which
economic producibility from a reservoir is to be determined. The price
shall be the average price during the 12-month period prior to the
ending date of the period covered by the report, determined as an
unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for
each month within such period, unless prices are defined by contractual
arrangements, excluding escalations based upon future conditions. 

Reasonable certainty. If deterministic
methods are used, reasonable certainty means a high degree of
confidence that the quantities will be recovered. If probabilistic
methods are used, there should be at least a 90 probability that the
quantities actually recovered will equal or exceed the estimate. A
high degree of confidence exists if the quantity is much more likely
to be achieved than not, and, as changes due to increased availability
of geoscience (geological, geophysical, and geochemical), engineering,
and economic data are made to estimated ultimate recovery (EUR) with
time, reasonably certain EUR is much more likely to increase or remain
constant than to decrease. 

 Reliable technology. Reliable technology
is a grouping of one or more technologies (including computational
methods) that has been field tested and has been demonstrated to
provide reasonably certain results with consistency and repeatability
in the formation being evaluated or in an analogous formation. 

 Probable Reserves 

 Probable reserves are those additional reserves that
are less certain to be recovered than proved reserves but which,
together with proved reserves, are as likely as not to be recovered. 

 When deterministic methods are used, it is as likely
as not that actual remaining quantities recovered will exceed the sum
of estimated proved plus probable reserves. When probabilistic methods
are used, there should be at least a 50 probability that the actual
quantities recovered will equal or exceed the proved plus probable
reserves estimates. 

 Probable reserves may be assigned to areas of a reservoir adjacent
to proved reserves where data control or interpretations of available
data are less certain, even if the interpreted reservoir continuity of
structure or productivity does not meet the reasonable certainty
criterion. Probable reserves may be assigned to areas that are
structurally higher than the proved area if these areas are in
communication with the proved reservoir. 

 Probable reserves estimates also include potential incremental
quantities associated with a greater percentage recovery of the
hydrocarbons in place than assumed for proved reserves. 

 Possible Reserves 

 Possible reserves are those additional reserves that
are less certain to be recovered than probable reserves. 

 When deterministic methods are used, the total
quantities ultimately recovered from a project have a low probability
of exceeding proved plus probable plus possible reserves. When
probabilistic methods are used, there should be at least a 10 
probability that the total quantities ultimately recovered will equal
or exceed the proved plus probable plus possible reserves estimates.

Possible reserves may be assigned to areas of a reservoir adjacent
to probable reserves where data control and interpretations of
available data are progressively less certain. Frequently, this will
be in areas where geoscience and engineering data are unable to define
clearly the area and vertical limits of commercial production from the
reservoir by a defined project. 

 Possible reserves also include incremental quantities associated
with a greater percentage recovery of the hydrocarbons in place than
the recovery quantities assumed for probable reserves. 

 The proved plus probable and proved plus probable plus possible
reserves estimates must be based on reasonable alternative technical
and commercial interpretations within the reservoir or subject project
that are clearly documented, including comparisons to results in
successful similar projects. 

 Possible reserves may be assigned where geoscience and engineering
data identify directly adjacent portions of a reservoir within the same
accumulation that may be separated from proved areas by faults with
displacement less than formation thickness or other geological
discontinuities and that have not been penetrated by a wellbore, and
the registrant believes that such adjacent portions are in
communication with the known (proved) reservoir. Possible reserves may
be assigned to areas that are structurally higher or lower than the
proved area if these areas are in communication with the proved
reservoir. 

 Pursuant to paragraph (a)(22)(iii) of this section, where direct
observation has defined a highest known oil (HKO) elevation and the
potential exists for an associated gas cap, proved oil reserves should
be assigned in the structurally higher portions of the reservoir above
the HKO only if the higher contact can be established with reasonable
certainty through reliable technology. Portions of the reservoir that
do not meet this reasonable certainty criterion may be assigned as
probable and possible oil or gas based on reservoir fluid properties
and pressure gradient interpretations. 

 Developed Oil and Gas Reserves 

 Developed oil and gas reserves are reserves of any
category that can be expected to be recovered: 

 Through existing wells with existing equipment and
 operating methods or in which the cost of the required equipment is
relatively minor compared to the cost of a new well; and 

 Through installed extraction equipment and infrastructure
operational at the time of the reserves estimate if the extraction is
by means not involving a well. 

 Undeveloped Oil and Gas Reserves 

 Undeveloped oil and gas reserves are reserves of any
category that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled
acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is
required for recompletion. 

 Reserves on undrilled acreage shall be limited to
those directly offsetting development spacing areas that are reasonably
certain of production when drilled, unless evidence using reliable
technology exists that establishes reasonable certainty of economic
producibility at greater distances. 

 Undrilled locations can be classified as having undeveloped
reserves only if a development plan has been adopted indicating that
they are scheduled to be drilled within five years, unless the specific
circumstances, justify a longer time. 

 Under no circumstances shall estimates for undeveloped reserves be
attributable to any acreage for which an application of fluid injection
or other improved recovery technique is contemplated, unless such
techniques have been proved effective by actual projects in the same
reservoir or an analogous reservoir, as defined in paragraph (a)(2) of
this section, or by other evidence using reliable technology
establishing reasonable certainty. 

 Additional Definitions: 

 Deterministic Estimate 

 The method of estimating reserves or resources is called
deterministic when a single value for each parameter (from the
geoscience, engineering, or economic data) in the reserves calculation
is used in the reserves estimation procedure. 

 Probabilistic Estimate 

 The method of estimation of reserves or resources is
called probabilistic when the full range of values that could
reasonably occur for each unknown parameter (from the geoscience and
engineering data) is used to generate a full range of possible outcomes
and their associated probabilities of occurrence. 

 Reasonable Certainty 

 If deterministic methods are used, reasonable certainty
means a high degree of confidence that the quantities will be
recovered. If probabilistic methods are used, there should be at least
a 90 probability that the quantities actually recovered will equal or
exceed the estimate. A high degree of confidence exists if the quantity
is much more likely to be achieved than not, and, as changes due to
increased availability of geoscience (geological, geophysical, and
geochemical), engineering, and economic data are made to estimated
ultimate recovery (EUR) with time, reasonably certain EUR is much more
likely to increase or remain constant than to decrease.
