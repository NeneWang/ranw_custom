PART I 

Item 1. Business 

Corporate Overview 

We are currently a shell
company with no meaningful assets or operations other than our efforts to identify and merge with an operating company. We were
incorporated in the State of Nevada on June 13, 2012. Our current business office is located at No. A1111, Huafeng Financial Port, 1003,
Xin an Sixth Road, Bao an District, Shenzhen, Guangdong Province, P.R.C. Our telephone number is +86-13926561348. 

We were initially an exploration
stage company under the name of Freedom Petroleum Inc. (changed to Steampunk Wizards, Inc., effective on July 2, 2015) that originally
intended to engage in the exploration and development of oil and gas properties. In April 2015, after reviewing the markets with investor
appetite and management's duties to its shareholders, the Company determined to discontinue its oil and gas operation. We then began exploring
opportunities in the computer gaming and application industry. 

We engaged in computer game
development until October 13, 2016, when control of our company changed pursuant to a share purchase agreement and a spin-off agreement.
On October 26, 2016, our corporate name was changed from Steampunk Wizards, Inc. to Tianci International, Inc. 
The name change was effected on November 27, 2016, in connection with the merger of us into our then subsidiary, Tianci International
Inc. 

Effective April 6, 2017, we
effectuated a 1-for-40 reverse stock split (the 2017 Reverse Stock Split of our issued and outstanding shares of common
stock, 0.0001 par value, whereby 49,854,280 outstanding shares were exchanged for 1,246,357 shares of our common stock. Common share
amounts and per share amounts in these accompanying financial statements and notes have been retroactively adjusted to reflect this reverse
stock split. 

On August 3, 2017, we entered
into a Stock Purchase Agreement (the SPA with Shifang Wan (the Seller ), the record holder of 4,397,837 common
shares, or approximately 87.00 of the issued and outstanding of Common Stock of the Company, and Chuah Su Chen and Chuah Su Mei (collectively,
the Purchasers , and together with the Company and the Seller, the Parties ). Pursuant to the SPA, the Seller
sold to the Purchasers and the Purchasers acquired from the Sellers the Shares for a total gross purchase price of Three Hundred Fifty
Thousand Dollars 350,000). The acquisition was consummated on August 15, 2017. The Purchasers used personal funds to acquire the Shares. 

Effective August 6, 2021,
Tianci International, Inc., a Nevada corporation we, us, or the Company ), Chuah Su Mei, our
former Chief Executive Officer, President and Director, and Silver Glory Group Limited, entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (the Stock
Purchase Agreement pursuant to which Chuah Su Mei agreed to sell to Silver Glory Group Limited all 1,793,000 shares of common
stock of the Company held by her (the Shares for cash consideration of Five Hundred Twenty Five Thousand Dollars 525,000)
(the Transaction ). The Shares represent approximately 73.18 of the issued and outstanding common stock of the Company and
are being sold in reliance upon an exemption from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, pursuant to Section 4(2)
thereof. The sale of the Shares consummated on August 26, 2021, and was purchased by Silver Glory Group Limited using its working capital.
As a result of the Transaction, Silver Glory Group Limited holds a controlling interest in the Company and may unilaterally determine
the election of the members of the Board of Directors (the Board and other substantive matters requiring approval of the
Company s stockholders. 

Upon the closing of the Transaction,
on August 26, 2021, the then current directors and officers of the Company resigned from his or her positions with the Company. The resignations
were not due to any dispute or disagreement with the Company on any matter relating to the Company's operations, policies or practices. 

Concurrently with such resignation,
the following individuals were appointed to serve in the offices set forth next to his name until the next annual meeting of stockholders
of the Company and until such director s successor is elected and qualified or until such director s earlier death, resignation
or removal.

1 

None of the directors or
executive officers has a direct family relationship with any of the Company s directors or executive officers. Each officer and
director will serve in his positions without compensation. The Company plans to enter into compensatory arrangements with its officers
and directors in the future. 

Current Business 

Our principal business is
to achieve long-term growth potential through a combination with a business rather than immediate, short-term earnings. Based on proposed
business activities, we are a blank check company. We intend to comply with the periodic reporting requirements of the Exchange
Act for so long as it is subject to those requirements. 

As of the date of this Annual
Report, we have not entered into any binding agreement with any party regarding acquisition opportunities for us. We hope to continue
to engage in discussions with other operating businesses affiliated with our executive officers regarding potential acquisition opportunities.
There is no assurance that any nonbinding term sheet will result into a definitive purchase transaction nor can we assure you that we
will be able to successfully acquire such company or any company in the near future. 

The analysis of new business
opportunities will be undertaken by or under the supervision of the Company s officers. We have unrestricted flexibility in seeking,
analyzing and participating in potential business opportunities. In its efforts to analyze potential acquisition targets, we will consider
the following kinds of factors: 

Potential for growth, indicated by new technology, anticipated market expansion or new products; 

Competitive position as compared to other firms of similar size and experience within the industry segment as well as within the industry as a whole; 

Strength and diversity of management, either in place or scheduled for recruitment; 

Capital requirements and anticipated availability of required funds from the Registrant, from operations, through the sale of additional securities, through joint ventures or similar arrangements or from other sources; 

The extent to which the business opportunity can be advanced; 

The accessibility of required management expertise, personnel, raw materials, services, professional assistance and other required items; and 

Other relevant factors. 

In applying the foregoing
criteria, no one of which will be controlling, management will attempt to analyze all factors and circumstances and make a determination
based upon reasonable investigative measures and available data. Potentially available acquisition opportunities may occur in many different
industries, and at various stages of development, all of which will make the task of comparative investigation and analysis of such business
opportunities extremely difficult and complex. We may not discover or adequately evaluate adverse facts about the business to be acquired.
In evaluating a prospective business combination, we will conduct as extensive a due diligence review of potential targets as possible
given the lack of information that may be available regarding private companies, our limited personnel and financial resources. 

We expect that our due diligence
will encompass, among other things, meetings with the target business s incumbent management and inspection of its facilities, as
necessary, as well as a review of financial and other information, which is made available to us. This due diligence review will be conducted
either by our management or by unaffiliated third parties we may engage. Our lack of funds and the lack of full-time management will likely
make it impracticable to conduct a complete and exhaustive investigation and analysis of a target business before we consummate a business
combination. Management decisions, therefore, will likely be made without detailed feasibility studies, independent analysis, market surveys
and the like which, if we had more funds available to us, would be desirable. We will be particularly dependent in making decisions upon
information provided by the promoters, owners, sponsors or others associated with the target business seeking our participation. 

The time and costs required
to select and evaluate a target business and to structure and complete a business combination cannot presently be ascertained with any
degree of certainty. Any costs incurred with respect to the indemnification and evaluation of a prospective business combination that
is not ultimately completed will result in a loss to us. 

2 

Additionally, we are in a
highly competitive market for a small number of business opportunities, which could reduce the likelihood of consummating a successful
business combination. We are, and will continue to be, an insignificant participant in the business of seeking mergers with, joint ventures
with and acquisitions of small private and public entities. A large number of established and well-financed entities, including small
public companies and venture capital firms, are active in mergers and acquisitions of companies that may be desirable target candidates
for us. Nearly all these entities have significantly greater financial resources, technical expertise and managerial capabilities than
we do; consequently, we will be at a competitive disadvantage in identifying possible business opportunities and successfully completing
a business combination. These competitive factors may reduce the likelihood of our identifying and consummating a successful business
combination. 

Historical Activities 

2014 Securities Sale 

In January 2014, we were a
party to a securities purchase agreement (the 2014 SPA by and among ourselves, certain of our shareholders (the Selling
Shareholders owning an aggregate of 27,000,000 shares (before the 2017 Reverse Stock Split) (approximately 51.7 of our common

following the close of the Private Sale. Following the Private Sale, a change in control occurred since Lin gained control of almost 52 
of our outstanding common stock.

pursuant to the registration of us in the register of members maintained by Malta Co. as the new holder of the Steampunk Stock and the

owned subsidiary (the Subsidiary of us and there was a change of control of us following the closing. The Shareholders
of Malta Co. owned approximately 55 of our issued and outstanding common stock. There were no warrants, options or other equity instruments
issued in connection with the Exchange Agreement.

in 2014 to acquire the intellectual property (IP) related to an unfinished game called Tangled Tut. Making full use of the
team s experience and diverse talent set, the company built the first mobile game with 3D printable rewards embedded and the associated
IP and server technology. 

Through Malta Co, we became
an independent games development and technology company that specialized in developing enchanting games and gaming technology where the
real and virtual worlds blur. We launched a mobile casual game called Bungee Mummy Challenges, designed primarily for smartphones
and tablets (supporting both Android and IOS), in late August of 2015.

discussion contains forward-looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties, such as our plans,
objectives, expectations and intentions. Actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those anticipated in these

Our audited financial statements

Overview 

We are currently a shell
company with no meaningful assets or operations other than our efforts to identify and merge with an operating company. We were
incorporated in the State of Nevada on June 13, 2012. Our current business office is located at No. A1111, Huafeng Financial Port, 1003,
Xin an Sixth Road, Bao an District, Shenzhen, Guangdong Province, P.R.C. Our telephone number is +86-13926561348. 

We were initially an exploration
stage company under the name of Freedom Petroleum Inc. (changed to Steampunk Wizards, Inc., effective on July 2, 2015) that originally
intended to engage in the exploration and development of oil and gas properties. In April 2015, after reviewing the markets with investor
appetite and management's duties to its shareholders, the Company determined to discontinue its oil and gas operation. We then began exploring
opportunities in the computer gaming and application industry. 

We engaged in computer game
development until October 13, 2016, when control of our company changed pursuant to a share purchase agreement and a spin-off agreement.
On October 26, 2016, our corporate name was changed from Steampunk Wizards, Inc. to Tianci International, Inc. 
The name change was effected on November 27, 2016, pursuant to Nevada Revised Statutes Section 92A.180 in connection with the merger of
us into our then subsidiary, Tianci International Inc. 

On August 3, 2017, we entered
into a Stock Purchase Agreement (the SPA with Shifang Wan (the Seller ), the record holder of 4,397,837 common
shares, or approximately 87.00 of the issued and outstanding of Common Stock of the Company, and Chuah Su Chen and Chuah Su Mei (collectively,
the Purchasers , and together with the Company and the Seller, the Parties ). Pursuant to the SPA, the Seller
sold to the Purchasers and the Purchasers acquired from the Sellers the Shares for a total gross purchase price of Three Hundred Fifty
Thousand Dollars 350,000). The acquisition was consummated on August 15, 2017. The Purchasers used personal funds to acquire the Shares. 

Upon the consummation of the
sale, Ms. Cuilian Cai resigned from her positions as director, Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of the Company. Her
resignation was not due to any dispute or disagreement with the Company on any matter relating to the Company's operations, policies or
practices. Chuah Su Chen and Chuah Su Mei were appointed to serve in the positions set forth next to their names below: 

Name 
 Position 
 
 Chuah Su Chen

Chuah Su Chen and Chuah Su Mei are sisters.

We are in active discussions
with an operating business affiliated with our executive officers regarding potential acquisition. There is no assurance that we will
be able to successfully acquire such company or any company in the near future. 

Effective August 6, 2021,
Tianci International, Inc., a Nevada corporation we, us, or the Company ), Chuah Su Mei, our
Chief Executive Officer, President and Director, and Silver Glory Group Limited, entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (the Stock
Purchase Agreement pursuant to which Chuah Su Mei agreed to sell to Silver Glory Group Limited all 1,793,000 shares of common
stock of the Company held by her (the Shares for cash consideration of Five Hundred Twenty Five Thousand Dollars 525,000)
(the Transaction ). The Shares represent approximately 73.18 of the issued and outstanding common stock of the Company and
are being sold in reliance upon an exemption from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, pursuant to Section 4(2)
thereof. The sale of the Shares consummated on August 26, 2021, and was purchased by Silver Glory Group Limited using its working capital.
As a result of the Transaction, Silver Glory Group Limited holds a controlling interest in the Company and may unilaterally determine
the election of the members of the Board of Directors (the Board and other substantive matters requiring approval of the
Company s stockholders. 

Upon the closing of the Transaction,
on August 26, 2021, each of Chuah Su Chen, Chuah Su Mei, and Jerry Ooi, constituting all current directors and officers of the Company,
resigned from his or her positions with the Company. The resignations were not due to any dispute or disagreement with the Company on
any matter relating to the Company's operations, policies or practices. Each of the foregoing former officers and directors also forgave
all amounts due to them from the Company in connection with the closing of the Transaction. 

Concurrently with such resignation,
the following individuals were appointed to serve in the offices set forth next to his name until the next annual meeting of stockholders
of the Company and until such director s successor is elected and qualified or until such director s earlier death, resignation
or removal.

None of the directors or
executive officers has a direct family relationship with any of the Company s directors or executive officers. Each officer and
director will serve in his positions without compensation. The Company plans to enter into compensatory arrangements with its officers
and directors in the future. 

Limited Operating History; Need for Additional Capital 

We have had limited operations
and have been issued a going concern opinion by our auditor, based upon our reliance on the sale of our common stock and loans
from a related party, as the sole source of funds for our future operations. 

There is no historical financial
information about us upon which to base an evaluation of our performance. We have not generated any revenues from operations. We cannot
guarantee we will be successful in our business operations. Our business is subject to risks inherent in the establishment of a new business
enterprise, including limited capital resources, possible delays in the launching of our games and market or wider economic downturns.
We do not believe we have sufficient funds to operate our business for the next 12 months. 

We have no assurance that
future financing will be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. If financing is not available on satisfactory terms, we may be
unable to continue, develop or expand our operations. Equity financing could result in additional dilution to existing shareholders. If
we are unable to raise additional capital to maintain our operations in the future, we may be unable to carry out our full business plan
or we may be forced to cease operations. 

8 

Going Concern 

Our financial statements have
been prepared on a going concern basis which assumes the Company will be able to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the
normal course of business for the foreseeable future. As of July 31, 2021, the Company had working capital deficiency of 325,110 and
has incurred losses since its inception resulting in an accumulated deficit of 1,452,661. Further losses are anticipated in the development
of the business, raising substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements
do not include any adjustment that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

The ability to continue as
a going concern is dependent upon the Company generating profitable operations in the future and/or to obtain the necessary financing
to meet its obligations and repay its liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due. Management intends to finance
operating costs over the next twelve months with loans from directors and/or private placements of common stock.

Revenue . During the fiscal years
ended July 31, 2021 and 2020, we did not generate any revenues. 

Operating Expenses . Operating expenses
were 63,003 and 73,848 for the years ended July 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Operating expenses mainly consisted of professional
fees and office and miscellaneous expenses. The decrease in operating expenses resulted primarily from the decrease in professional fees
offset by an increase in office and miscellaneous expenses. We expect our operating expenses to increase once we identify and consummate
the acquisition of an operating company. 

Loss from Operations . For
the years ended July 31, 2021, and 2020, we incurred a loss from operations of 63,003 and 73,848, respectively. The decrease in loss
from operations was attributable to the decrease in professional fees. 

Net Loss. For the years ended July 31, 2021, and 2020, we incurred
a net loss of 74,384 and 73,848, respectively. The increase in net loss was primarily attributable to the increase in other expenses
of 11,381, which was an income tax penalty.

Critical Accounting Policies 

The preparation of financial statements in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America U.S. GAAP requires estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities
in the financial statements and accompanying notes. The SEC has defined a company s critical accounting policies as the ones that
are most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations, and which require the company
to make its most difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain.
Based on this definition, we have not identified any additional critical accounting policies and judgments. We also have other key accounting
policies, which involve the use of estimates, judgments and assumptions that are significant to understanding our results, which are described
in Note 3 to our financial statements. Although we believe that our estimates, assumptions and judgments are reasonable, they are based
upon information presently available. Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions, judgments
or conditions.

 Tianci International, Inc. 

Opinion on the Financial Statements 

We have audited the accompanying balance sheets
of Tianci International, Inc. (the Company as of July 31, 2021 and 2020, the related statements of operations, stockholders 
deficit, and cash flows for the years ended July 31, 2021 and 2020, and the related notes (collectively
referred to as the financial statements . In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material
respects, the financial position of the Company at July 31, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for
the years ended July 31, 2021 and 2020, in conformity with the U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 

Going Concern 

The accompanying financial statements have been
prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern. As described in Note 2 to the financial statements, the Company has not
yet established an ongoing source of revenues sufficient to cover its operating costs, which raises substantial doubt about its ability
to continue as a going concern. Management s plans with regard to these matters are described in Note 2. The accompanying
financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

Basis for Opinion 

These financial statements are the responsibility
of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our
audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the
U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We conducted our audits in accordance with the
standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
the financial statements are free of material misstatement , whether due to error or fraud. The
Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of
our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing
an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our audits included performing procedures to assess
the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond
to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating
the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

Critical Audit Matters 

Critical audit matters are matters arising from the current-period
audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to
accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex
judgments. We determined that there are no critical audit matters.

 NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

NOTE 1 - ORGANIZATION AND DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS 

Tianci International, Inc. (the Company ,
 Tianci was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada, as Freedom Petroleum, Inc. on June 13, 2012. In May 2015,
the Company changed its name to Steampunk Wizards, Inc. and on November 9, 2016, the Company changed its name to Tianci International,
Inc. As of the date of this report, the Company is a holding company and has not carried out substantive business operations of its own. 

The Company s fiscal year end is July 31. 

NOTE 2 GOING CONCERN MATTERS 

As of July 31, 2021, the Company had 3,951 in
cash held in trust. The Company had incurred a net loss of 74,384 for the year ended July 31, 2021. 

The Company s cash balance and revenues
generated are not currently sufficient and cannot be projected to cover operating expenses for the next twelve months from the date of
this report. These matters raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. Management s
plans include attempting to improve its business profitability, its ability to generate sufficient cash flows from its operations to meet
its operating needs on a timely basis, obtain additional working capital funds through equity and debt financing arrangements, and restructure
on-going operations to eliminate inefficiencies to raise cash balance in order to meet its anticipated cash requirements for the next
twelve months from the date of this report. However, there can be no assurance that these plans and arrangements will be sufficient to
fund the Company s ongoing capital expenditures, working capital, and other requirements. Management intends to make every effort
to identify and develop sources of funds. The outcome of these matters cannot be predicted at this time. There can be no assurance that
any additional financings will be available to the Company on satisfactory terms and conditions, if at all. 

The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent
upon its ability to raise additional capital and continue profitable operations. The accompanying financial statements do not include
any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

NOTE 3 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

are presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (the U.S. GAAP) and are
presented in U.S. dollars. These annual financial statements include all adjustments that, in the opinion of management, are necessary
in order to make the financial statements not misleading. 

Use of Estimates 

The preparation of financial statements in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements. The estimates and judgments will also affect the reported amounts for certain revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Actual results could differ from these good faith estimates and judgments. 

Cash and Cash Equivalents 

Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand,
cash in trust, and all highly liquid debt instruments with original maturities of three months or less. The Company had 3,951 and 3,968
in cash and cash equivalents as of July 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. 

Fair Value Measurements 

As defined in ASC 820 Fair Value Measurements, 
fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market
participants at the measurement date (exit price). The Company utilizes market data or assumptions that market participants would use
in pricing the asset or liability, including assumptions about risk and the risks inherent in the inputs to the valuation technique. These
inputs can be readily observable, market corroborated, or generally unobservable. The Company classifies fair value balances based on
the observability of those inputs. ASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value.
The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (level 1 measurement)
and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (level 3 measurement). 

The Company's financial instruments consist of
cash, prepaid expense, accounts payable, and due to related parties. The carrying amounts of these financial instruments approximate
fair value due to either length of maturity or interest rates that approximate prevailing rates unless otherwise disclosed in these financial
statements. 

Revenue Recognition 

The Company has yet to generate revenues from
operations. The Company will recognize revenue when control of the promised goods or services are transferred to a customer, in an amount
that reflects the consideration that the Company expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. 

Income Taxes 

Income taxes are accounted for under the asset
and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between
the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax
credit carry forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in
the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities
of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is recorded to
reduce the Company s deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. See Note 6 for information related
to income taxes, including the recorded balances of its valuation allowance related to deferred tax assets. 

F- 7 

Basic and Diluted Earnings (Loss) Per Share 

Basic earnings (loss) per share is calculated
by dividing the Company s net loss applicable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares during the
period. Diluted earnings per share is calculated by dividing the Company s net loss available to common stockholders by the diluted
weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year. The diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding is the basic
weighted number of shares adjusted for any potentially dilutive debt or equity. There are no such common stock equivalents outstanding
as of July 31, 2021 and 2020. 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements 

In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13,
Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326), which requires entities to measure all expected credit losses for financial assets held
at the reporting date based on historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. This replaces the
existing incurred loss model and is applicable to the measurement of credit losses on financial assets measured at amortized cost. This
guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2022. Early application
will be permitted for all entities for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018.
The Company is currently evaluating the impact that the standard will have on its financial statements. 

In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, Reference
Rate Reform (Topic 848) ASU 2020-04 ). ASU 2020-04 contains practical expedients for reference rate reform related activities
that impact debt, leases, derivatives and other contracts. The guidance in ASU 2020-04 is optional and may be elected over time as reference
rate reform activities occur. The Company continues to evaluate the impact of the guidance and may apply the elections as applicable as
changes in the market occur.

NOTE 6 INCOME TAXES 

The Company files income tax returns in the
U.S. federal jurisdiction, and state and local jurisdictions. 

The Company follows ASC 740. Deferred income taxes
reflect the net effect of (a) temporary difference between carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial purposes and the amounts
used for income tax reporting purposes, and (b) net operating loss carry-forwards. No net provision for refundable Federal income tax
has been made in the accompanying statements of operations because no recoverable taxes were paid previously. Similarly, no deferred tax
asset attributable to the net operating loss carry-forward has been recognized, as it is not deemed likely to be realized. 

The income tax benefit for the years ended July
31, 2021 and 2020 consists of the following:

At July 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company had 2,356,937
and 2,282,553, respectively of the U.S. net operating losses (the U.S. NOLs ), which begin to expire beginning in 2034.
NOLs generated in tax years prior to July 31, 2018, can be carryforward for twenty years, whereas NOLs generated after July 31, 2018 can
be carryforward indefinitely. 

F- 9 

The Company assesses the likelihood that deferred
tax assets will not be realized. FASB ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes requires that a valuation allowance be established when
it is more likely than not that all, or a portion of, deferred tax assets will not be realized. A review of all available
positive and negative evidence needs to be considered, including the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future
taxable income, and tax planning strategies. After consideration of all the information available, management believes that uncertainty
exists with respect to future realization of its deferred tax assets and has, therefore, established a full valuation allowance as of
July 31, 2021 and 2020. 

The Company has not completed its evaluation of
NOL utilization limitation under IRC Section 382, change of ownership rules, but believes that it had a change of ownership that would
limit the amount of U.S. NOLs that could be utilized each year based on the Internal Revenue Code, as Amended. 

The Company s tax returns are subject to
examination by tax authorities beginning with the year ended July 31, 2017. 

NOTE 7 COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES 

The Company had no other commitments or contingencies as of July 31,
2021. 

From time to time the Company may become a party
to litigation matters involving claims against the Company. 

Management believes that it is adequately insured
for its operations and there are no current matters that would have a material effect on the Company's financial position or results
of operations.

Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants
on Accounting and Financial Disclosure 

There were no disagreements
with our accountants related to accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, internal controls or auditing scope
or procedure during the two fiscal years and subsequent interim periods. 

Item 9A. Controls and Procedures 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

We maintain disclosure
controls and procedures, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange
Act ), that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms, and that such information
is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer CEO )/Chief Financial Officer CFO ),
as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. We conducted an evaluation (the Evaluation ), under
the supervision and with the participation of our CEO/CFO of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls
and procedures Disclosure Controls as of the end of the period covered by this report pursuant to Rule 13a-15 of the Exchange
Act. Based on this evaluation and the existence of the material weaknesses discussed below in Management's Report on Internal
Control over Financial Reporting, our management, including our CEO/CFO concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures
were not effective at the reasonable assurance level as of the end of the period covered by this Report. 

We do not expect that our
disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all errors and all instances of fraud. Disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how
well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the disclosure controls and procedures
are met. Further, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the
benefits must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all disclosure controls and procedures, no
evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures can provide absolute assurance that we have detected all our control deficiencies and
instances of fraud, if any. The design of disclosure controls and procedures also is based partly on certain assumptions about the likelihood
of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future
conditions. 

Management's Report on Internal Control Over
Financial Reporting 

Our management is responsible
for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is defined
in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as a process designed by, or under the supervision
of, our principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by our Board, management and other personnel to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that: 

pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; 

provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and 

provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 

Because of its inherent limitations,
internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Additionally, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness
to future periods are subject to the risks that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

13 

Management assessed the effectiveness
of our internal control over financial reporting as of July 31, 2021. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth
by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) .
Based on this assessment, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of July 31, 2021,
due to the existence of the material weaknesses as of July 31, 2020, discussed below. A material weakness is a control deficiency, or
a combination of control deficiencies, that results in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim
financial statements will not be prevented or detected in the following areas: 

Because of the company s limited resources, there are limited controls over information processing. 

There is an inadequate segregation of duties consistent with control objectives. Our Company s management is composed of only one person, resulting in a situation where limitations on segregation of duties exist. In order to remedy this situation, we would need to hire additional staff to provide greater segregation of duties. Currently, it is not feasible to hire additional staff to obtain optimal segregation of duties. Management will reassess this matter in the following year to determine whether improvement in segregation of duty is feasible. 

The Company does not have a sitting audit committee financial expert, and as a result of the recent change in control, an audit committee, and thus the Company lacks the board oversight role within the financial reporting process. 

There is a lack of formal policies and procedures necessary to adequately review significant accounting transactions. The Company utilizes a third-party independent contractor for the preparation of its financial statements. Although the financial statements and footnotes are reviewed by our management, we do not have a formal policy to review significant accounting transactions and the accounting treatment of such transactions. The third-party independent contractor is not involved in the day to day operations of the Company and may not be provided information from management on a timely basis to allow for adequate reporting/consideration of certain transactions. 

Management believes that the
material weaknesses set forth above were the result of the scale of our operations and are intrinsic to our small size. Management believes
these weaknesses did not have a material effect on our financial results and intends to take remedial actions upon receiving funding for
the Company s business operations. 

Our management will continue
to monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of our internal controls and procedures and our internal controls over financial reporting on
an ongoing basis and is committed to taking further action and implementing additional enhancements or improvements, as necessary and
as funds allow. 

This Annual Report on Form
10-K does not include an attestation report of the Company s registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial
reporting due to permanent exemptions for smaller reporting companies. 

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting 

Other than as described above,
there have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 that have materially
affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

Because of its inherent limitations,
a system of internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance and may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Further, because of changes in conditions, effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting may vary over time. Our system
contains self-monitoring mechanisms, and actions are taken to correct deficiencies as they are identified. 

Item 9B. Other Information 

None.

Code of Ethics 

We have adopted a Code of
Business Conduct and Ethics that applies to, among other persons, members of our board of directors, our company's officers including
our president, chief executive officer and chief financial officer, employees, consultants and advisors. As adopted, our Code of Business
Conduct and Ethics sets forth written standards that are designed to deter wrongdoing and to promote: 

1. 
 honest and ethical conduct, including the ethical handling of actual or apparent conflicts of interest between personal and professional relationships; 

2. 
 full, fair, accurate, timely, and understandable disclosure in reports and documents that we file with, or submit to, the Securities and Exchange Commission and in other public communications made by us;

 compliance with applicable governmental laws, rules and regulations;

they maintain confidential information; and that they act with honesty and integrity.

Conduct and Ethics emphasizes that all employees, and particularly senior officers, have a responsibility for maintaining financial integrity
within our company, consistent with generally accepted accounting principles, and federal and state securities laws. Any senior officer,
who becomes aware of any incidents involving financial or accounting manipulation or other irregularities, whether by witnessing the incident
or being told of it, must report it to our company. Any failure to report such inappropriate or irregular conduct of others is to be treated
as a severe disciplinary matter. It is against our company policy to retaliate against any individual who reports in good faith the violation
or potential violation of our company's Code of Business Conduct and Ethics by another.

and Ethics was filed as Exhibit 14.1 to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal year ended July 31, 2013. We will provide a copy of

As of July 31, 2021, we did
not effect any material changes to the procedures by which our shareholders may recommend nominees to our board of directors. Our board
of directors does not have a policy with regards to the consideration of any director candidates recommended by our shareholders. Our
board of directors has determined that it is in the best position to evaluate our company s requirements as well as the qualifications
of each candidate when the board considers a nominee for a position on our board of directors. If shareholders wish to recommend candidates
directly to our board, they may do so by sending communications to the president of our company at the address on the cover of this annual
report. 

Corporate Governance Board Independence 

Our Board of Directors consists
of six directors. We have adopted a standard of director independence that conforms with the published listing requirements of the NASDAQ
Stock Market. All of our directors except for ZhiGang Pei are independent. As of the date hereof, we do not have a policy that a majority
of our board be comprised of independent directors. 

Prior to our change of control,
we had established an audit committee. We intend to establish a new audit committee in the future. We believe that members of our audit
committee will capable of analyzing and evaluating our financial statements and understanding internal controls and procedures for financial
reporting. We believe that retaining an independent director who would qualify as an audit committee financial expert would
be overly costly and burdensome and is not warranted in our circumstances given the early stages of our development and the fact that
we have not generated any material revenues to date. 

We have not yet established
a Nominating or Governance Committees as standing committees but expect to do so as our business matures. The Board does not have an executive
committee or any committees performing a similar function. We are not currently listed on a national securities exchange or in an inter-dealer
quotation system that has requirements that a majority of the board of directors be independent. All functions of a nominating/governance
committee were performed by our whole board of directors. Our board of directors intends to appoint such persons and form
such committees as are required to meet the corporate governance requirements imposed by the national securities exchanges as necessary. Our
board of directors does not believe that it is necessary to have such committees at the early stage of the company s development,
and our board of directors believes that the functions of such committees can be adequately performed by the members of our board of directors. 

18 

Involvement in Certain Legal Proceedings 

From time to time, we may
be involved in various claims, lawsuits, and disputes with third parties, actions involving allegations of discrimination or breach of
contract actions incidental to the normal operations of the business. We may be named as a defendant in such lawsuits and thus become
subject to the attendant risk of substantial damage awards. We believe that we have adequate liability insurance coverage. There can be
no assurance, however, that we will not be sued, that any such lawsuit will not exceed our insurance coverage, or that we will be able
to maintain such coverage at acceptable costs and on favorable terms. 

We are not a party to, nor
is any of our property the subject of, any legal proceedings. There are no proceedings pending in which any of our officers, directors
or 5 shareholders are adverse to us or any of our subsidiaries or in which they are taking a position or have a material interest that
is adverse to us or any of our subsidiaries. 

Item 11. Executive Compensation 

Compensation Philosophy and Objectives 

Currently, our executive
directors and officers do not receive compensation for services in such capacities. We expect to establish a compensation plan as our
company matures. We expect that our executive compensation philosophy will be to create a long-term direct relationship between pay and
our performance. Our executive compensation program will be designed to provide a balanced total compensation package over the executive s
career with us. The compensation program objectives will be to attract, motivate and retain the qualified executives that help ensure
our future success, to provide incentives for increasing our profits by awarding executives when corporate goals are achieved and to
align the interests of executives and long-term stockholders. We expect the compensation package of our named executive officers to consist
of two main elements: 

1. 
 base salary for our executives that is competitive relative to the market, and that reflects individual performance, retention and other relevant considerations; and 

2. 
 discretionary bonus awards payable in cash and tied to the satisfaction of corporate objectives. 

Process for Setting Executive Compensation 

As we do not have Compensation
Committee, our Board will be responsible for developing and overseeing the implementation of our philosophy with respect to the compensation
of executives and for monitoring the implementation and results of the compensation philosophy to ensure compensation remains competitive,
creates proper incentives to enhance stockholder value and rewards superior performance. The Board or Compensation Committee will annually
review and approve for each named executive officer, and particularly with regard to the Chief Executive Officer, all components of the
executive s compensation. The Board or Compensation Committee may award discretionary bonuses to each of the named executives, and
reviews and approves the process and factors (including individual and corporate performance measures and actual performance versus such
measures) used by the Chief Executive Officer to recommend such awards. Additionally, the Board or Compensation Committee will review
and approve the base salary, equity-incentive awards (if any) and any other special or supplemental benefits of the named executive officers. 

We expect out Chief Executive
Officer to periodically provide the Board or Compensation Committee with an evaluation of each named executive officer s performance,
based on the individual performance goals and objectives developed by the Chief Executive Officer at the beginning of the year, as well
as other factors. The Board of Compensation Committee will provide an evaluation for the Chief Executive Officer. These evaluations will
serve as the bases for bonus recommendations and changes in the compensation arrangements of our named executives. 

Our Compensation Peer Group 

We expect to engage in informal
market analysis in evaluating our executive compensation arrangements. As the Company and its businesses mature, we may retain compensation
consultants that will assist us in developing a formal benchmark and selecting a compensation peer group of companies similar to us in
size or business for the purpose of comparing executive compensation levels. 

19 

Program Components 

We expect our executive compensation
program to consist of the following elements: 

Base Salary 

Our base salary structure
will be designed to encourage internal growth, attract and retain new talent, and reward strong leadership that will sustain our growth
and profitability. The base salary for each named executive officer will reflect our past and current operating profits, the named executive
officer s individual contribution to our success throughout his career, internal pay equity and informal market data regarding comparable
positions within similarly situated companies. In determining and setting base salary, the Board/Compensation Committee will consider
all of these factors, though it will not assign specific weights to any factor. The Board/Compensation Committee will generally review
the base salary for each named executive officer on an annual basis. For each of our named executive officers, we expect to review base
salary data internally obtained by the Company for comparable executive positions in similarly situated companies to ensure that the base
salary rate for each executive is competitive relative to the market. 

Discretionary Bonus 

The objectives of our bonus
awards will be to encourage and reward our employees, including the named executive officers, who contribute to and participate in our
success by their ability, industry, leadership, loyalty or exceptional service and to recruit additional executives who will contribute
to that success. 

Each of our named executive
officers will be eligible for consideration for a discretionary cash bonus. The Chief Executive Officer will make recommendations regarding
bonus awards for the named executive officers and the Board/Compensation Committee provides the bonus recommendation for the Chief Executive
Officer. However, the Board/Compensation Committee will have sole and final authority and discretion in designating to whom awards are
made, the size of the award, if any, and its terms and conditions. The bonus recommendation for each of the named executive officers depends
on a number of factors, including (i) the performance of the Company for the year, (ii) the satisfaction of certain individual
and corporate performance measures, and (iii) other factors which the Compensation Committee may deem relevant. The Company did not
award any cash bonuses during fiscal year 2019. 

Stock Holdings 

The Board/Compensation Committee
recognizes the importance of having a portion of the named executive officers compensation be paid in the form of equity, to help
align the executives interests with the interests of the Company s stockholders. Initially, we expect the Board/Compensation
Committee to emphasize the cash-based portion of our compensation program over a stock program because it believes the discretionary nature
of the cash-based compensation gives it the needed flexibility to factor in and reward the attainment of longer-term goals for the Company
and the executives, as the Board/Compensation Committee deems appropriate. 

We have not timed nor do we
plan to time our release of material non-public information for the purpose of affecting the value of executive compensation. 

The following tables set forth,
for each of the last two completed fiscal years of the Company, the total compensation awarded to, earned by or paid to any person who
was a principal executive officer during the preceding fiscal year and every other highest compensated executive officers earning more
than 100,000 during the last fiscal year (together, the Named Executive Officers ). The tables set forth below reflect the
compensation of the Named Executive Officers.

an assessment of potential risks that may arise from our compensation programs. Based on this assessment, our Board concluded that our
policies and practices do not encourage excessive and unnecessary risk taking that would be reasonably likely to have material adverse
effect on the Company.
