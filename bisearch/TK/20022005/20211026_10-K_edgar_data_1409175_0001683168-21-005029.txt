CAUTIONARY NOTE CONCERNING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 

This Annual Report on Form
10-K includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and
Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended that are not historical facts, and involve risks and uncertainties that
could cause actual results to differ materially from those expected and projected. All statements, other than statements of historical
facts, included in this Form 10-K including, without limitation, statements in the Market Overview and Management s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations regarding the Company s market projections, financial
position, business strategy and the plans and objectives of management for future operations, events or developments which the Company
expects or anticipates will or may occur in the future, including such things as future capital expenditures (including the amount and
nature thereof); expansion and growth of the Company's business and operations; and other such matters are forward-looking statements.
These statements are based on certain assumptions and analyses made by the Company in light of its experience and its perception of historical
trends, current conditions and expected future developments, as well as other factors it believes are appropriate under the circumstances.
However, whether actual results or developments will conform with the Company's expectations and predictions is subject to a number of
risks and uncertainties, including general economic, market and business conditions; the business opportunities (or lack thereof) that
may be presented to and pursued by the Company; changes in laws or regulation; and other factors, most of which are beyond the control
of the Company. 

These forward-looking statements
can be identified by the use of predictive, future-tense or forward-looking terminology, such as believes, anticipates, 
 expects, estimates, plans, may, will, or similar terms. These statements appear
in a number of places in this filing and include statements regarding the intent, belief or current expectations of the Company, and its
directors or its officers with respect to, among other things: (i) trends affecting the Company's financial condition or results of operations
for its limited history; (ii) the Company's business and growth strategies; and, (iii) the Company's financing plans. Investors are cautioned
that any such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve significant risks and uncertainties, and
that actual results may differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements as a result of various factors. Such
factors that could adversely affect actual results and performance include, but are not limited to, the Company's limited operating history,
potential fluctuations in quarterly operating results and expenses, government regulation, technological change and competition. For information
identifying important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements,
please refer to the Risk Factors section of the Company s Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission (the SEC on June 11, 2018. 

Consequently, all of the forward-looking
statements made in this Form 10-K are qualified by these cautionary statements and there can be no assurance that the actual results or
developments anticipated by the Company will be realized or, even if substantially realized, that they will have the expected consequence
to or effects on the Company or its business or operations. The Company assumes no obligations to update any such forward-looking statements.

PART I 

ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

OVERVIEW 

We were an IT-solutions provider
that provided a multi-dimensional e-commerce platform to facilitate shopping, business, trade and integrates online office transactions
in a single application. Prior to June 2019, we developed and operated a mobile platform designed to consolidate users cash and
connect merchants to consumers by offering a cashless form of transaction, in-app shopping and a user rewards system. On June 2019, we
ceased the operation of the platform but continue to maintain our IT solution business operations. During the fiscal years ended July
31, 2020, and 2019, we generated comprehensive losses of 1,064,620 and 1,493,284, respectively. 

Since we ceased operations
of our platform June 2019, we unsuccessfully attempted to diversify into the energy, oil gas sector to strengthen our financial
position. Our current principal business is to achieve long-term growth potential through a combination with a business rather than immediate,
short-term earnings. Based on proposed business activities, we are a blank check company. We intend to comply with the periodic
reporting requirements of the Exchange Act for so long as it is subject to those requirements. 

As of the date of this Annual
Report, we have not entered into any binding agreement with any party regarding acquisition opportunities for us. We hope to continue
to engage in discussions with other operating businesses affiliated with our executive officers regarding potential acquisition opportunities.
There is no assurance that any nonbinding term sheet will result into a definitive purchase transaction nor can we assure you that we
will be able to successfully acquire such company or any company in the near future. 

The analysis of new business
opportunities will be undertaken by or under the supervision of the Company s officers. We have unrestricted flexibility in seeking,
analyzing and participating in potential business opportunities. In its efforts to analyze potential acquisition targets, we will consider
the following kinds of factors: 

Potential for growth, indicated by new technology, anticipated market expansion or new products; 

Competitive position as compared to other firms of similar size and experience within the industry segment as well as within the industry as a whole; 

Strength and diversity of management, either in place or scheduled for recruitment; 

Capital requirements and anticipated availability of required funds from the Registrant, from operations, through the sale of additional securities, through joint ventures or similar arrangements or from other sources; 

The extent to which the business opportunity can be advanced; 

The accessibility of required management expertise, personnel, raw materials, services, professional assistance and other required items; and 

Other relevant factors. 

In applying the foregoing
criteria, no one of which will be controlling, management will attempt to analyze all factors and circumstances and make a determination
based upon reasonable investigative measures and available data. Potentially available acquisition opportunities may occur in many different
industries, and at various stages of development, all of which will make the task of comparative investigation and analysis of such business
opportunities extremely difficult and complex. We may not discover or adequately evaluate adverse facts about the business to be acquired.
In evaluating a prospective business combination, we will conduct as extensive a due diligence review of potential targets as possible
given the lack of information that may be available regarding private companies, our limited personnel and financial resources. 

1 

We expect that our due diligence
will encompass, among other things, meetings with the target business s incumbent management and inspection of its facilities, as
necessary, as well as a review of financial and other information, which is made available to us. This due diligence review will be conducted
either by our management or by unaffiliated third parties we may engage. Our lack of funds and the lack of full-time management will likely
make it impracticable to conduct a complete and exhaustive investigation and analysis of a target business before we consummate a business
combination. Management decisions, therefore, will likely be made without detailed feasibility studies, independent analysis, market surveys
and the like which, if we had more funds available to us, would be desirable. We will be particularly dependent in making decisions upon
information provided by the promoters, owners, sponsors or others associated with the target business seeking our participation. 

The time and costs required
to select and evaluate a target business and to structure and complete a business combination cannot presently be ascertained with any
degree of certainty. Any costs incurred with respect to the indemnification and evaluation of a prospective business combination that
is not ultimately completed will result in a loss to us. 

Additionally, we are in a
highly competitive market for a small number of business opportunities, which could reduce the likelihood of consummating a successful
business combination. We are, and will continue to be, an insignificant participant in the business of seeking mergers with, joint ventures
with and acquisitions of small private and public entities. A large number of established and well-financed entities, including small
public companies and venture capital firms, are active in mergers and acquisitions of companies that may be desirable target candidates
for us. Nearly all these entities have significantly greater financial resources, technical expertise and managerial capabilities than
we do; consequently, we will be at a competitive disadvantage in identifying possible business opportunities and successfully completing
a business combination. These competitive factors may reduce the likelihood of our identifying and consummating a successful business
combination. 

HISTORY 

We were incorporated under
the laws of the State of Nevada on April 25, 2007. Prior to our acquisition of MIG Mobile Tech Berhad MMT ), a corporation
organized under the laws of Malaysia, we were an exploration stage company engaged in the acquisition and exploration of mineral properties.
We were also a shell company with no meaningful assets or operations other than our efforts to identify and merge with an
operating company. We operated under the name Contact Minerals Corp. and our securities traded under the symbol CNTM. 
Effective November 6, 2017, we changed our name to WECONNECT Tech International, Inc. and our symbol to WECT. 
Effective June 8, 2018, we consummated the acquisition of 49,831,007 shares of MMT (the MMT Shares ), constituting approximately
99.662 of the issued and outstanding securities of MMT. As a result of our acquisition of the MMT Shares, we ventured into the IT solution
business with a focus on users located in Malaysia. On June 2019, MMT ceased the operation of the platform and currently only maintains
its IT solution business operations. 

Effective August 29, 2017,
the Company and Kerry McCullagh, the Company s former Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, President, Secretary and
Treasurer (the Seller entered into a stock purchase agreement (the Stock Purchase Agreement with Shiong

Upon the consummation of the
sale, Kerry McCullagh, Alex Langer and William McCullagh, our former executive officers and directors, resigned from all of their positions

at a value of US 0.05 per share, for an aggregate value of US 24,915,503.50. As a result of our acquisition of the MMT Shares, we entered
into the payment solution business with a focus on users located in Malaysia. 

MMT was established in 2015
and commenced operations in Malaysia on October 2015. MMT had developed and operated a mobile platform designed to consolidate users 
cash and connect merchants to consumers by offering a cashless form of transaction, in-app shopping and a user rewards system. On June
2019, MMT ceased the operation of the platform. Our current principal business is to achieve long-term growth potential through a combination
with a business rather than immediate, short-term earnings.

the Sellers ), and Moto America, Inc.(the Buyer entered into a Sale and Purchase Agreement dated September

ITEM 3. Legal Proceedings . 

On November 12, 2018, MIG Mobile Tech Berhad,
a subsidiary of the Company, filed a claim against Digiland Private Limited Digiland for breach of contract and misrepresentation
arising from, among other things, Digiland s failure to perform under its supplier contract with the Company. In its suit, MIG Mobile
Tech Berhad is seeking a return of funds previously paid to Digiland in the amount of S 800,000 Singaporean Dollars (approximately US
 584,000) together with a claim for damages to be assessed by the Singapore Court. Within the same suit, Digiland has filed a counterclaim
against MIG Mobile Tech Berhad for the balance of the payment due to it under contract in the sum of S 800,000, together with a claim
for damages to be assessed by the Singapore Court. 

Prior to the filing of the its claims against
Digiland, the Company recognized the amount of 596,912 in receivable, deposits and prepayments. The amount is being recognized as deposit
because the development of the application-based software has not been materialized to-date. Subsequent to the filing of its claims, the
Company has recognized a full impairment in the amount of 596,612. 

As the COVID-19 pandemic had seriously affected
the economy and business environment worldwide, in view of the uncertainty on the recovery of the refund of deposit paid to Digiland and
the costs of prolonging the legal proceedings in light of the Company s limited resources, the Company discontinued its proceedings
on April 17, 2020. 

4 

On November 5, 2020, the Singapore Court awarded
a judgment in favor of Digiland, and as a result MIG Mobile Tech Berhad was ordered to pay: 

a) 
The Judgment Sum of S 800,000 

 b) 
Interest on the Judgment Sum at 5.33 per annum from 29th November 2018 to the date of payment; and 

 c) 
Legal costs of the action to be taxed if not agreed. 

Interest on the Judgment Sum calculated up to
February 16, 2021 is S 94,507.38. Digiland further claimed legal cost together with disbursement in the sum of S 79,616.88. The total
liabilities are estimated to be at S 974,124.26 and was accrued in the financial statement for the period ended July 31, 2020 and 2021. 

On June 20, 2021, the Corporation
and Ng Chee Chun, an individual Purchaser entered into that certain Share Sale Agreement pursuant to which the Corporation
sold to the Purchaser all shares of MMT held by the Corporation in consideration of Malaysia Ringgit One Thousand. The sale consummated
and was registered with the Malaysian Government pursuant to Section 51 of the Companies Act 2016 on August 24, 2021. As a result, MMT
is no longer a subsidiary of the Corporation, and the liabilities associated with the foregoing judgment will no longer be accrued on
our financial statements on a going forward basis.

that provided a multi-dimensional e-commerce platform to facilitate shopping, business, trade and integrates online office transactions
in a single application. Prior to June 2019, we developed and operated a mobile platform designed to consolidate users cash and
connect merchants to consumers by offering a cashless form of transaction, in-app shopping and a user rewards system. On June 2019, we
ceased the operation of the platform but continue to maintain our IT solution business operations through our wholly owned subsidiary,
MIG Mobile Tech (MMT). During the fiscal years ended July 31, 2020, and 2019, we generated comprehensive losses of 1,064,620 and 1,493,284,
respectively. 

Since we ceased operations
of our platform June 2019, we unsuccessfully attempted to diversify into the energy, oil gas sector to strengthen our financial
position. Our current principal business is to achieve long-term growth potential through a combination with a business rather than immediate,
short-term earnings. Based on proposed business activities, we are a blank check company. We intend to comply with the periodic
reporting requirements of the Exchange Act for so long as it is subject to those requirements. 

On June 20, 2021, the Corporation
and Ng Chee Chun, an individual Purchaser entered into that certain Share Sale Agreement pursuant to which the Corporation
sold to the Purchaser all shares of MMT held by the Corporation in consideration of Malaysia Ringgit One Thousand. The sale consummated
and was registered with the Malaysian Government pursuant to Section 51 of the Companies Act 2016 on August 24, 2021. As a result, MMT
is no longer a subsidiary of the Corporation. 

On September 27, 2021, the
Corporation, certain sellers of shares of our common stock, including our sole executive officer and director Shiong Han Wee (collectively,
the Sellers ), and Moto America, Inc.(the Buyer entered into a Sale and Purchase Agreement dated September
24, 2021, pursuant to which the Buyer agreed to purchase from the Sellers an aggregate of 436,482,690 shares of common stock of the Company
(the Common Shares and 10,000,000 shares of Series A Preferred Convertible Stock (the Preferred Shares ).
The Preferred Stock will be issued to Shiong Han Wee as payment in full of all amounts owed by the Company to Mr. Wee. The sale of the
Common Shares and the Preferred Shares is expected to consummate in the near future. The securities were sold pursuant to the exemption
provided by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Regulation D promulgated thereunder.

In connection with the sale
of such securities, all of the executive officers and directors of the Corporation will resign from their positions with the Corporation
and the following individuals will be appointed to serve in the capacities set forth next to their names as described below: 

Name 
 Position 
 
 Vance Harrison 
 Chief Executive Officer, President and Director 
 
 Terina Liddiard 
 Chief Financial Officer, Secretary and Director 
 
 Taylor Brody 
 Chief Marketing Officer and Director 

All executive officers and directors will also forgive
or waive all liabilities due to them from us in connection with such change in control. 

As of the date of this Annual
Report, we have not entered into any binding agreement with any party regarding acquisition opportunities for us. We hope to continue
to engage in discussions with other operating businesses affiliated with our executive officers regarding potential acquisition opportunities.
There is no assurance that any nonbinding term sheet will result into a definitive purchase transaction nor can we assure you that we
will be able to successfully acquire such company or any company in the near future. 

Financial Condition; Going Concern 

We have had limited operations
and have been issued a going concern opinion by our auditor, based upon our reliance on the sale of our common stock and
loans from a related party, as the sole source of funds for our future operations. We have no assurance that future financing will be
available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. If financing is not available on satisfactory terms, we may be unable to continue, develop
or expand our operations. Equity financing could result in additional dilution to existing shareholders. If we are unable to raise additional
capital to maintain our operations in the future, we may be unable to carry out our full business plan or we may be forced to cease operations. 

Our financial statements
have been prepared on a going concern basis which assumes the Company will be able to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities
in the normal course of business for the foreseeable future. As of July 31, 2021, the Company had working capital deficit of (2,321,872)
and has incurred losses since its inception resulting in an accumulated deficit of (7,667,225). Further losses are anticipated in the
development of the business, raising substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The financial
statements do not include any adjustment that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

The ability to continue as
a going concern is dependent upon the Company generating profitable operations in the future and/or to obtain the necessary financing
to meet its obligations and repay its liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due. Management intends to finance
operating costs over the next twelve months with loans from directors and/or private placements of common stock.

Net Cash Used In Investing

Net cash used in investing
activities for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2020 was 126, consisting of proceeds from the disposal of property and equipment. 

Net Cash Generated From
Financing Activities 

There is no net cash generated
from financing activities for the fiscal years ended July 31, 2021, and 2020. 

We have never paid dividends
on our Common Stock. Our present policy is to apply cash to investments in product development, acquisitions or expansion; consequently,
we do not expect to pay dividends on Common Stock in the foreseeable future. 

The success of our business
plan is dependent upon the availability of additional capital resources on terms satisfactory to management as we are not generating
sufficient revenues from our business operations. Our sources of capital in the past have included the sale of equity securities, which
include common stock sold in private transactions and public offerings, capital leases and long-term debt. There can be no assurance
that we can raise such additional capital resources on satisfactory terms. At this moment, we do not have enough cash and other sources
of liquidity to support operations for the next 12 months. We anticipate continuing to rely on equity sales of our common shares and
shareholder loans in order to continue to fund our business operations. Issuances of additional shares will result in dilution to our
existing shareholders. There is no assurance that we will achieve any additional sales of our equity securities or arrange for debt or
other financing to fund our plan of operations. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

We have no outstanding off-balance
sheet guarantees, interest rate swap transactions or foreign currency contracts. We do not engage in trading activities involving non-exchange
traded contracts.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 

The preparation of financial
statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires our management to make assumptions,
estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported, including the notes thereto, and related disclosures of commitments and contingencies,
if any. We have identified certain accounting policies that are significant to the preparation of our financial statements. These accounting
policies are important for an understanding of our financial condition and results of operations. Critical accounting policies are those
that are most important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and require management's subjective or
complex judgment, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change
in subsequent periods. Certain accounting estimates are particularly sensitive because of their significance to financial statements and
because of the possibility that future events affecting the estimate may differ significantly from management's current judgments. 

Use of estimates 

The preparation of financial statements in conformity
with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts
of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 

Revenue recognition 

Revenue is recognized when a customer obtains
control of promised goods or services and is recognized in an amount that reflects the consideration that an entity expects to receive
in exchange for those goods or services. In addition, the standard requires disclosure of the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty
of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. The amount of revenue that is recorded reflects the consideration that
the Company expects to receive in exchange for those goods. The Company applies the following five-step model in order to determine this
amount: (i) identification of the promised goods in the contract; (ii) determination of whether the promised goods are performance obligations,
including whether they are distinct in the context of the contract; (iii) measurement of the transaction price, including the constraint
on variable consideration; (iv) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations; and (v) recognition of revenue when
(or as) the Company satisfies each performance obligation. 

Fair value Measurements 

Fair value is the price that would be received
from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Fair
value is estimated by applying the following hierarchy, which prioritize the inputs used to measure fair value into three levels and bases
the categorization with the hierarchy upon the lowest level of input that is available and significant to the fair value measurement. 

The fair value hierarchy consists of three broad
levels, which gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and
the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3). 

The three levels of the fair value hierarchy under
ASC 820 are described below: 

Level 1 - 
 Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities. 

Level 2 - 
 Inputs, other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, including quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability (e.g. interest rates); and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means. 

Level 3 - 
 Inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable. 

11 

The Company s cash and cash equivalents
and short-term investments are classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy because they are valued using quoted market prices.
The carrying amounts of accounts payable, advances payable and short-term loans approximate their fair value due to short term maturities. 

Foreign currencies translation 

Transactions denominated in currencies other than
the functional currency are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are translated into the functional currency
using the applicable exchange rates at the balance sheet dates. The resulting exchange differences are recorded in the statement of operations. 

The functional currency of the Company is the
United States Dollars US and the accompanying financial statements have been expressed in US . In addition, the subsidiary
maintains its books and record in a local currency, Malaysian Ringgit MYR or RM ), which is functional currency
as being the primary currency of the economic environment in which the entity operates. 

In general, for consolidation purposes, assets
and liabilities of its subsidiaries whose functional currency is not US are translated into US , in accordance with ASC Topic 830-30,
 Translation of Financial Statement , using the exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Revenues and expenses are translated
at average rates prevailing during the period. The gains and losses resulting from translation of financial statements of foreign subsidiary
are recorded as a separate component of other comprehensive income. The Company has not to, the date of these financial statements, entered
into derivative instruments to offset the impact of foreign currency fluctuations. 

Translation of amounts from the local currency
of the Company into US 1 has been made at the following exchange rates for the respective years:

Recent accounting pronouncements 

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,
 Leases (Topic 842) . ASU 2016-02 requires lessees to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and
requires expanded disclosures about leasing arrangements. ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018
and interim periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. The Company has adopted this
accounting standard update. 

On June 20, 2018, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2018-07, Compensation Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements
to Nonemployee Share-Based Payment Accounting . ASU 2018-07 is intended to reduce cost and complexity and to improve financial reporting
for share-based payments to nonemployees (for example, service providers, external legal counsel, suppliers, etc.). Under the new standard,
companies will no longer be required to value non-employee awards differently from employee awards. Meaning that companies will value
all equity classified awards at their grant-date under ASC718 and forgo revaluing the award after this date. The guidance is effective
for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018. 

12 

In November 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-10,
Financial Instruments Credit Losses (Topic 326), Derivative and Hedging (Topic 815, and Leases (Topic 841). This new guidance will
be effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those annual reporting periods.
While the Company is continuing to assess the potential impacts of ASU 2019-10, it does not expect ASU 2019-10 to have a material effect
on its financial statements. 

The Company has implemented all new accounting
pronouncements that are in effect. These pronouncements did not have any material impact on the financial statements unless otherwise
disclosed, and the Company does not believe that there are any other new accounting pronouncements that have been issued that might have
a material impact on its financial position or results of operations.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting
Firm 

 To the shareholders and
the board of directors of WeConnect Tech International, Inc. 

Opinion on the Financial Statements 

 We have audited the accompanying balance sheets
of WeConnect Tech International Inc (the Company as of July 31, 2021, the related consolidated statements
of operations, changes in shareholders' equity and cash flows , for each of the two years in the period ended July 31, 2021, and
the related notes collectively referred to as the financial statements 

In our opinion, the financial statements present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of July 31, 2021, and the results of its operations and its
cash flows for the year ended July 31, 2021, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 

Going Concern 

 The accompanying financial statements have been
prepared assuming the company will continue as a going concern as disclosed in Note 5 to the financial statement, the Company has continuously
incurred a net operating loss of 28,722 for the year ended July 31, 2021, and an accumulated deficit of 7,667,225 at July 31, 2021.
The continuation of the Company as a going concern through July 31, 2021, is dependent upon improving the profitability and the continuing
financial support from its stockholders. Management believes the existing shareholders or external financing will provide the additional
cash to meet the Company s obligations as they become due. 

These factors raise substantial doubt about the
company ability to continue as a going concern. These financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome
of the uncertainty. 

Basis for Opinion 

 These financial statements are the responsibility
of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We
are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) PCAOB and are
required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and
regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB.
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free
of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement
of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included
examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating
the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial
statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. . The company is not required to have, nor were we
engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding
of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal
control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion 

Critical Audit Matters 

 Critical audit matters communicated below are
matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the
audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially
challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. We determined that there are no critical audit matter.

NOTE
2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 

Basis of presentation 

 The Company s consolidated financial statements
have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America U.S. GAAP ). 

Use of estimates 

 The preparation of financial statements in conformity
with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts
of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 

Concentrations of Credit Risk 

 We maintain our cash in bank deposit accounts,
the balances of which at times may exceed federally insured limits. We continually monitor our banking relationships and consequently
have not experienced any losses in our accounts. We believe we are not exposed to any significant credit risk on cash. 

Cash equivalents 

 The Company considers all highly liquid investments
with a maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. There were no cash equivalents for the years ended July
31, 2020 or 2019. 

F- 6 

Inventories 

 Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or
net realizable value. In general cost is determined by applying either the first in first out (FIFO) or percentages mark-up to the selling
price valuations for the inventory item. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less
selling expenses. Allowances is made for obsolete, slow moving and defective inventories. All of the Company s inventories consists
of merchandise held for sale. 

Net income (loss) per common share 

 Net income (loss) per common share is computed
pursuant to section 260-10-45 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification. Basic net income (loss) per common share is computed
by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted net income
(loss) per common share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of shares of common stock and potentially
outstanding shares of common stock during the period. The weighted average number of common shares outstanding and potentially outstanding
common shares assumes that the Company incorporated as of the beginning of the first period presented. There are no potentially dilutive
shares of common stock. 

Revenue recognition 

 Revenue is recognized when a customer obtains
control of promised goods or services and is recognized in an amount that reflects the consideration that an entity expects to receive
in exchange for those goods or services. In addition, the standard requires disclosure of the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty
of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. The amount of revenue that is recorded reflects the consideration that
the Company expects to receive in exchange for those goods. The Company applies the following five-step model in order to determine this
amount: (i) identification of the promised goods in the contract; (ii) determination of whether the promised goods are performance
obligations, including whether they are distinct in the context of the contract; (iii) measurement of the transaction price, including
the constraint on variable consideration; (iv) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations; and (v) recognition
of revenue when (or as) the Company satisfies each performance obligation. 

Comprehensive Income 

 ASC Topic 220, Comprehensive Income 
establishes standards for reporting and display of comprehensive income, its components and accumulated balances. Comprehensive income
as defined includes all changes in equity during a period from non-owner sources. Accumulated other comprehensive income, as presented
in the accompanying statements of stockholders equity consists of changes in unrealized gains and losses on foreign currency translation
and cumulative net change in the fair value of available-for-sale investments held at the balance sheet date. This comprehensive income
is not included in the computation of income tax expense or benefit. 

Accounts receivable 

 Accounts receivable, which generally have thirty-day
terms are recognized and carried at original invoice amount, less an allowance for uncollectible amounts, if applicable. 

The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful
accounts at a level considered adequate to provide for potential uncollectible receivables. The level of this allowance is evaluated by
management based on collection experience and other factors affecting the accounts such as customer relationship and market factors. 

Taxes 

 Potential benefits of income tax losses are not
recognized in the accounts until realization is more likely than not. The Company computes tax asset benefits for net operating losses
carried forward. The potential benefits of net operating losses have not been recognized in these financial statements because the Company
cannot be assured it is more likely than not it will utilize the net operating losses carried forward in future year. 

The company conducts major businesses in Malaysia
and is subject to tax in their own jurisdiction. As a result of its business activities, the company will file separate tax returns that
are subject to examination by the foreign tax authorities. 

F- 7 

Fair
Value Measurements 

 Fair value
is the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants
at the measurement date. Fair value is estimated by applying the following hierarchy, which prioritize the inputs used to measure
fair value into three levels and bases the categorization with the hierarchy upon the lowest level of input that is available and significant
to the fair value measurement. 

The fair
value hierarchy consists of three broad levels, which gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical
assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3). 

The three
levels of the fair value hierarchy under ASC 820 are described below: 

Level 1
- Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities. 

Level 2
- Inputs, other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly,
including quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities
in markets that are not active; inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability (e.g. interest rates);
and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means. 

Level 3
- Inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable. 

The Company s
cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments are classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy because they are valued
using quoted market prices. The carrying amounts of accounts payable, advances payable and short-term loans approximate their fair
value due to short term maturities. 

Recently issued accounting pronouncements 

 In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,
 Leases (Topic 842) . ASU 2016-02 requires lessees to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and
requires expanded disclosures about leasing arrangements. ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018
and interim periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. The Company has adopted this
accounting standard update. 

On June 20, 2018, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2018-07, Compensation Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements
to Nonemployee Share-Based Payment Accounting . ASU 2018-07 is intended to reduce cost and complexity and to improve financial reporting
for share-based payments to nonemployees (for example, service providers, external legal counsel, suppliers, etc.). Under the new standard,
companies will no longer be required to value non-employee awards differently from employee awards. Meaning that companies will value
all equity classified awards at their grant-date under ASC718 and forgo revaluing the award after this date. The guidance is effective
for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018. 

In November 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-10,
Financial Instruments Credit Losses (Topic 326), Derivative and Hedging (Topic 815, and Leases (Topic 841). This new guidance will
be effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those annual reporting periods.
While the Company is continuing to assess the potential impacts of ASU 2019-10, it does not expect ASU 2019-10 to have a material effect
on its financial statements. 

F- 8 

The Company has implemented all new accounting
pronouncements that are in effect. These pronouncements did not have any material impact on the financial statements unless otherwise
disclosed, and the Company does not believe that there are any other new accounting pronouncements that have been issued that might have
a material impact on its financial position or results of operations. 

Foreign currency translation 

 Transactions denominated in currencies other than
the functional currency are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are translated into the functional currency
using the applicable exchange rates at the balance sheet dates. The resulting exchange differences are recorded in the statement of operations. 

The functional currency of the Company is the
United States Dollars US and the accompanying financial statements have been expressed in US . In addition, the subsidiary
maintains its books and record in a local currency, Malaysian Ringgit MYR or RM ), which is functional currency
as being the primary currency of the economic environment in which the entity operates. 

In general, for consolidation purposes, assets
and liabilities of its subsidiaries whose functional currency is not US are translated into US , in accordance with ASC Topic 830-30,
 Translation of Financial Statement , using the exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Revenues and expenses are translated
at average rates prevailing during the period. The gains and losses resulting from translation of financial statements of foreign subsidiary
are recorded as a separate component of other comprehensive income. The Company has not to, the date of these financial statements, entered
into derivative instruments to offset the impact of foreign currency fluctuations. 

Translation of amounts from the local currency
of the Company into US 1 has been made at the following exchange rates for the respective years: 

For the Years Ended July 31,

NOTE 3 PROPERTY AND
EQUIPMENT 

Property and Equipment are first recorded at cost.
Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the various classes of assets. 

Long lived assets, including property and equipment,
to be held and used by the Company are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
value of the assets may not be recoverable. Impairment losses are recognized if expected future cash flows of the related assets are less
than their carrying values. Measurement of an impairment loss is based on the fair value of the asset. Long-lived assets to be disposed
of are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell. 

Maintenance and repair expenses, as incurred,
are charged to expense. Betterments and renewals are capitalized in plant and equipment accounts. Cost and accumulated depreciation applicable
to items replaced or retired are eliminated from the related accounts with any gain or loss on the disposition included as income.

NOTE 5 GOING CONCERN 

The accompanying financial statements have been
prepared using the going concern basis of accounting, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities
in the normal course of business. 

As of July 31, 2020, the Company suffered an accumulated
deficit of 7,667,225 and continuously incurred a net operating loss of 28,722 for year ended July 31, 2021. The continuation of the
Company as a going concern through July 31, 2021 is dependent upon improving the profitability and the continuing financial support from
its stockholders. Management believes the existing shareholders or external financing will provide the additional cash to meet the Company s
obligations as they become due. 

These and other factors raise substantial doubt
about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. These financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect
the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that
may result in the Company not being able to continue as a going concern. 

NOTE 6 CONTINGENT
LIABILITY 

On November 12, 2018, MIG Mobile Tech Berhad,
a subsidiary of the Company, filed a claim against Digiland Private Limited Digiland for breach of contract and misrepresentation
arising from, among other things, Digiland s failure to perform under its supplier contract with the Company. In its suit, MIG Mobile
Tech Berhad is seeking a return of funds previously paid to Digiland in the amount of S 800,000 Singaporean Dollars (approximately US
 584,000) together with a claim for damages to be assessed by the Singapore Court. Within the same suit, Digiland has filed a counterclaim
against MIG Mobile Tech Berhad for the balance of the payment due to it under contract in the sum of S 800,000, together with a claim
for damages to be assessed by the Singapore Court. 

F- 11 

Prior to the filing of the its claims against
Digiland, the Company recognized the amount of 596,912 in receivable, deposits and prepayments. The amount is being recognized as deposit
because the development of the application-based software has not been materialized to-date. Subsequent to the filing of its claims, the
Company has recognized a full impairment in the amount of 596,612. 

As the COVID-19 pandemic had seriously affected
the economy and business environment worldwide, in view of the uncertainty on the recovery of the refund of deposit paid to Digiland and
the costs of prolonging the legal proceedings in light of the Company s limited resources, the Company discontinued its proceedings
on April 17, 2020. 

On November 5, 2020, the Singapore Court awarded
a judgment in favor of Digiland, and as a result, MIG Mobile Tech Berhad was ordered to pay: 

a) 
 The Judgment Sum of S 800,000 

b) 
 Interest on the Judgment Sum at 5.33 per annum from 29th November 2018 to the date of payment; and 

c) 
 Legal costs of the action to be taxed if not agreed. 

Interest on the Judgment Sum calculated up to
February 16, 2021 is S 94,507.38. Digiland further claimed legal cost together with disbursement in the sum of S 79,616.88. The total
liabilities is estimated to be at S 974,124.26 and was accrued in the financial statement for the period ended July 31, 2020. No further
liabilities were accrued in the financial statement for the period ended July 31, 2021. 

On June 20, 2021, we and Ng Chee Chun, an individual Purchaser entered into that certain Share Sale Agreement pursuant to which the Corporation sold to the Purchaser all shares
of MIG Mobile Tech Bhd held by the Corporation in consideration of Malaysia Ringgit One Thousand. The sale consummated and was registered
with the Malaysian Government pursuant to Section 51 of the Companies Act 2016 on August 24, 2021. As a result, MIG Mobile Tech Bhd is
no longer a subsidiary of the Corporation, and the liabilities associated with the foregoing judgment will no longer be accrued on our
financial statements on a going forward basis. 

NOTE 7 COMMITMENTS
AND CONTINGENCIES. 

When a loss contingency is not both probable and
estimable, the Company does not establish an accrued liability. However, if the loss (or an additional loss in excess of the accrual)
is at least a reasonable possibility and material, then the Company discloses an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss, if such
estimate can be made or discloses that an estimate cannot be made. 

The assessments whether a loss is probable or
a reasonable possibility, and whether the loss or a range of loss is estimable, often involve a series of complex judgments about future
events. Management is often unable to estimate a range of reasonably possible loss, particularly where (i) the damages sought are
substantial or indeterminate, (ii) the proceedings are in the early stages, or (iii) the matters involve novel or unsettled
legal theories or a large number of parties. In such cases, there is considerable uncertainty regarding the timing or ultimate resolution
of such matters, therefore, no contingencies were provided as at July 31, 2021. 

NOTE 8 - SUBSEQUENT EVENTS 

On June 20, 2021, the Corporation
and Ng Chee Chun, an individual Purchaser entered into that certain Share Sale Agreement pursuant to which the Corporation
sold to the Purchaser all shares of MMT held by the Corporation in consideration of Malaysia Ringgit One Thousand. The sale consummated
and was registered with the Malaysian Government pursuant to Section 51 of the Companies Act 2016 on August 24, 2021. As a result, MMT
is no longer a subsidiary of the Corporation in the next fiscal year ended July 31, 2022. 

F- 12 

On September 27, 2021, the Corporation, certain
sellers of shares of our common stock, including our sole executive officer and director Shiong Han Wee (collectively, the Sellers ),

to Shiong Han Wee as payment in full of all amounts owed by the Company to Mr. Wee. The securities were sold pursuant to the exemption

Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

As of the end of the period
covered by this report, our management conducted an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such
term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act). Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive

periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by
the Company in such reports is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and
Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Management s Report on Internal Control
over Financial Reporting 

Our management is responsible
for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the

Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on that
evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of July 31, 2021. 

This annual report does not
include an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management s
report was not subject to attestation by our registered public accounting firm pursuant to rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission

Changes in Internal Control over Financial
Reporting

of fiscal 2021, there were no changes in the internal control over financial reporting that materially affected, or are reasonably likely
to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

Inherent Limitations of Disclosure Controls
and Procedures and Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

It should be noted that any
system of controls, however well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, and not absolute, assurance that the objectives of
the system will be met. In addition, the design of any control system is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of
future events.

No executive officer or director

Board Committees 

Effective September 22,
2017, we formed an Audit Committee. As a result of the change in control, there are currently no directors serving on the audit committee.
We hope to appoint directors to serve on the audit committee after we acquire an operating business. A copy of the charter for our Audit
Committee is filed as Exhibit 99.1. 

16 

We have not formed separate
Corporate Governance and Compensation and Nominations committees. Our entire Board performs the functions of the Corporate Governance
and Compensation and Nominations committees. We hope to establish these committees as the business of the Company becomes more mature. 

Code of Ethics 

We adopted a Code of Ethics
applicable to our officers and directors, which is a code of ethics as defined by applicable rules of the SEC. If we make
any amendments to our Code of Ethics other than technical, administrative, or other non-substantive amendments, or grant any waivers,
including implicit waivers, from a provision of our Code of Ethics to our officers or directors, we will disclose the nature of the amendment
or waiver, its effective date and to whom it applies in a Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC. 

ITEM 11. Executive
Compensation. 

Compensation Philosophy and Objectives 

Currently, our executive directors
and officers do not receive compensation for services in such capacities. We expect to establish a compensation plan as our company matures.
We expect that our executive compensation philosophy will be to create a long-term direct relationship between pay and our performance.
Our executive compensation program will be designed to provide a balanced total compensation package over the executive s career
with us. The compensation program objectives will be to attract, motivate and retain the qualified executives that help ensure our future
success, to provide incentives for increasing our profits by awarding executives when corporate goals are achieved and to align the interests
of executives and long-term stockholders. We expect the compensation package of our named executive officers to consist of two main elements: 

1. 
 base salary for our executives that is competitive relative to the market, and that reflects individual performance, retention and other relevant considerations; and 

2. 
 discretionary bonus awards payable in cash and tied to the satisfaction of corporate objectives. 

Process for Setting Executive Compensation 

As we do not have Compensation
Committee, our Board will be responsible for developing and overseeing the implementation of our philosophy with respect to the compensation
of executives and for monitoring the implementation and results of the compensation philosophy to ensure compensation remains competitive,
creates proper incentives to enhance stockholder value and rewards superior performance. The Board or Compensation Committee will annually
review and approve for each named executive officer, and particularly with regard to the Chief Executive Officer, all components of the
executive s compensation. The Board or Compensation Committee may award discretionary bonuses to each of the named executives, and
reviews and approves the process and factors (including individual and corporate performance measures and actual performance versus such
measures) used by the Chief Executive Officer to recommend such awards. Additionally, the Board or Compensation Committee will review
and approve the base salary, equity-incentive awards (if any) and any other special or supplemental benefits of the named executive officers. 

We expect out Chief Executive
Officer to periodically provide the Board or Compensation Committee with an evaluation of each named executive officer s performance,
based on the individual performance goals and objectives developed by the Chief Executive Officer at the beginning of the year, as well
as other factors. The Board of Compensation Committee will provide an evaluation for the Chief Executive Officer. These evaluations will
serve as the bases for bonus recommendations and changes in the compensation arrangements of our named executives. 

17 

Our Compensation Peer Group 

We expect to engage in informal
market analysis in evaluating our executive compensation arrangements. As the Company and its businesses mature, we may retain compensation
consultants that will assist us in developing a formal benchmark and selecting a compensation peer group of companies similar to us in
size or business for the purpose of comparing executive compensation levels. 

Program Components 

We expect our executive compensation
program to consist of the following elements: 

Base Salary 

Our base salary structure
will be designed to encourage internal growth, attract and retain new talent, and reward strong leadership that will sustain our growth
and profitability. The base salary for each named executive officer will reflect our past and current operating profits, the named executive
officer s individual contribution to our success throughout his career, internal pay equity and informal market data regarding comparable
positions within similarly situated companies. In determining and setting base salary, the Board/Compensation Committee will consider
all of these factors, though it will not assign specific weights to any factor. The Board/Compensation Committee will generally review
the base salary for each named executive officer on an annual basis. For each of our named executive officers, we expect to review base
salary data internally obtained by the Company for comparable executive positions in similarly situated companies to ensure that the base
salary rate for each executive is competitive relative to the market. 

Discretionary Bonus 

The objectives of our bonus
awards will be to encourage and reward our employees, including the named executive officers, who contribute to and participate in our
success by their ability, industry, leadership, loyalty or exceptional service and to recruit additional executives who will contribute
to that success. 

Each of our named executive
officers will be eligible for consideration for a discretionary cash bonus. The Chief Executive Officer will make recommendations regarding
bonus awards for the named executive officers and the Board/Compensation Committee provides the bonus recommendation for the Chief Executive
Officer. However, the Board/Compensation Committee will have sole and final authority and discretion in designating to whom awards are
made, the size of the award, if any, and its terms and conditions. The bonus recommendation for each of the named executive officers depends
on a number of factors, including (i) the performance of the Company for the year, (ii) the satisfaction of certain individual
and corporate performance measures, and (iii) other factors which the Board/Compensation Committee may deem relevant. The Company
did not award any cash bonuses during fiscal year 2019. 

Stock Holdings 

The Board/Compensation Committee
recognizes the importance of having a portion of the named executive officers compensation be paid in the form of equity, to help
align the executives interests with the interests of the Company s stockholders. Initially, we expect the Board/Compensation
Committee to emphasize the cash-based portion of our compensation program over a stock program because it believes the discretionary nature
of the cash-based compensation gives it the needed flexibility to factor in and reward the attainment of longer-term goals for the Company
and the executives, as the Board/Compensation Committee deems appropriate. 

We have not timed, nor do
we plan to time our release of material non-public information for the purpose of affecting the value of executive compensation.

Other than set out above and

Our directors and executive officers may receive share options at the discretion of our board of directors in the future. We do not have
any material bonus or profit sharing plans pursuant to which cash or non-cash compensation is or may be paid to our directors or executive
officers, except that share options may be granted at the discretion of our board of directors. 

Equity Awards 

There are no options, warrants
or convertible securities outstanding. At no time during the last fiscal year with respect to any of our executive officers was there: 

any outstanding option or other equity-based award repriced or otherwise materially modified (such as by extension of exercise periods, the change of vesting or forfeiture conditions, the change or elimination of applicable performance criteria, or the change of the bases upon which returns are determined); 

any waiver or modification of any specified performance target, goal or condition to payout with respect to any amount included in non-stock incentive plan compensation or payouts;

any payment for any item to be included under All Other Compensation in the Summary Compensation Table. 

Director Compensation Table 

During our fiscal year ended
July 31, 2021, we did not provide compensation to any of our employee directors for serving as our director. We currently have no formal
plan for compensating our employee directors for their services in their capacity as directors, although we may elect to issue stock
options to such persons from time to time. 

Non-Employee Director Fees 

Our Compensation Committee
and Board determines the form and amount of compensation for our non-employee directors based on informal surveys of similar companies
and the amount necessary to attract and retain such directors. For the fiscal year ended July 31, 2021, we accrued the fee for each of

Compensation Risk Management 

Our Board of directors and
human resources staff conducted an assessment of potential risks that may arise from our compensation programs. Based on this assessment,
we concluded that our policies and practices do not encourage excessive and unnecessary risk taking that would be reasonably likely to
have material adverse effect on the Company. The assessment included our cash incentive programs, which awards non-executives with cash
bonuses for punctuality. Our compensation programs are substantially identical among business units, corporate functions and global locations
(with modifications to comply with local regulations as appropriate). The risk-mitigating factors considered in this assessment included: 

the alignment of pay philosophy, peer group companies and compensation amount relative to local competitive practices to support our business objectives; and 

effective balance of cash, short- and long-term performance periods, caps on performance-based award schedules and financial metrics with individual factors and Board and management discretion.

Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider

a Compensation Committee. Our Board of Directors performs the functions that would be performed by a compensation committee. 

During the fiscal year ended

Director Independence 

Our board of directors is
currently composed of four members, two of whom do not qualify as an independent director in accordance with the published listing requirements
of the NASDAQ Stock Market. The NASDAQ independence definition includes a series of objective tests, such as that the director is not,
and has not been for at least three years, one of our employees and that neither the director, nor any of his family members has engaged
in various types of business dealings with us. In addition, our board of directors has not made a subjective determination as to each
director that no relationships exist which, in the opinion of our board of directors, would interfere with the exercise of independent
judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director, though such subjective determination is required by the NASDAQ rules. Had
our board of directors made these determinations, our board of directors would have reviewed and discussed information provided by the
directors and us with regard to each director s business and personal activities and relationships as they may relate to us and
our management.
