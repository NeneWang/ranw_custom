 ESSA Bank & Trust 
 General 
 The Bank was organized in 1916. The Bank is a Pennsylvania chartered full-service, community-oriented savings bank. We provide financial services to individuals, families and businesses through our 21 community offices, located in Monroe, Northampton, Lehigh, Lackawanna, Luzerne, Chester, Delaware and Montgomery Counties, Pennsylvania. The Bank is subject to comprehensive regulation and examination by the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. In March 2014, the Bank converted its charter from a Pennsylvania savings and loan association to a Pennsylvania savings bank. The charter change did not have a material effect on the operations of the Bank. 
 The Bank s business consists primarily of accepting deposits from the general public and investing those deposits, together with funds generated from operations and borrowings, in residential first mortgage loans (including construction mortgage loans), commercial real estate loans, home equity loans and lines of credit and commercial and industrial loans. We offer a variety of deposit accounts, including checking, savings and certificates of deposits. We also offer asset management and trust services. We offer investment services through our relationship with Ameriprise Financial Services, LLC, a third-party broker/dealer and registered investment advisor. We offer insurance benefit consulting services through our wholly owned subsidiary, ESSA Advisory Services, LLC. 
 The Bank s executive offices are located at 200 Palmer Street, Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania 18360. Our telephone number at this address is (570) 421-0531. Our website address is www.essabank.com . 
 Market Area 
 At September 30, 2021, our 21 community offices consisted of seven offices in Monroe County, three offices in Lehigh County, five offices in Northampton County, one office in Lackawanna County, one office in Luzerne County, one office in Chester County, two offices in Delaware County and one office in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania. Our primary market for deposits is currently concentrated around the areas where our full-service banking offices are located.

 Monroe County is located in eastern Pennsylvania, situated 90 miles north of Philadelphia, 75 miles west of New York and 116 miles northeast of Harrisburg. Monroe County is comprised of 611 square miles of mostly rural terrain. Major industries include tou rism, healthcare and educational facilities. Northampton County is located south of Monroe County and directly borders New Jersey. Lehigh County is located southwest of Monroe County. Luzerne and Lackawanna Counties are located north of Monroe County. Chester and Montgomery Counties are located south and Delaware County southwest of Monroe County.

 Lending Activities 
 Historically, our principal lending activity had been the origination of first mortgage loans for the purchase, construction or refinancing of one- to four-family residential real estate property. For years, we have been increasing our originations of commercial loans and commercial real estate loans in an effort to increase interest income, diversify our loan portfolio, and better serve the community. Commercial real estate loans have increased from 480.6 million or 35.8 of our total loan portfolio at September 30, 2019 to 591.1 million, or 43.4 , of our total loan portfolio at September 30, 2021. One- to four-family residential real estate mortgage loans represented 580.3 million, or 42.7 of our loan portfolio at September 30, 2021. Home equity loans and lines of credit totaled 38.4 million, or 2.8 , of our loan portfolio at September 30, 2021. Commercial loans totaled 63.5 million, or 4.7 , of our loan portfolio at September 30, 2021 and construction first mortgage loans totaled 14.0 million, or 1.0 , of the total loan portfolio at September 30, 2021. Commercial loans include approximately 22.6 million in Paycheck Protection Program PPP loans which provide relief to small businesses affected by the pandemic. Obligations of states and political subdivisions totaled 56.2 million, or 4.1 , of our loan portfolio at September 30, 2021.

Loan Originations and Repayments. We originate residential mortgage loans pursuant to underwriting standards that generally conform to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac guidelines. Loan origination activities are primarily concentrated in Monroe, Northampton, Lehigh, Lackawanna, Luzerne, Chester, Delaware, and Montgomery Counties, Pennsylvania and secondarily in other Pennsylvania counties contiguous to our primary market area. New loans are generated primarily from the efforts of employees and advertising, a network of select mortgage brokers, other parties with whom we do business, customer referrals, and from walk-in customers. Loan applications are centrally underwritten and processed at our corporate center. At September 30, 2021, 580.3 million, or 42.7 , of our loan portfolio, consisted of one- to four-family residential loans. Generally, one- to four-family residential mortgage loans are originated in amounts up to 80 of the lesser of the appraised value or purchase price of the property, although loans may be made with higher loan-to-value ratios. Private mortgage insurance is required to compensate for the risk. Fixed-rate loans are originated for terms of 10, 15, 20 and 30 years. At September 30, 2021, our largest loan secured by one- to four-family real estate had a principal balance of approximately 1.8 million and was secured by a single-family house. This loan was performing in accordance with its repayment terms. 
 We also offer adjustable-rate mortgage loans which have initial fixed terms of one, three, five or seven-years before converting to an annual adjustment schedule based on changes in a designated United States Treasury index. We originated 642,000 in adjustable rate one- to four-family residential loans during the year ended September 30, 2021 and did not originate any during the year ended September 30, 2020. Our adjustable rate mortgage loans provide for maximum rate adjustments of 200 basis points per adjustment, with a lifetime maximum adjustment of 500 basis points. Our adjustable rate mortgage loans amortize over terms of up to 30 years. 
 Adjustable rate mortgage loans decrease the risk associated with changes in market interest rates by periodically repricing but involve other risks. As interest rates increase, the principal and interest payments on the loan increase, thus increasing the potential for default by the borrower. At the same time, the marketability of the underlying collateral may be adversely affected by higher interest rates. Adjustment of the contractual interest rate is limited by the periodic and lifetime interest rate adjustments specified by our loan documents and therefore, is potentially limited in effectiveness during periods of rapidly rising interest rates. At September 30, 2021, 17.0 million, or 2.9 , of our one- to four-family residential loans had adjustable rates of interest. 
 5 
 
 All one- to four-family residential mortgage loans that we originate include a due-on-sale clause, which provides the right to declare a loan immediately due and payable in the event that the borrower sells or otherwise conveys title to the real property subject to the mortgage and the loan is not repaid. 
 Regulations limit the amount that a savings bank may lend relative to the value of the real estate securing the loan, as determined by an appraisal of the property at the time the loan is originated. For all purchase money loans, we utilize outside independent appraisers approved in accordance with the Bank s appraisal policy. All purchase money and most refinance loans require a lender s title insurance policy. Certain modest refinance requests may utilize an exterior inspection report and title search. We also require fire and casualty insurance and, where circumstances warrant, flood insurance. 
 Home Equity Loans and Lines of Credit. Home equity loans and lines of credit are generated by our loan originators. Eligible properties include primary and vacation homes located in Monroe, Northampton, Lackawanna, Luzerne, Lehigh, Chester, Delaware, and Montgomery Counties, Pennsylvania and secondarily in other Pennsylvania counties contiguous to our primary market area. As of September 30, 2021, home equity loans and lines of credit totaled about 38.4 million, or 2.8 of our loan portfolio. 
 The maximum combined loan-to-value originated is generally 80 although a maximum of 85 is permitted with more restrictive underwriting parameters depending on the collateral. There is a small portion of the portfolio originated in years past that contains original combined loan-to-values of up to 90 . Our home equity lines of credit typically feature a 10-year draw period with interest-only payments permitted, followed by another 20 years of fully amortizing payments with no further ability to draw funds. Similar combined loan-to-value characteristics and standards exist for the lines as are outlined above for the loans. 
 Loan underwriting standards limit the maximum size of a junior lien loan to between 100,000 and 500,000, depending on the loan type and collateral. All loans exceeding 75 of value require an appraisal by bank-approved, licensed appraisers. Loans up to 25,000 with lesser loan-to-value ratios may utilize an automated valuation model. Title/lien searches are secured on all home equity loans and lines. 
 Commercial Real Estate Loans. At September 30, 2021, 591.1 million, or 43.4 , of our total loan portfolio consisted of commercial real estate loans. Commercial real estate loans are secured by office and industrial buildings, multi-family, mixed-use properties and other commercial properties. We generally originate fixed rate commercial real estate loans with an initial term of five to seven years and a repricing option, and a maximum term of up to 25 years. The maximum loan-to-value ratio for most commercial real estate loans is 75 to 80 . At September 30, 2021, our largest commercial real estate relationship balance was 15.7 million, which was performing in accordance with its terms. 
 We consider a number of factors in originating commercial real estate loans. We evaluate the qualifications and financial condition of the borrower, including credit history, profitability and expertise, as well as the value and condition of the mortgaged property securing the loan. When evaluating the qualifications of the borrower, we consider the financial resources of the borrower, the borrower s experience in owning or managing similar property and the borrower s payment history with us and other financial institutions. In evaluating the property securing the loan, the factors we consider include the net operating income of the mortgaged property before debt service and depreciation, the ratio of the loan amount to the appraised value of the mortgaged property and the debt service coverage ratio (the ratio of net operating income to debt service) to ensure that it is at least 120 of the monthly debt service. All commercial real estate loans in excess of 500,000 are appraised by outside independent appraisers approved in accordance with the Bank s Appraisal Policy. Personal guarantees are obtained from commercial real estate borrowers although we may occasionally waive this requirement given very strong loan to value and debt service coverage ratios. All purchase money and most asset refinance borrowers are required to obtain title insurance. We also require fire and casualty insurance and, where circumstances warrant, flood insurance. 
 Loans secured by commercial real estate generally are considered to present greater risk than one- to four-family residential loans. Commercial real estate loans often involve large loan balances to single borrowers or groups of related borrowers. Repayment of these loans depends to a large degree on the results of operations and management of the properties securing the loans or the businesses conducted on such property and may be affected to a greater extent by adverse conditions in the real estate market or the economy in general. Accordingly, the nature of these loans makes them more difficult for management to monitor and evaluate. 
 First Mortgage Construction Loans. At September 30, 2021, 14.0 million, or 1.0 , of our total loan portfolio consisted of first mortgage construction loans. Our first mortgage construction loans are for the construction of residential properties. We currently offer fixed- and adjustable-rate residential first mortgage construction loans. First mortgage construction loans are generally structured for permanent mortgage financing once the construction is completed. At September 30, 2021, our largest first mortgage construction loan balance was 1.0 million. The loan was performing in accordance with its terms. First mortgage construction loans will generally be made in amounts of up to 80 of the appraised value of the completed property, or the actual cost of the improvements. First mortgage construction loans require only the payment of interest during the construction period. Once converted to permanent financing, they generally repay over a 30-year period. Funds are disbursed based on our inspections in accordance with a schedule reflecting the completion of portions of the project. 
 6 
 
 First mortgage construction loans generally involve a greater degree of credit risk than other one- to four-family residential mortgage loans. The risk of loss on a construction loan depends, in part, upon the accuracy of the initial estimate of the value of the property at completion of construction compared to the estimated cost of construction and the successful completion of construction within budget. 
 For all such loans, we utilize outside independent appraisers approved in accordance with the Bank s Appraisal Policy. All borrowers are required to obtain title insurance. We also require fire and casualty insurance and, where circumstances warrant, flood insurance on properties. 
 Commercial Loans. At September 30, 2021, 63.5 million, or 4.7 , of our loan portfolio, consisted of commercial loans. We generally offer commercial loans to businesses located in our primary market area. The commercial loan portfolio includes lines of credit, equipment loans, vehicle loans, improvement loans and term loans. These loans are primarily secured by vehicles, machinery and equipment, inventory, accounts receivable, marketable securities, deposit accounts and real estate. Commercial loans include approximately 22.6 million in PPP loans which provide relief to small businesses affected by the pandemic. 
 Obligations of States and Political Subdivisions. At September 30, 2021, 56.2 million, or 4.1 , of our total loan portfolio consisted of loan transactions including tax and revenue anticipation notes, general obligation notes, and authority general revenue notes. The financial strength of the state or political subdivision, type of transaction, relationship efforts, and profitability of return are considered when pricing and structuring each transaction. 
 Auto Loans. At September 30, 2021, 13.9 million, or 1.0 , of our total loan portfolio consisted of auto loans. Although collateralized, these loans require stringent underwriting standards and procedures. Each loan decision is based primarily on the credit history of the individual(s) and their ability to repay the loan. Collision and comprehensive insurance is required and the Bank must be listed as the loss payee. As previously disclosed, the Bank discontinued originating indirect auto loans in July 2018. 
 Indirect auto loans are inherently risky as they are often secured by assets that depreciate rapidly. In some cases, repossessed collateral for a defaulted automobile loan may not provide an adequate source of repayment for the outstanding loan and the remaining deficiency may not warrant further substantial collection efforts against the borrower. Automobile loan collections depend on the borrower s continuing financial stability, and therefore, are more likely to be adversely affected by job loss, divorce, illness, or personal bankruptcy. 
 Other Loans. We offer a variety of loans that are either unsecured or secured by property other than real estate. These loans include loans secured by deposits and personal unsecured loans. At September 30, 2021, these other loans totaled 1.6 million, or 0.2 , of the total loan portfolio. 
 Loan Approval Procedures and Authority. The loan approval process is intended to assess the borrower s ability to repay the loan, the viability of the loan, and the adequacy of the value of the property that will secure the loan. To assess the borrower s ability to repay, we review each borrower s employment and credit history and information on the historical and projected income and expenses of the borrower. For all loans the Board has established a lending authority policy. Larger and more complex loan requests require the involvement of senior management or the Board. 
 Non-Performing Loans and Problem Assets 
 Performance of the loan portfolio is reviewed on a regular basis by Bank management. A number of factors regarding the borrower, such as overall financial strength, collateral values and repayment ability, are considered in deciding what actions should be taken when determining the collectability of interest for accrual purposes. 
 When a loan, including a loan that is impaired, is classified as nonaccrual, the accrual of interest on such a loan is discontinued. A loan is typically classified as nonaccrual when the contractual payment of principal or interest has become 90 days past due or management has serious doubts about the further collectability of principal or interest, even though the loan is currently performing. A loan may remain on accrual status if it is in the process of collection and is either guaranteed or well secured. When a loan is placed on nonaccrual status, unpaid accrued interest is fully reversed. Interest payments received on nonaccrual loans are either applied against principal or reported as interest income, according to management s judgment as to the collectability of principal. 
 Loans are usually restored to accrual status when the obligation is brought current, has performed in accordance with the contractual terms for a reasonable period of time, and the ultimate collectability of the total contractual principal and interest is no longer in doubt.

 Non-performing Loans. At September 30, 2021 , 15.9 million, or 1 . 17 of our total loans, were non-performing loans. The majority of these loans were commercial real estate loans and residential mortgage loans. Non-performing commercia l real estate loans totaled 1 1.1 million at September 30, 2021 . Two loans account ed for 8.8 million of the total non-accrual commercial real estate loans. Non-performing r esidential first mortgage loans totaled 2.9 million at September 30, 2021 . 
 Real Estate Owned. At September 30, 2021, the Company had 461,000 of real estate owned consisting of eleven properties. These properties are being carried on the Company s books at fair value less estimated costs to sell. All these properties are being actively marketed and additional losses may occur.

For the years ended September 30, 2021, 2020 and 2019, gross interest income that would have been recorded had our non-accruing loans been current in accordance with their original terms was 182,000, 199,000 and 277,000 respectively. 
 At September 30, 2021, the principal balance of troubled debt restructurings TDRs was 9.7 million as compared to 2.7 million at September 30, 2020. All of the 9.7 million of TDRs at September 30, 2021 and 2.7 million at September 30, 2020 were non-accrual loans. 
 TDRs at September 30, 2021 were comprised of 11 residential loans totaling 1.2 million, seven commercial real estate loans totaling 8.4 million and four consumer loans (home equity loans, home equity lines of credit, auto and other) totaling 58,000. 
 For the year ended September 30, 2021, 13 loans totaling 1.0 million were removed from TDR status due to the completion of timely payments or paying off the balance. 
 We have modified terms of performing loans that do not meet the definition of a TDR. The vast majority of such loans were simply rate modifications of residential first mortgage loans in lieu of refinancing. The non-TDR rate modifications were all performing loans when the rates were reset to current market rates. For the year ended September 30, 2021, we modified 48 loans totaling 8.5 million that did not constitute troubled debt restructures. With regard to commercial loans, including commercial real estate loans, various non-troubled loans were modified, either for the purpose of a rate reduction to reflect current market rates (in lieu of a refinance) or the extension of a loan s maturity date. In total we modified 22 commercial loans with an aggregate balance of approximately 30.3 million for the year ended September 30, 2021 that did not constitute troubled debt restructures. The Company has also granted pandemic-related forbearance for loans that are not defined as a TDR. Loans still in forbearance at September 30, 2021 included 30.6 million in commercial real estate, 374,000 in commercial and 140,000 in one-to four-family.

Classified Assets. Banking regulations and our Asset Classification Policy provide that loans and other assets considered to be of lesser quality should be classified as Substandard, Doubtful or Loss assets. An asset is considered Substandard if it is inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. Substandard assets include those characterized by the distinct possibility that the institution will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. Assets classified as Doubtful have all of the weaknesses inherent in those classified Substandard, with the added characteristic that the weaknesses present make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, highly questionable and improbable. Assets classified as Loss are those considered uncollectible and of such little value that their continuance as assets without the establishment of a specific loss reserve is not warranted. We classify an asset as Special Mention if the asset has a potential weakness that warrants management s close attention. While such assets are not impaired, management has concluded that if the potential weakness in the asset is not addressed, the value of the asset may deteriorate, thereby adversely affecting the repayment of the asset. 
 At September 30, 2021, the Company classified approximately 20.6 million of our assets as Special Mention, of which 20.3 million were commercial and commercial real estate loans, and 26.5 million as Substandard, of which 23.3 million were commercial and commercial real estate loans. No loans were classified Doubtful or Loss. At September 30, 2020, we classified approximately 15.7 million of our assets as Special Mention, of which 15.0 million were commercial and commercial real estate loans, and 17.3 million as Substandard, of which 16.9 million were commercial and commercial real estate loans. No loans were classified as Doubtful or Loss. 
 The loan portfolio is reviewed on a regular basis to determine whether any loans require classification in accordance with applicable regulations. Not all classified assets constitute non-performing assets. 
 10 
 
 Allowance for Loan Losses 
 Our allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level necessary to absorb loan losses that are both probable and reasonably estimable. Management, in determining the allowance for loan losses, considers the losses inherent in its loan portfolio and changes in the nature and volume of loan activities, along with the general economic and real estate market conditions. Our allowance for loan losses consists of two elements: (1) an allocated allowance, which comprises allowances established on specific loans and class allowances based on historical loss experience and current trends, and (2) an unallocated allowance based on general economic conditions and other risk factors in our markets and portfolios. We maintain a loan review system, which allows for a periodic review (at least quarterly) of our loan portfolio and the early identification of potential impaired loans. Such system takes into consideration, among other things, delinquency status, size of loans, type and market value of collateral and financial condition of the borrowers. Specific loan loss allowances are established for identified losses based on a review of such information. A loan evaluated for impairment is considered to be impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. All loans identified as impaired are evaluated independently. We do not aggregate such loans for evaluation purposes. Loan impairment is measured based on the fair value of collateral method, taking into account the appraised value, any valuation assumptions used, estimated costs to sell and trends in the market since the appraisal date. General loan loss allowances are based upon a combination of factors including, but not limited to, actual loan loss experience, composition of the loan portfolio, current economic conditions, management s judgment and losses which are probable and reasonably estimable. In addition, for the twelve months ended September 30, 2021, consideration was given and a credit provision was recorded for loans granted short term payment relief. The allowance is increased through provisions charged against current earnings and recoveries of previously charged-off loans. Loans that are determined to be uncollectible are charged against the allowance. While management uses available information to recognize probable and reasonably estimable loan losses, future loss provisions may be necessary based on changing economic conditions. Payments received on impaired loans generally are either applied against principal or reported as interest income, according to management s judgment as to the collectability of principal. The allowance for loan losses as of September 30, 2021 is maintained at a level that represents management s best estimate of losses inherent in the loan portfolio, and such losses were both probable and reasonably estimable. 
 In addition, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the Federal Reserve Board ), the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation FDIC and the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review our allowance for loan losses. The banking regulators may require that we recognize additions to the allowance based on their analysis and review of information available to them at the time of their examination.

We use the accrual method of accounting for all performing loans. The accrual of interest income is generally discontinued when the contractual payment of principal or interest has become 90 days past due or management has serious doubts about further collectability of principal or interest, even though the loan is currently performing. When a loan is placed on nonaccrual status, unpaid interest previously credited to income is reversed. Interest received on nonaccrual loans is either applied against principal or reported as interest income, according to managements judgement as to the collectability of principal. Generally, residential and consumer loans are restored to accrual status when the obligation is brought current in accordance with the contractual terms for a reasonable period of time and ultimate collectability of total contractual principal and interest is no longer in doubt. Commercial loans are restored to accrual status when the obligation is brought current, has performed in accordance with the contractual terms for a reasonable period of time and ultimate collectability of total contractual principal and interest no longer is in doubt. 
 In our collection efforts, we will first attempt to cure any delinquent loan. If a real estate secured loan is placed on nonaccrual status, it could be subject to transfer to the real estate owned REO portfolio (comprised of properties acquired by or in lieu of foreclosure), upon which our credit administration department will pursue the sale of the real estate. Prior to this transfer, the loan balance will be reduced, if necessary, to reflect its current market value less estimated costs to sell. Write downs of REO that occur after the initial transfer from the loan portfolio and costs of holding the property are recorded as other operating expenses, except for significant improvements which are capitalized to the extent that the carrying value does not exceed estimated net realizable value. 
 Fair values for determining the value of collateral are estimated from various sources, such as real estate appraisals, financial statements and from any other reliable sources of available information. For those loans deemed to be impaired, collateral value is reduced for the estimated costs to sell. Reductions of collateral value are based on historical loss experience, current market data, and any other source of reliable information specific to the collateral. 
 This analysis process is inherently subjective, as it requires us to make estimates that are susceptible to revisions as more information becomes available. Although we believe that we have established the allowance at levels to absorb probable and estimable losses, future additions may be necessary if economic or other conditions in the future differ from the current environment.

 Securities Activities 
 Our securities investment policy is established by our Board of Directors. This policy dictates that investment decisions be made based on the safety of the investment, liquidity requirements, potential returns, cash flow targets, and consistency with our interest rate risk management strategy. Our investment policy is reviewed annually by our ALCO/Investment Management Committee. All policy changes recommended by this management committee must be approved by the Board of Directors. The Committee is comprised of the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Controller, Chief Operating Officer, Chief Banking Officer, Administration/Operations Division Manager, Director of Consumer Lending, Chief Risk Officer. Authority to make investments under the approved guidelines is delegated by the Committee to appropriate officers. While general investment strategies are developed and authorized by the ALCO / Investment Management Committee, the execution of specific actions rests with the Chief Financial Officer. 
 The approved investment officers are authorized to execute investment transactions up to 5.0 million per transaction without the prior approval of the ALCO / Investment Management Committee and within the scope of the established investment policy. These officers are also authorized to execute investment transactions between 5.0 million and 10.0 million with the additional approval from the Chief Executive Officer. Each transaction in excess of 10.0 million must receive prior approval of the ALCO/Investment Management Committee. 
 Our current investment policy generally permits investments in debt securities issued by the U.S. government and U.S. agencies, obligations of states and political subdivisions, and corporate debt obligations, as well as investments in the Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh (federal agency securities) and, to a much lesser extent, other equity securities. Securities in these categories are classified as investment securities for financial reporting purposes. The policy also permits investments in mortgage-backed securities, including pass-through securities issued and guaranteed by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Government National Mortgage Association GNMA as well as commercial paper. Our current investment strategy uses a risk management approach of diversified investing in fixed-rate securities with short- to intermediate-term maturities, as well as adjustable-rate securities, which may have a longer term to maturity. The emphasis of this approach is to increase overall investment securities yields while managing interest rate risk. 
 Our policy is that, at the time of purchase, we designate a security as held to maturity, available-for-sale, or trading, depending on our ability and intent. Securities that are available-for-sale or held for trading are reported at fair value, while securities held to maturity are reported at amortized cost. 
 FHLB Securities. We hold Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh FHLB-Pittsburgh common stock to qualify for membership in the Federal Home Loan Bank System and to be eligible to borrow funds under the FHLB advance program. There is no market for the common stock. 
 The aggregate fair value of our FHLB-Pittsburgh common stock as of September 30, 2021 was 4.5 million based on its par value. No unrealized gains or losses have been recorded because we have determined that the par value of the common stock represents its fair value. We owned shares of FHLB-Pittsburgh common stock at September 30, 2021 with a par value that was equal to what we were required to own to maintain our membership in the Federal Home Loan Bank System and to be eligible to obtain advances. We are required to purchase additional stock as our outstanding advances increase. Any excess stock we own is redeemed weekly by the FHLB-Pittsburgh. 
 Evaluation of Securities Portfolio. We review debt securities with significant declines in fair value on a periodic basis to determine whether they should be considered temporarily or other than temporarily impaired. If a decline in the fair value of a security is determined to be other than temporary, we are required to reduce the carrying value of the security to its fair value and record a non-cash, credit related impairment charge in the amount of the decline, net of tax effect, against our current income. 
 Our investment securities portfolio contains unrealized losses on securities, including mortgage-related instruments issued or backed by the full faith and credit of the United States government, or generally viewed as having the implied guarantee of the United States government, and debt obligations of a state or political subdivision, corporate obligations, and other debt securities. 
 14 
 
 Our policy is to recognize an other -than-temporary impairment of equity securities where the fair value has been significantly below cost for four consecutive quarters. For fixed maturity investments with unrealized losses due to interest rates where the Company does not intend to sell the security and it is more likely than not that the Company will not be required to sell the security before its anticipated recovery in market value, declines in value below cost are not assumed to be other than temporary. We review our position quarterly and concluded that at September 30, 2021 , declines included in the table below represent temporary declines due to interest rate change, and we do not intend to sell those securities and it is more likely than not that we will not have to sell those securities before their anticipated recovery in market value. 
 The following table sets forth the composition of our securities portfolio (excluding FHLB-Pittsburgh common stock) at the dates indicated.

Sources of Funds 
 General. Deposits, borrowings, repayments and prepayments of loans and securities, proceeds from maturing securities and cash flows from operations are the primary sources of our funds for use in lending, investing and for other general purposes. 
 Deposits. We offer a variety of deposit accounts with a range of interest rates and terms. Our deposit accounts consist of savings accounts, interest bearing demand accounts, checking accounts, money market accounts, club accounts, certificates of deposit and IRAs and other qualified plan accounts. We provide commercial checking accounts for businesses. 
 At September 30, 2021, our deposits totaled 1.6 billion. Interest-bearing demand, savings and club, and money market deposits totaled 1.4 billion at September 30, 2021. At September 30, 2021, we had a total of 209.9 million in certificates of deposit. Noninterest-bearing demand deposits totaled 257.7 million. Although we have a significant portion of our deposits in shorter-term certificates of deposit, we monitor activity on these accounts and, based on historical experience and our current pricing strategy, we believe we will retain a large portion of these accounts upon maturity. 
 Our deposits are obtained predominantly from the areas in which our branch offices are located. We rely on our favorable locations, customer service and competitive pricing to attract and retain these deposits. While we accept certificates of deposit in excess of 100,000 for which we may provide preferential rates, we generally do not solicit such deposits as they are more difficult to retain than core deposits. At September 30, 2021, we had a total of 225.0 million of brokered certificates of deposits, an increase of 6.8 million from the prior fiscal year end. Our brokered certificates of deposits range from less than one- to three-year terms and are purchased only through pre-approved brokers. 
 The following table sets forth the distribution of average deposit accounts, by account type, at the dates indicated.

 Competition 
 We face significant competition in both originating loans and attracting deposits. The counties in which we operate have a significant concentration of financial institutions, many of which are significantly larger institutions and have greater financial resources, and many of which are our competitors to varying degrees. Our competition for loans comes principally from commercial banks, savings banks, mortgage banking companies, credit unions, leasing companies, insurance companies and other financial service companies. Our most direct competition for deposits has historically come from commercial banks, savings banks and credit unions. We face additional competition for deposits from nondepository competitors such as the mutual fund industry, securities and brokerage firms and insurance companies. 
 We seek to meet this competition by the convenience of our branch locations, emphasizing personalized banking, electronic banking solutions and the advantage of local decision-making in our banking business. Specifically, we promote and maintain relationships and build customer loyalty within local communities by focusing our marketing and community involvement on the specific needs of individual neighborhoods. As of September 30, 2021, the Bank had the largest deposit market share in Monroe County, Pennsylvania. We do not rely on any individual, group, or entity for a material portion of our deposits. 
 Employees and Human Capital Resources 
 As of September 30, 2021, we had 234 full-time employees, and 17 part-time employees. The employees are not represented by a collective bargaining unit and we consider our relationship with our employees to be good. 
 
 We encourage and support the growth and development of our employees and, wherever possible, seek to fill positions by promotion and transfer from within the organization. Continual learning and career development is advanced through ongoing performance and development conversations with employees, internally developed training programs, customized corporate training engagements and educational reimbursement programs. Reimbursement is available to employees enrolled in pre-approved degree or certification programs at accredited institutions that teach skills or knowledge relevant to our business, in compliance with Section 127 of the Internal Revenue Code, and for seminars, conferences, and other training events employees attend in connection with their job duties. 
 
 The safety, health and wellness of our employees is a top priority. The COVID-19 pandemic continues to present a unique challenge with regard to maintaining employee safety while continuing successful operations. Through teamwork and the adaptability of our management and staff, we have been able to transition, many of our employees to working from remote locations and ensure a safely-distanced working environment for employees performing customer facing activities at branches and operations centers. All employees are asked not to come to work when they experience signs or symptoms of a possible COVID-19 illness and have been provided additional paid time off to cover compensation during such absences. On an ongoing basis, we further promote the health and wellness of our employees by strongly encouraging work-life balance, offering flexible work schedules, keeping the employee portion of health care premiums to a minimum and sponsoring various wellness programs. 
 
 Employee retention helps us operate efficiently and achieve one of our business objectives, which is being a low-cost provider. We believe our commitment to living out our core values, actively prioritizing concern for our employees well-being, supporting our employees career goals, offering competitive wages and providing valuable fringe benefits aids in retention of our top-performing employees. In addition, nearly all of our employees are stockholders of the Company through participation in our 
 18 

employee stock ownership plan, which aligns associate and stockholder interests by providing stock ownership on a tax-deferred basis at no investment cost to our associates. 
 Subsidiary Activities 
 The Bank has four wholly owned subsidiaries, ESSACOR, Inc., Pocono Investment Company, ESSA Advisory Services, LLC, and Integrated Financial Corporation and its fully owned subsidiary Integrated Abstract Incorporated. ESSACOR, Inc. is a Pennsylvania corporation that has been used to purchase properties at tax sales that represent collateral for delinquent loans of the Bank and is currently inactive. Pocono Investment Company is a Delaware corporation formed as an investment company subsidiary to hold and manage certain investments of the Bank, including certain intellectual property. ESSA Advisory Services, LLC is a Pennsylvania limited liability company owned by the Bank. ESSA Advisory Services, LLC is Pennsylvania limited liability company that is a full-service insurance benefits consulting company offering group services such as health insurance, life insurance, short term and long term disability, dental, vision and 401(K) retirement planning as well as individual health products. Integrated Financial Corporation is a Pennsylvania corporation that provided investment advisory services to the general public and is currently inactive. Integrated Abstract Incorporated is a Pennsylvania corporation that provided title insurance services and is currently inactive. 
 SUPERVISION AND REGULATION 
 General 
 The Company is a Pennsylvania corporation. The Company was formerly regulated as a savings and loan holding company, and in November 2014 took the steps necessary to be regulated as a bank holding company. As a bank holding company, we are required to file certain reports with, and otherwise comply with the rules and regulations of the Federal Reserve Board. 
 The Bank is a Pennsylvania-chartered savings bank and its deposit accounts are insured up to applicable limits by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation FDIC under the Deposit Insurance Fund DIF ). We are subject to extensive regulation by the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities (the Department ), our chartering agency, and by the FDIC, our primary federal regulator. We must file reports with the Department and the FDIC concerning our activities and financial condition, in addition to obtaining regulatory approvals prior to entering into certain transactions including, but not limited to, mergers with or acquisitions of other savings institutions. There are periodic examinations by the Department and the FDIC to test our compliance with various regulatory requirements. This regulation and supervision establishes a comprehensive framework of activities in which an institution can engage and is intended primarily for the protection of the FDIC insurance fund and depositors. The regulatory structure also gives the regulatory authorities extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities and with their examination policies, including policies with respect to the classification of assets and the establishment of adequate loan loss reserves for regulatory purposes. Any change in such regulation, whether by the Department or the FDIC could have a material adverse impact on us and our operations. 
 Regulation by the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities 
 The Pennsylvania Banking Code of 1965, as amended (the Banking Code contains detailed provisions governing the organization, location of offices, rights and responsibilities of directors, officers, employees, and depositors, as well as corporate powers, savings and investment operations and other aspects of the Bank and its affairs. The Banking Code delegates extensive rulemaking power and administrative discretion to the Department so that the supervision and regulation of state-chartered savings banks may be flexible and readily responsive to changes in economic conditions and in savings and lending practices. The Department may also take enforcement actions against savings banks and may appoint a receiver or conservator for a savings bank under certain circumstances. 
 The Department generally examines each savings bank not less frequently than once every two years. Although the Department may accept the examinations and reports of the FDIC in lieu of the Department s examination, the current practice is for the Department to conduct individual examinations. The Department may order any savings bank to discontinue any violation of law or unsafe or unsound business practice and may direct any trustee, officer, attorney, or employee of a savings bank engaged in an objectionable activity, after the Department has ordered the activity to be terminated, to show cause at a hearing before the Department why such person should not be removed. 
 The Bank was formerly a Pennsylvania savings association. Changes to Pennsylvania law repealed the Savings Association Code. Consequently, in March 2014, the Bank converted its charter to a Pennsylvania savings bank whose state law powers are primarily governed by Chapter 5 of the Pennsylvania Baking Code of 1965, as amended. The charter conversion did not have a material effect on the operations of the Bank. 
 19 

Regulation by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation 
 The Bank is also subject to extensive regulation, examination and supervision by the FDIC, as its primary federal regulator. Such regulation and supervision: 

limits the investment authority of the Bank 

establishes a continuing and affirmative obligation, consistent with the Bank s safe and sound operation, to help meet the credit needs of its community, including low and moderate income neighborhoods 

establishes various capital categories resulting in various levels of regulatory scrutiny applied to the institutions in a particular category and 

establishes standards for safety and soundness. 

 The FDIC is required by law to examine each regulated institution every twelve months, subject to an exception for institutions of less than 3 billion of total assets that satisfy certain other criteria, which are on an eighteen-month examination schedule. The FDIC has the authority to order any savings bank and its directors, officers, attorneys or employees to discontinue any violation of law or unsafe or unsound banking practice. 
 Federal law and FDIC regulations generally limit the activities as principal and investments of state-chartered FDIC insured banks and their subsidiaries to those permissible for national banks and their subsidiaries, unless such activities and investments are specifically exempted by law or consented to by the FDIC. 
 Before engaging in a new activity as principal that is not permissible for a national bank or otherwise permissible under federal law or FDIC regulations, an insured savings bank must seek approval from the FDIC to engage in such activity. The FDIC will not approve the activity unless the savings bank meets its minimum capital requirements and the FDIC determines that the activity does not present a significant risk to the FDIC insurance funds. Certain activities of subsidiaries that are engaged in activities permitted for national banks only through a financial subsidiary are subject to additional restrictions. Although the Bank meets all conditions necessary to establish and engage in permitted activities through financial subsidiaries, it has not chosen to engage in such activities. 
 Transactions with Affiliates 
 Transactions between an insured bank, such as the Bank, and any of its affiliates are governed by Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and implementing regulations. An affiliate of a bank is any company or entity that controls, is controlled by or is under common control with the bank. Generally, a subsidiary of a bank that is not also a depository institution or financial subsidiary is not treated as an affiliate of the bank under Sections 23A and 23B but instead is considered part of the bank for purposes of the applicable limits and requirements. 
 Section 23A: 

limits the extent to which a bank and its subsidiaries may engage in covered transactions with any one affiliate to an amount equal to 10 of such bank s capital stock and retained earnings, and limits all such transactions with all affiliates to an amount equal to 20 of such capital stock and retained earnings and 

requires that all such transactions be on terms that are consistent with safe and sound banking practices. 

 The term covered transaction includes the making of loans, purchase of assets, issuance of guarantees and similar transactions. Most loans by a bank to any of its affiliates must be secured by collateral in amounts ranging from 100 to 130 of the loan amounts, depending on the type of collateral. In addition, any covered transaction by a bank with an affiliate and any purchase of assets or services by a bank from an affiliate must be on terms that are substantially the same, or at least as favorable to the bank, as those that would be provided to a non-affiliate 
 Insurance of Accounts and Regulation by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation 
 Deposit accounts in the Bank are insured by the FDIC s Deposit Insurance Fund DIF generally up to a maximum of 250,000 per separately insured depositor and up to a maximum of 250,000 for self-directed retirement accounts. 
 The FDIC charges insured depository institutions risk-based assessments to maintain the DIF. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the Dodd-Frank Act required the FDIC to revise its procedures to base its assessments upon each insured institution s total assets less tangible equity instead of deposits. The FDIC finalized a rule, effective 
 20 

April 1, 2011, that set the assessment range at 2.5 to 45 basis points of total assets less tangible equity. Effective July 1, 2016, the FDIC adopted changes that eliminated its prior practice of placing insured institutions into risk categories. Instead, assessments for most banks are now based on financial measures and supervisory ratings derived from statistical modeling estimating the probability of failure over three years. In conjunction with the DIF reserve ratio achieving 1. 1 5 , the assessment range (inclusive of possible adjustments) was also reduced for most banks to 1.5 basis points to 30 basis points. Beginning September 2019, banks of less than 10 billion of total assets received certain small bank assessment credits for the portion of their assessments that contributed to the growth of the FDIC s fund reserve ratio from 1.15 to 1.35 . The credits ended as of the September 30, 2021 assessment invoice. 
 
 The FDIC may adjust its risk-based assessment system in the future, except that no adjustment can be made without notice and comment rulemaking. No institution may pay a dividend if in default of the federal deposit insurance assessment. 
 
 Insurance of deposits may be terminated by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation upon a finding that an institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. The Bank does not believe that it is taking or is subject to any action, condition or violation that could lead to termination of its deposit insurance. 
 Capital Requirements 
 Federal regulations require FDIC insured depository institutions to meet several minimum capital standards: a common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets ratio, a Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets ratio, a total capital to risk-based assets, and a Tier 1 capital to total adjusted assets leverage ratio. The existing capital requirements were effective January 1, 2015 and are the result of a final rule implementing regulatory amendments based on recommendations of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and certain requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act. 
 The capital standards require the maintenance of common equity Tier 1 capital, Tier 1 capital and total capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 4.5 , 6 and 8 , respectively, and a leverage ratio of at least 4 Tier 1 capital. Common equity Tier 1 capital is generally defined as common stockholders equity and retained earnings. Tier 1 capital is generally defined as common equity Tier 1 and additional Tier 1 capital. Additional Tier 1 capital includes certain noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and related surplus and minority interests in equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries. Total capital includes Tier 1 capital (common equity Tier 1 capital plus additional Tier 1 capital) and Tier 2 capital. Tier 2 capital is comprised of capital instruments and related surplus, meeting specified requirements, and may include cumulative preferred stock and long-term perpetual preferred stock, mandatory convertible securities, intermediate preferred stock and subordinated debt. Also included in Tier 2 capital is the allowance for loan and lease losses limited to a maximum of 1.25 of risk-weighted assets and, for institutions that have exercised an opt-out election regarding the treatment of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income AOCI ), up to 45 of net unrealized gains on available-for-sale equity securities with readily determinable fair market values. Institutions that have not exercised the AOCI opt-out have AOCI incorporated into common equity Tier 1 capital (including unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale-securities). The Bank elected to opt out of this requirement. Calculation of all types of regulatory capital is subject to deductions and adjustments specified in the regulations. 
 In determining the amount of risk-weighted assets for purposes of calculating risk-based capital ratios, all assets, including certain off-balance sheet assets (e.g., recourse obligations, direct credit substitutes, residual interests) are multiplied by a risk weight factor assigned by the regulations based on the risks believed inherent in the type of asset. Higher levels of capital are required for asset categories believed to present greater risk. For example, a risk weight of 0 is assigned to cash and U.S. government securities, a risk weight of 50 is generally assigned to prudently underwritten first lien one- to four- family residential mortgages, a risk weight of 100 is assigned to commercial and consumer loans, a risk weight of 150 is assigned to certain past due loans and a risk weight of between 0 to 600 is assigned to permissible equity interests, depending on certain specified factors. 
 In addition to establishing the minimum regulatory capital requirements capital, the regulations limit capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments to management if the institution does not hold a capital conservation buffer consisting of 2.5 of common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted asset above the amount necessary to meet its minimum risk-based capital requirements. A bank s failure to achieve the capital conservation buffer will result in restrictions on paying dividends, engaging in stock repurchases and paying discretionary bonuses. The capital conservation buffer requirement was phased in. It began on January 1, 2016 at 0.625 of risk-weighted assets and has increased on January 1 of each succeeding year by 0.625 . It was fully implemented at 2.5 on January 1, 2019. 
 Legislation enacted in May 2018 required the federal banking agencies, including the FDIC, to establish an optional community bank leverage ratio of between 8 to 10 Tier 1 equity/consolidated assets. That alternative is available to institutions with assets of less than 10 billion of assets that meet certain other requirements (including off-balance sheet exposure of 25 or less

of total assets and trading assets and liabilities of 5 or less of total assets) . Eligible i nstitutions with a capital level meeting or exceeding the specified requirement and electing to use the community bank leverage ratio framework are considered to comply with the applicable regulatory capital requirements, including the risk-based requirements. The establishment of the community bank leverage ratio was subject to notice and comment rulemaking by the federal regulators and a final rule was issued in November 2019 establishing the community bank leverage ratio at 9 . The community bank leverage ratio option was available commencing the first quarter of 2020 . A qualifying institution may opt in and out of the community bank leverage ratio framework on its quarterly call report. An institution that ceases to meet any qualifying criteria is provided with a two-quarter grace period to either comply with the community bank leverage ratio requirements or comply with the general capital regulations, including the risk-based capital requirements. 
 Section 4012 of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act of 2020 required that the community bank leverage ratio be temporarily lowered to 8 . The federal regulators issued a rule implementing the lower ratio effective April 23, 2020. The rule also established a two-quarter grace period for a qualifying institution whose leverage ratio falls below the 8 community bank leverage ratio requirement so long as the bank maintains a leverage ratio of 7 or greater. Another rule was issued to transition back to the 9 community bank leverage ratio by increasing the ratio to 8.5 for calendar year 2021 and 9 thereafter. 
 In assessing an institution s capital adequacy, the FDIC takes into consideration, not only these numeric factors, but qualitative factors as well, and has the authority to establish higher capital requirements for individual institutions where deemed necessary. 
 At September 30, 2021, the Bank s capital exceeded all applicable requirements. 
 Any state-chartered savings bank that fails any of the capital requirements is subject to possible enforcement actions by the FDIC. Such actions could include a capital directive, a cease and desist order, civil money penalties, the establishment of restrictions on an institution s operations, termination of federal deposit insurance and the appointment of a conservator or receiver. Certain corrective actions are required by law, as described further under Prompt Corrective Action. 
 We are also subject to capital regulations of the Department which generally incorporate federal leverage and risk-based capital requirements. 
 Dividends from ESSA Bank & Trust 
 Our ability to pay dividends depends, to a large extent, upon the Bank s ability to pay dividends to the Company. The Banking Code states that no dividend may be paid out of surplus without approval of the Department. Dividends may be paid out of accumulated net earnings. No dividend may generally be paid that would result in the Bank failing to comply with its regulatory capital requirements. 
 Prompt Corrective Action 
 Under the federal Prompt Corrective Action regulations, a savings bank is deemed to be (i) well capitalized if it has total risk-based capital of 10.0 or more, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8.0 or more, a Tier I leverage capital ratio of 5.0 or more, a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 6.5 or more and is not subject to any written capital order or directive (ii) adequately capitalized if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of 8.0 or more, a Tier I risk-based capital ratio of 6.0 or more, a Tier I leverage capital ratio of 4.0 or more, a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 4.5 or more, and does not meet the definition of well capitalized (iii) undercapitalized if it has a total risk-based capital ratio that is less than 8.0 , a Tier I risk-based capital ratio that is less than 6.0 , a Tier I leverage capital ratio that is less than 4.0 or a common equity Tier 1 leverage ratio of less than 4.5 , (iv) significantly undercapitalized if it has a total risk-based capital ratio that is less than 6.0 , a Tier I risk-based capital ratio that is less than 4.0 , a Tier I leverage capital ratio that is less than 3.0 or a common equity Tier 1 ratio of less than 3 and (v) critically undercapitalized if it has a ratio of tangible equity to total assets that is equal to or less than 2.0 . Federal regulations also specify circumstances under which a federal banking agency may reclassify a well capitalized institution as adequately capitalized and may require an adequately capitalized institution to comply with supervisory actions as if it were in the next lower category (except that the FDIC may not reclassify a significantly undercapitalized institution as critically undercapitalized). 
 22 

Generally, the FDIC is required to appoint a receiver or conservator within specific time frames for a savings bank that becomes critically undercapitalized. The regulations also provide that a capital restoration plan must be filed with the FDIC within 45 days of the date a savings bank receives notice that it is undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized or critically undercapitalized . The holding company for a savings bank required to submit a capital restoration plan must guarantee the lesser of: an amount equal to 5 of a savings bank s assets at the time it was notified or deemed to be undercapitalized by the FDIC, or the amount necessary to restore the savings bank to adequately capitalized status. The guarantee remains in place until the FDIC notifies the savings bank that it has maintained adequately capitalized status for each of four consecutive calendar quarters. Undercapitalized institutions are subject to certain mandatory restrictions, including on capital distributions and growth. Significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized institutions are subject to additional restrictions. The FDIC may also take any one of a number of discretionary supervisory actions against an undercapitalized savings bank, including the issuance of a capital directive and the replacement of senior executive officers and directors. 
 The Prompt Corrective categories discussed above were effective January 1, 2015 and reflect the revised regulatory capital requirements effective the same date. The final rule establishing the community bank leverage ratio provides that an institution electing and complying with that alternative regulatory capital framework is considered to be well capitalized under the Prompt Corrective Actions regulations. 
 As of September 30, 2021, the Bank was a well-capitalized institution under the Prompt Corrective Action regulations.

The USA PATRIOT Act 
 The USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 gave the federal government powers to address terrorist threats through enhanced domestic security measures, expanded surveillance powers, increased information sharing and broadened anti-money laundering requirements. The USA PATRIOT Act also required the federal banking agencies to take into consideration the effectiveness of controls designed to combat money laundering activities in determining whether to approve a merger or other acquisition application of a member institution. Accordingly, if we engage in a merger or other acquisition, our controls designed to combat money laundering would be considered as part of the application process. We have established policies, procedures and systems designed to comply with these regulations. 
 Holding Company Regulation 
 The Company is a bank holding company that has elected to be a financial holding company and is subject to examination, regulation and periodic reporting under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 (the Bank Holding Company Act ), as administered by the Federal Reserve Board. The Federal Reserve Board has adopted capital adequacy regulations for bank holding companies on a consolidated basis. The Dodd-Frank Act required the Federal Reserve Board to promulgate consolidated capital requirements for depository institution holding companies that are no less stringent, both quantitatively and in terms of components of capital, than those applicable to institutions themselves. Consolidated regulatory capital requirements identical to those applicable to the subsidiary institutions applied to bank holding companies with greater than 1 billion in assets, including the Company, effective January 1, 2015. However, federal legislation enacted in May 2018 and implemented by the Federal Reserve Board effective August 30, 2018, raised the threshold of the Federal Reserve Board s Small Bank Holding Company exception to the application of consolidated capital requirements from 1 billion to 3 billion of consolidated assets. Consequently, bank holding companies of under 3 billion of consolidated assets are no longer subject to the consolidated requirements unless otherwise directed by the Federal Reserve Board. 
 Regulations of the Federal Reserve Board provide that a bank holding company must serve as a source of strength to any of its subsidiary banks and must not conduct its activities in an unsafe or unsound manner. The Dodd-Frank Act codified the source of strength policy and required the issuance of implementing regulations. Under the prompt corrective action provisions of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, a bank holding company parent of an undercapitalized subsidiary bank must guarantee, within limitations, the capital restoration plan that is required of an undercapitalized bank. If an undercapitalized bank fails to file an acceptable capital restoration plan or to implement an accepted plan, the Federal Reserve Board may prohibit the bank holding company parent of the undercapitalized bank from paying any dividend or making any other form of capital distribution. In addition, Federal Reserve Board policy is that a bank holding company should pay cash dividends only to the extent that the company s net income for the past year is consistent with the company s capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. 
 A bank holding company is required to give the Federal Reserve Board prior written notice of any purchase or redemption of its outstanding equity securities if the gross consideration for the purchase or redemption, when combined with the net consideration paid for all such purchases or redemptions during the preceding 12 months, will equal 10 or more of the company s consolidated net worth. The Federal Reserve Board may disapprove such a purchase or redemption if it determines that the proposal would constitute an unsafe and unsound practice, or would violate any law, regulation, Federal Reserve Board order or directive, or any condition imposed by, or written agreement with, the Federal Reserve Board. Such notice and approval is not required for a bank holding company that is well capitalized under applicable regulations of the Federal Reserve Board, has received at least an overall satisfactory composite rating, as well as satisfactory rating for management, at its most recent bank holding company examination by the Federal Reserve Board, and that is not the subject of any unresolved supervisory issues. In addition, Federal Reserve Board guidance provides for agency prior review of bank holding company dividends and stock redemptions and repurchases in certain circumstances, which may affect our ability to pay dividends, or engage in redemptions or repurchases. 
 As a financial holding company, we are permitted (1) to engage in other activities that the Federal Reserve Board determines to be financial in nature, incidental to an activity that is financial in nature, or complementary to a financial activity and that do not pose a substantial risk to the safety and soundness of depository institutions or the financial system generally, or (2) to acquire shares of companies engaged in such activities. We may not, however, directly or indirectly acquire the ownership or control of more than 5 of any class of voting shares, or substantially all of the assets, of a bank holding company or a bank without the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board. 
 In order to maintain our status as a financial holding company, we must remain well capitalized and well managed under applicable regulations and maintain a satisfactory or better rating under the Community Reinvestment Act. Failure to meet one or more of the requirements would mean, depending on the requirements not met, that we could not undertake new activities, make acquisitions other than those permitted generally for bank holding companies, or continue certain activities.

Regulatory Enforcement Authority 
 Federal law provides federal banking regulators with substantial enforcement powers. This enforcement authority includes, among other things, the ability to assess civil money penalties, issue cease-and-desist and removal orders, and initiate injunctive actions against banking organizations and institution-affiliated parties, as defined. In general, these enforcement actions may be initiated for violations of laws and regulations and unsafe or unsound practices. Other actions or inactions may provide the basis for enforcement action, including misleading or untimely reports filed with regulatory authorities. 
 Federal Securities Laws 
 Shares of the Company s common stock are registered with the SEC under Section 12(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ). The Company is also subject to the proxy rules, tender offer rules, insider trading restrictions, annual and periodic reporting, and other requirements of the Exchange Act. 
 Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 
 The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 was enacted in response to public concerns regarding corporate accountability in connection with certain accounting scandals. The stated goals of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act are to increase corporate responsibility, to provide for enhanced penalties for accounting and auditing improprieties at publicly traded companies, and to protect investors by improving the accuracy and reliability of corporate disclosures pursuant to the securities laws. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act generally applies to all companies that file or are required to file periodic reports with the SEC, under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. 
 The Sarbanes-Oxley Act includes specific additional disclosure requirements, requires the Securities and Exchange Commission and national securities exchanges to adopt extensive additional disclosure, corporate governance and other related rules, and mandates further studies of certain issues by the SEC. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act represents significant federal involvement in matters traditionally left to state regulatory systems, such as the regulation of the accounting profession, and to corporate law, such as the relationship between a board of directors and management and between a board of directors and its committees. 
 Although we have and will continue to incur additional expense in complying with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the resulting regulations, management does not expect that such compliance will have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition. 
 The Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (the CARES Act 
 The CARES Act, which became law on March 27, 2020, provided over 2 trillion to combat the coronavirus (COVID-19) and stimulate the economy. The law had several provisions relevant to depository institutions, including: 
 Allowing institutions not to characterize loan modifications relating to the COVID-19 pandemic as a troubled debt restructuring and also allowing them to suspend the corresponding impairment determination for accounting purposes 
 As previously noted, temporarily reducing the community bank leverage ratio alternative available to institutions of less than 10 billion of assets to 8 . 
 The ability of a borrower of a federally-backed mortgage loan (VA, FHA, USDA, Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae) experiencing financial hardship due, directly or indirectly, to the COVID-19 pandemic, to request forbearance from paying their mortgage by submitting a request to the borrower s servicer affirming their financial hardship during the COVID-19 emergency. Such a forbearance could be granted for up to 180 days, subject to extensions upon the request of the borrower up to a total of 18 months. During that time, no fees, penalties or interest beyond the amounts scheduled or calculated as if the borrower made all contractual payments on time and in full under the mortgage contract could accrue on the borrower s account. Except for vacant or abandoned property, the servicer of a federally-backed mortgage was prohibited from taking any foreclosure action, including any eviction or sale action. Additional opportunities for forbearance were subsequently made available by the federal agencies and, most recently, certain forbearance options were extended indefinitely through the end of the COVID-19 National Emergency. 
 The ability of a borrower of a multi-family federally backed mortgage loan that was current as of February 1, 2020, to submit a request for forbearance to the borrower s servicer affirming that the borrower is experiencing financial hardship during the COVID-19 emergency. A forbearance could be granted for up to 30 days, which could be extended for up to two additional 30-day periods upon the request of the borrower. Later extensions were made available, for a total of six months, for certain federally backed multi-family mortgage loans. During the time of the forbearance, the multi-family borrower could not evict or initiate the eviction of a tenant or charge any late fees, penalties or other charges to a tenant for late payment of rent. Additionally, a multi-family borrower that received a forbearance could not require a tenant to vacate a dwelling unit before a date that is 30 days after the date on which the 
 25 

borrower provide d the tenant notice to vacate and may not issue a notice to vacate until after the expiration of the forbearance. Most recently, certain forbearance options for borrowers of federally-backed multi -family mortgages were extended indefinitely by federal agencies due to the uncertain nature of the pandemic. 
 The Paycheck Protection Program 
 The CARES Act and the Paycheck Protection Program and Health Care Enhancement Act provided 659 billion to fund loans by depository institutions to eligible small businesses through the Small Business Administration s SBA 7(a) loan guaranty program. These loans are 100 federally guaranteed (principal and interest). An eligible business could apply under the Paycheck Protection Program PPP during the applicable covered period and receive a loan up to 2.5 times its average monthly payroll costs limited to a loan amount of 10.0 million. The proceeds of the loan could be used for payroll (excluding individual employee compensation over 100,000 per year), mortgage, interest, rent, insurance, utilities and other qualifying expenses. PPP loans have: (a) an interest rate of 1.0 , (b) a two-year loan term (or five-year loan term for loans made after June 5, 2021) to maturity and (c) principal and interest payments deferred until the date on which the SBA remits the loan forgiveness amount to the borrower s lender or, alternatively, notifies the lender no loan forgiveness is allowed. If the borrower did not submit a loan forgiveness application to the lender within 10 months following the end of the 24-week loan forgiveness covered period (or the 8-week loan forgiveness covered period with respect to loans made prior to June 5, 2021 if such covered period is elected by the borrower), the borrower would begin paying principal and interest on the PPP loan immediately after the 10-month period. The SBA guarantees 100 of the PPP loans made to eligible borrowers. The entire principal amount of the borrower s PPP loan, including any accrued interest, is eligible to be fully reduced by the loan forgiveness amount under the PPP so long as, during the applicable loan forgiveness covered period, employee and compensation levels of the business are maintained and 60 of the loan proceeds are used for payroll expenses, with the remaining 40 of the loan proceeds used for other qualifying expenses. The PPP ended on May 31, 2021, though existing borrowers may still be eligible for loan forgiveness. As of September 30, 2021 the Company had 180 PPP loans totaling 22.6 million. 
 FEDERAL AND STATE TAXATION 
 Federal Taxation 
 
 General. ESSA Bancorp and the Bank are subject to federal income taxation in the same general manner as other corporations, with some exceptions discussed below. The following discussion of federal taxation is intended only to summarize material federal income tax matters and is not a comprehensive description of the tax rules applicable to ESSA Bancorp and the Bank. 
 Method of Accounting. For federal income tax purposes, ESSA Bancorp currently reports its income and expenses on the accrual method of accounting and uses a tax year ending September 30 for filing its consolidated federal income tax returns. The Small Business Protection Act of 1996 eliminated the use of the reserve method of accounting for bad debt reserves by savings institutions, effective for taxable years beginning after 1995. 
 Bad Debt Reserves. Prior to the Small Business Protection Act of 1996, the Bank was permitted to establish a reserve for bad debts for tax purposes and to make annual additions to the reserve. These additions could, within specified formula limits, be deducted in arriving at the Bank s taxable income. As a result of the Small Business Protection Act of 1996, the Bank must use the specific charge off method in computing its bad debt deduction for tax purposes. 
 Taxable Distributions and Recapture. Prior to the Small Business Protection Act of 1996, bad debt reserves created prior to 1988 were subject to recapture into taxable income if the Bank failed to meet certain thrift asset and definition tests. The Small Business Protection Act of 1996 eliminated these thrift-related recapture rules. However, under current law, pre-1988 reserves remain subject to tax recapture should the Bank make certain distributions from its tax bad debt reserve or cease to maintain a financial institution charter. At September 30, 2021, the Bank s total federal pre-1988 reserve was approximately 4.6 million. This reserve reflects the cumulative effects of federal tax deductions by the Bank for which no federal income tax provision has been made. 
 Minimum Tax. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, imposes an alternative minimum tax at a rate of 20 on a base of regular taxable income plus certain tax preferences, referred to as alternative minimum taxable income. The alternative minimum tax is payable to the extent alternative minimum tax income is in excess of the regular income tax. Net operating losses can, in general, offset no more than 90 of alternative minimum taxable income. Certain payments of alternative minimum tax may be used as credits against regular tax liabilities in future years. At September 30, 2021, the Bank had a 139,000 minimum tax credit carryforward. 
 26 

Net Operating Loss Carryovers. A financial institution may carry back net operating losses to the preceding two taxable years (five years for losses incurred in 2001, 2002 and 2009) and forward to the succeeding 20 taxable years. At September 30, 2021 , the Bank had no net operating loss carryforward for federal income tax purposes. 
 Corporate Dividends. We may exclude from our income 100 of dividends received from the Bank as a member of the same affiliated group of corporations. 
 Audit of Tax Returns. ESSA Bancorp s federal income tax returns have not been audited in the most recent three-year period. The 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020 tax years remain open. The tax returns filed for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2018, 2019 and 2020 represents tax years 2017, 2018 and 2019, respectively. The Company has not yet filed its tax return for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021 which represents the 2020 tax year. 
 State Taxation 
 ESSA Bancorp, Inc. is subject to the Pennsylvania Corporate Net Income Tax. The Corporation Net Income Tax rate for fiscal year 2021 is 10.0 and is imposed on unconsolidated taxable income for federal purposes with certain adjustments. The Bank is subject to tax under the Pennsylvania Mutual Thrift Institutions Tax Act, as amended to include thrift institutions having capital stock. Pursuant to the Mutual Thrift Institutions Tax, the tax rate is 11.5 . The Mutual Thrift Institutions Tax exempts the Bank from other taxes imposed by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania for state income tax purposes and from all local taxation imposed by political subdivisions, except taxes on real estate and real estate transfers. The Mutual Thrift Institutions Tax is a tax upon net earnings, determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles with certain adjustments. The Mutual Thrift Institutions Tax, in computing income according to generally accepted accounting principles, allows for the deduction of interest earned on state and federal obligations, while disallowing a percentage of thrift s interest expense deduction in the proportion of interest income on those securities to the overall interest income of the Bank. Net operating losses, if any, thereafter, can be carried forward three years for Mutual Thrift Institutions Tax purposes. 

Item 1A. 
 
 Risk Factors 

 In addition to factors discussed in the description of our business and elsewhere in this report, the following are factors that could adversely affect our future results of operations and financial condition. 
 Economic and Market Area 
 The COVID-19 pandemic has and will continue to pose risks and could harm business, results of operations and prospects of the Company. 
 The COVID-19 pandemic is having an adverse impact on the Company, its customers and the communities it serves. Given its ongoing and dynamic nature, it is difficult to predict the full impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the business of the Company, its customers, employees and third-party service providers. The extent of such impact will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain, including if and to what extent the coronavirus can be controlled and abated and if the economy may remain open and operate in an efficient manner. Additionally, the responses of various governmental and nongovernmental authorities to curtail business and consumer activities in an effort to mitigate the pandemic will have material long-term effects on the Company and its customers which are difficult to quantify in the near-term or long-term. 
 As the result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the related adverse local and national economic consequences, the Company is subject to the following risks, any of which could have a material, adverse effect on the business, financial condition, liquidity, and results of operations of the Company : 

effects on key employees, including operational management personnel and those charged with preparing, monitoring and evaluating the companies financial reporting and internal controls 

declines in demand for loans and other banking services and products, as well as a decline in the credit quality of our loan portfolio, owing to the effects of COVID-19 in the markets served by the Company 

if the economy is unable to remain open in an efficient manner, loan delinquencies, problem assets, and foreclosures may increase, resulting in increased charges and reduced income 

27 

collateral for loans, especially real estate, may continue to decline in value, which could cause loan losses to increase 

allowance for loan losses may increase if borrowers experience financial difficulties, which will adversely affect net income 

the net worth and liquidity of loan guarantors may decline, impairing their ability to honor commitments 

as the result of the decline in the Federal Reserve Board s target federal funds rate to near 0 , the yield on assets may decline to a greater extent than the decline in cost of interest-bearing liabilities, reducing net interest margin and spread and reducing net income 

cyber security risks are increased as the result of an increase in the number of employees working remotely 

increasing or protracted volatility in the price of the Company s common stock, which may also impair our goodwill and 

risks to the capital markets that may impact the performance of the investment securities portfolio of the Company, as well as limit our access to capital markets and other funding sources. 

Concentration of Loans in Our Primary Market Area May Increase the Risk of Increased Nonperforming Assets. 
 Our success depends primarily on the general economic conditions in the Pennsylvania counties of Monroe, Northampton, Lehigh, Lackawanna, Luzerne, Chester, Delaware and Montgomery as nearly all of our loans are to customers in these markets. Accordingly, the local economic conditions in these market areas have a significant impact on the ability of borrowers to repay loans as well as our ability to originate new loans. As such, decline in real estate values in these market areas would also lower the value of the collateral securing loans on properties in these market areas. In addition, weakening in general economic conditions such as inflation, recession, unemployment or other factors beyond our control could negatively affect our financial results. 
 Strong Competition Within Our Market Areas May Limit Our Growth and Profitability. 
 Competition in the banking and financial services industry is intense. In our market areas, we compete with commercial banks, savings institutions, mortgage brokerage firms, credit unions, finance companies, mutual funds, insurance companies, and brokerage and investment banking firms operating locally and elsewhere. Some of our competitors have greater name recognition and market presence that benefit them in attracting business, and offer certain services that we do not or cannot provide. In addition, larger competitors may be able to price loans and deposits more aggressively than we do, which could affect our ability to grow and remain profitable on a long-term basis. Our profitability depends upon our continued ability to successfully compete in our market areas. For additional information see Item 1. Business Competition. 
 The Soundness of Other Financial Services Institutions May Adversely Affect Our Credit Risk. 
 We rely on other financial services institutions through trading, clearing, counterparty, and other relationships. We maintain limits and monitor concentration levels of our counterparties as specified in our internal policies. Our reliance on other financial services institutions exposes us to credit risk in the event of default by these institutions or counterparties. These losses could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. 
 Changes to LIBOR may adversely impact the value of, and the return on, our loans, investment securities and derivatives which are indexed to LIBOR. 
 On July 27, 2017, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, announced that it will no longer persuade or compel banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR to the LIBOR administrator after 2021. The announcement also indicates that the continuation of LIBOR on the current basis cannot and will not be guaranteed after 2021. Consequently, at this time, it is not possible to predict whether and to what extent banks will continue to provide LIBOR submissions to the LIBOR administrator or whether any additional reforms to LIBOR may be enacted in the United Kingdom or elsewhere. Similarly, it is not possible to predict whether LIBOR will continue to be viewed as an acceptable benchmark for certain loans and liabilities including our subordinated notes, what rate or rates may become accepted alternatives to LIBOR or the effect of any such changes in views or alternatives on the values of the loans and liabilities, whose interest rates are tied to LIBOR. ICE Benchmark Administration IBA ), the authorized and regulated administrator of LIBOR recently announced it would consult on its plans for the discontinuation of 
 28 

LIBOR. IBA intends to end publication of some LIBOR tenors on December 31, 2021 and the remaining LIBOR tenors in June 2023. Financial services regulators and industry groups have collaborated to develop alternate reference rate indices or reference rates. The transition to a new reference rate requires changes to contracts, risk and pricing models, valuation tools, systems, product design and hedging strategies. 
 
 Uncertainty as to the nature of such potential changes, alternative reference rates, the elimination or replacement of LIBOR, or other reforms may adversely affect the value of, and the return on our loans, and our investment securities. 
 Interest Rate and Asset Quality 
 Future Changes in Interest Rates Could Reduce Our Profits. 
 Our ability to make a profit largely depends on our net interest income, which could be negatively affected by changes in interest rates. Net interest income is the difference between: 

1. 
 
 the interest income we earn on our interest-earning assets, such as loans and securities and 

2. 
 
 the interest expense we pay on our interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings. 

 The rates we earn on our assets and the rates we pay on our liabilities are generally fixed for a contractual period of times. Like many banks, our liabilities generally have shorter contractual maturities than our assets. This imbalance can create significant earnings volatility, as market interest rates change over time. In a period of declining interest rates, the interest income earned on our assets may decrease more rapidly than the interest paid on our liabilities, as borrowers speed up prepayments of mortgage loans, and mortgage-backed securities and callable investment securities are called, requiring us to reinvest those cash flows at lower interest rates. In a period of rising interest rates, the interest income earned on our assets may not increase as rapidly as the interest paid on our liabilities. Furthermore, increases in interest rates may adversely affect our ability to originate loans and/or the ability of our borrowers to make loan repayments on adjustable-rate loans, as the interest owed on such loans would increase as interest rates increase. 
 In addition, changes in interest rates can affect the average life of loans and mortgage-backed and related securities. A reduction in interest rates results in increased prepayments of loans and mortgage-backed and related securities, as borrowers refinance their loans in order to reduce their borrowing costs. This creates reinvestment risk, which is the risk that we may not be able to reinvest prepayments at rates that are comparable to the rates we earned on the prepaid loans or securities. Alternatively, increases in interest rates may decrease loan demand and/or make it more difficult for borrowers to repay adjustable rate loans. 
 Changes in interest rates also affect the current market value of our interest-earning securities portfolio. Generally, the value of securities moves inversely with changes in interest rates. At September 30, 2021, the fair value of our investment securities available for sale totaled 240.6 million. Unrealized net gains on these available for sale securities totaled approximately 2.5 million at September 30, 2021 and are reported as a separate component of stockholders equity. Decreases in the fair value of securities available for sale in future periods would have an adverse effect on stockholders equity. 
 We evaluate interest rate sensitivity by estimating the change in the Bank s Economic Value of Equity EVE over a range of interest rate scenarios. EVE is the net present value of the Company s asset cash flows minus the net present value of the Company s liability cash flows. At September 30, 2021, in the event of an immediate 200 basis point increase in interest rates, the Company s model projects that we would experience a 8.9 million, or 2.5 , increase in net portfolio value. See Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Management of Market Risk. 
 Our Continued Emphasis on Commercial Real Estate Lending Increases Our Exposure to Increased Lending Risks. 
 Our business strategy centers on continuing our emphasis on commercial real estate lending. We have grown our loan portfolio in recent years with respect to this type of loan and intend to continue to emphasize this type of lending. At September 30, 2021, 591.1 million, or 43.4 , of our total loan portfolio consisted of commercial real estate loans. Loans secured by commercial real estate generally expose a lender to greater risk of non-payment and loss than one- to four-family residential mortgage loans because repayment of the commercial real estate loans often depends on the successful operation of the property and the income stream of the underlying property. Additionally, such loans typically involve larger loan balances to single borrowers or groups of related borrowers compared to one- to four-family residential mortgage loans. Accordingly, an adverse development with respect to one loan or one credit relationship can expose us to greater risk of loss compared to an adverse development with respect to a one- to four-family residential mortgage loan. We seek to minimize these risks through our underwriting policies, which require such loans to be qualified on the basis of the property s collateral value, net income and debt service ratio however, there is no assurance that our underwriting policies will protect us from credit-related losses. 
 29 

At September 30, 20 2 1 , our largest commercial real estate lending relationship was 1 5 . 7 million of loans located in Lehigh County, Pennsylvania and secured by real estate. These loans were performing in accordance with its repayment terms. See Item 1. Business Lending Activities Commercial Real Estate Loans. 
 Increases to the Allowance for Credit Losses May Cause Our Earnings to Decrease. 
 Our customers may not repay their loans according to the original terms, and the collateral securing the payment of those loans may be insufficient to pay any remaining loan balance. In addition, the estimates used to determine the fair value of such loans as of the acquisition date may be inconsistent with the actual performance of the acquired loans. Hence, we may experience significant credit losses, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. We make various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of our loan portfolio, including the creditworthiness of our borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of loans. In determining the amount of the allowance for credit losses, we rely on loan quality reviews, past loss experience, and an evaluation of economic conditions, among other factors. If our assumptions prove to be incorrect, our allowance for credit losses may not be sufficient to cover losses inherent in our loan portfolio, resulting in additions to the allowance. Material additions to the allowance would materially decrease our net income. 
 Our emphasis on the origination of commercial real estate and business loans is one of the more significant factors in evaluating our allowance for credit losses. As we continue to increase the amount of these loans, additional or increased provisions for credit losses may be necessary and as a result would decrease our earnings. 
 Regulatory Matters 
 A new accounting standard may require us to increase our allowance for loan losses and may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. 
 The Financial Accounting Standards Board has adopted a new accounting standard that will be effective for our first fiscal year after December 15, 2022. This standard, referred to as Current Expected Credit Loss, or CECL, will require financial institutions to determine periodic estimates of lifetime expected credit losses on loans, and recognize the expected credit losses as allowances for credit losses. This will change the current method of providing allowances for credit losses that are probable, which may require us to increase our allowance for loan losses, and may greatly increase the types of data we would need to collect and review to determine the appropriate level of the allowance for credit losses. 
 Bank regulators periodically review our allowance for credit losses and may require us to increase our provision for credit losses or loan charge-offs. Any increase in our allowance for credit losses or loan charge-offs as required by these regulatory authorities could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and/or financial condition. 
 We Operate in a Highly Regulated Environment and May Be Adversely Affected by Changes in Laws and Regulations. 
 We are subject to extensive regulation, supervision, and examination by the Federal Reserve Board, the FDIC and the Department. Such regulators govern the activities in which we may engage, primarily for the protection of depositors. These regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities, including the imposition of restrictions on the operation of a bank, the classification of assets by a bank, the imposition of higher capital requirements, and the adequacy of a bank s allowance for credit losses. Any change in such regulation and oversight, whether in the form of regulatory policy, regulations, or legislation, could have a material impact on us and our operations. We believe that we are in substantial compliance with applicable federal, state and local laws, rules and regulations. Because our business is highly regulated, the laws, rules and applicable regulations are subject to regular modification and change. There can be no assurance that proposed laws, rules and regulations, or any other laws, rules or regulations, will not be adopted in the future, which could make compliance more difficult or expensive or otherwise adversely affect our business, financial condition or prospects.

Security 
 Risks Associated with System Failures, Interruptions, Or Breaches of Security Could Negatively Affect Our Earnings. 
 Information technology systems are critical to our business. We use various technology systems to manage our customer relationships, general ledger, securities investments, deposits, and loans. We have established policies and procedures to prevent or limit the impact of system failures, interruptions, and security breaches (including privacy breaches), but such events may still occur or may not be adequately addressed if they do occur. In addition, any compromise of our systems could deter customers from using our products and services. Although we rely on security systems to provide security and authentication necessary to effect the secure transmission of data, these precautions may not protect our systems from compromises or breaches of security. 
 In addition, we outsource a majority of our data processing to certain third-party providers. If these third-party providers encounter difficulties, or if we have difficulty communicating with them, our ability to adequately process and account for transactions could be affected, and our business operations could be adversely affected. Threats to information security also exist in the processing of customer information through various other vendors and their personnel. 
 The occurrence of any system failures, interruption, or breach of security could damage our reputation and result in a loss of customers and business thereby subjecting us to additional regulatory scrutiny, or could expose us to litigation and possible financial liability. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. 
 Risks Associated with Cyber-Security Could Negatively Affect Our Earnings. 
 The financial services industry has experienced an increase in both the number and severity of reported cyber-attacks aimed at gaining unauthorized access to bank systems as a way to misappropriate assets and sensitive information, corrupt and destroy data, or cause operational disruptions. 
 We have established policies and procedures to prevent or limit the impact of security breaches, but such events may still occur or may not be adequately addressed if they do occur. Although we rely on security safeguards to secure our data, these safeguards may not fully protect our systems from compromises or breaches. 
 We also rely on the integrity and security of a variety of third-party processors, payment, clearing and settlement systems, as well as the various participants involved in these systems, many of which have no direct relationship with us. Failure by these participants or their systems to protect our customers transaction data may put us at risk for possible losses due to fraud or operational disruption. 
 Our customers are also the target of cyber-attacks and identity theft. Large scale identity theft could result in customers accounts being compromised and fraudulent activities being performed in their name. We have implemented certain safeguards against these types of activities but they may not fully protect us from fraudulent financial losses. 
 The occurrence of a breach of security involving our customers information, regardless of its origin, could damage our reputation and result in a loss of customers and business and subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny, and could expose us to litigation and possible financial liability. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.

Item 3 . 
 
 Legal Proceedings 

 The Company and its subsidiaries are subject to various legal actions arising in the normal course of business. In the opinion of Management, the resolution of these legal actions is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company s results of operations. 
 The Bank was named as a defendant in an action commenced on December 8, 2016 by one plaintiff who will also seek to pursue this action as a class action on behalf of the entire class of people similarly situated. The plaintiff alleges that a bank previously acquired by ESSA Bancorp received unearned fees and kickbacks in the process of making loans, in violation of the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act. In an order dated January 29, 2018, the district court granted the Bank s motion to dismiss the case. The plaintiff appealed the court s ruling. In an opinion and order dated April 26, 2019, the appellate court reversed the district court s order dismissing the plaintiff s case against the Bank, and remanded the case back to the district court in order to continue the litigation. The litigation is now proceeding before the district court. On December 9, 2019, the court permitted an amendment to the complaint to add two new plaintiffs to the case asserting similar claims. On May 21, 2020, the court granted the plaintiffs motion for class certification. In an order dated November 24, 2020, the court referred the case to a Magistrate Judge to assist in mediation efforts. The case was stayed while the parties explored the potential for a negotiated resolution. The parties engaged in mediation but did not resolve the matter. The parties are now in the discovery process. The Bank will continue to defend against plaintiffs allegations. To the extent that this matter could result in exposure to the Bank, the amount of such exposure is not currently estimable. 
 On May 29, 2020, the Bank was named as a defendant in a second action commenced by three plaintiffs who will also seek to pursue this action as a class action on behalf of the entire class of people similarly situated. The plaintiffs allege that a bank previously acquired by ESSA Bancorp received unearned fees and kickbacks from a different title company than the one involved in the previously discussed litigation in the process of making loans. The original complaint alleged violations of the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, the Sherman Act, and the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act RICO ). The plaintiffs filed an Amended Complaint on September 30, 2020 that dropped the RICO claim, but they are continuing to pursue the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act and Sherman Act claims. The Bank moved to dismiss the Sherman Act claim on October 14, 2020, and that motion was denied on April 2, 2021. The parties are now in the discovery process. The Bank will continue to defend against plaintiffs allegations. To the extent that this matter could result in exposure to the Bank, the amount of such exposure is not currently estimable.

Item 7. 
 
 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

 Business Strategy 
 Our business strategy is to grow and improve our profitability by: 

Increasing customer relationships through the offering of excellent service and the distribution of that service through effective delivery systems 

Continuing to transform into a full service community bank by meeting the financial services needs of our customers 

Continuing to develop into a high performing financial institution, in part by increasing net interest and fee income and managing operating expenses efficiently 

Remaining within our risk management parameters and 

Employing affordable technology to increase profitability and improve customer service. 

 We intend to continue to pursue our business strategy, subject to changes necessitated by future market conditions and other factors. We also intend to continue focusing on the following: 

Increasing customer relationships through a continued commitment to service and enhancing products and delivery systems. We will continue to increase customer relationships by focusing on customer satisfaction with regard to service, products, systems and operations. We have upgraded and expanded certain of our facilities, including our corporate center and added additional facilities to provide additional capacity to manage future growth and expand our delivery systems. 

Continuing to develop into a high performing financial institution. We will continue to enhance profitability by focusing on increasing non-interest income as well as increasing commercial products, including commercial real estate lending, which often have a higher profit margin than more traditional products. We also will pursue lower-cost commercial deposits as part of this strategy. 

Remaining within our risk management parameters. We place significant emphasis on risk management and compliance training for all of our directors, officers and employees. We focus on establishing regulatory compliance programs to determine the degree of such compliance and to maintain the trust of our customers and community. 

Employing cost-effective technology to increase profitability and improve customer service. We will continue to upgrade our technology in an efficient manner. We have implemented new software for marketing purposes and have upgraded both our internal and external communication systems. 

Continuing our emphasis on commercial real estate lending to improve our overall performance. We intend to continue to emphasize the origination of higher interest rate margin commercial real estate loans as market conditions, regulations and other factors permit. We have expanded our commercial banking capabilities by adding experienced commercial bankers, and enhancing our direct marketing efforts to local businesses. 

Expanding our banking franchise through branching and acquisitions. We will attempt to use our stock holding company structure to expand our market footprint through de novo branching as well as through additional acquisitions of banks, savings institutions and other financial service providers in our primary market area. We will also consider establishing de novo branches or acquiring additional financial institutions in contiguous counties. We will continue to review and assess locations for new branches both within Monroe County and the counties around Monroe. There can be no assurance that we will be able to consummate any new acquisitions or establish any additional new branches. We may continue to explore acquisition opportunities involving other banks and thrifts, and possibly financial service companies, when and as they arise, as a means of supplementing internal growth, filling gaps in our current geographic market area and expanding our customer base, product lines and internal capabilities, although we have no current plans, arrangements or understandings to make any acquisitions. 

Maintaining the quality of our loan portfolio. Maintaining the quality of our loan portfolio is a key factor in managing our growth. We will continue to use customary risk management techniques, such as independent internal and external loan reviews, risk-focused portfolio credit analysis and field inspections of collateral in overseeing the performance of our loan portfolio. 

 37 

Critical Accounting Policies 
 We consider accounting policies that require management to exercise significant judgment or discretion or make significant assumptions that have, or could have, a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets or on income, to be critical accounting policies. We consider the following to be our critical accounting policies: 
 Allowance for Loan Losses. The allowance for loan losses is the estimated amount considered necessary to cover credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date. The allowance is established through the provision for loan losses which is charged against income. In determining the allowance for loan losses, management makes significant estimates and has identified this policy as one of our most critical. The methodology for determining the allowance for loan losses is considered a critical accounting policy by management due to the high degree of judgment involved, the subjectivity of the assumptions utilized and the potential for changes in the economic environment that could result in changes to the amount of the recorded allowance for loan losses. 
 As a substantial amount of our loan portfolio is collateralized by real estate, appraisals of the underlying value of property securing loans and discounted cash flow valuations of properties are critical in determining the amount of the allowance required for specific loans. Assumptions for appraisals and discounted cash flow valuations are instrumental in determining the value of properties. Overly optimistic assumptions or negative changes to assumptions could significantly impact the valuation of a property securing a loan and the related allowance determined. The assumptions supporting such appraisals and discounted cash flow valuations are carefully reviewed by management to determine that the resulting values reasonably reflect amounts realizable on the related loans. 
 Management performs a quarterly evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses. Consideration is given to a variety of factors in establishing this estimate including, but not limited to, current economic conditions, delinquency statistics, geographic and industry concentrations, the adequacy of the underlying collateral, the financial strength of the borrower, results of internal and external loan reviews and other relevant factors. This evaluation is inherently subjective, as it requires material estimates that may be susceptible to significant revision based on changes in economic and real estate market conditions. 
 The analysis of the allowance for loan losses has two components: specific and general allocations. Specific allocations are made for loans that are determined to be impaired. Impairment is measured by determining the present value of expected future cash flows or, for collateral-dependent loans, the fair value of the collateral adjusted for market conditions and selling expenses. The general allocation is determined by segregating the remaining loans by type of loan, risk weighting (if applicable) and payment history. We also analyze historical loss experience, delinquency trends, general economic conditions and geographic and industry concentrations. This analysis establishes factors that are applied to the loan groups to determine the amount of the general allocations. Actual loan losses may be significantly more than the allowance for loan losses we have established which could have a material negative effect on our financial results. 
 Goodwill and Intangible Assets. Goodwill is not amortized, but it is tested at least annually for impairment in the fourth quarter, or more frequently if indicators of impairment are present. If the estimated current fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, no additional testing is required and an impairment loss is not recorded. The Company uses market capitalization and multiples of tangible book value methods to determine the estimated current fair value of its reporting unit. Based on this analysis, no impairment was recorded in fiscal 2021 or fiscal 2020. 
 The other intangibles assets are assigned useful lives, which are amortized on an accelerated basis over their weighted-average lives. The Company periodically reviews the intangible assets for impairment as events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such asset may not be recoverable. Based on these reviews, no impairment was recorded in fiscal 2021 or fiscal 2020. 
 Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. The Company records all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value of derivatives depends on the intended use of the derivative, whether the Company has elected to designate a derivative in hedging relationship and apply hedge accounting and whether the hedging relationship has satisfied the criteria necessary to apply hedge accounting. Derivatives designated and qualifying as a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset, liability, or firm commitment attributable to a particular risk, such as interest rate risk, are considered fair value hedges. Derivatives designated and qualifying as a hedge of the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows, or other types of forecasted transactions, are considered cash flow hedges. Derivatives may also be designated as hedges of the foreign currency exposure of a net investment in a foreign operation. Hedge accounting generally provides for the matching of the timing of gain or loss recognition on the hedging instrument with the recognition of the changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk in a fair value hedge or the earnings effect of the hedged forecasted transactions in a cash flow hedge. The Company may enter into derivative contracts that are intended to economically hedge certain of its risk, even though hedge accounting does not apply or the Company elects not to apply hedge accounting.

Employee Benefit Plans. The Bank maintains a noncontributory, defined benefit pension plan for all employees who have met age and length of service requirements. The Bank also maintains a defined contribution Section 401(k) plan covering eligible employees. The Company created an employee stock ownership plan ESOP for the benefit of employees who meet certain eligibility requirements. The Company makes cash contributions to the ESOP on an annual basis. 
 The Company maintains an equity incentive plan to provide for issuance or granting of shares of common stock for stock options or restricted stock. The Company has recorded stock-based employee compensation cost using the fair value method as allowed under generally accepted accounting principles. Management estimated the fair values of all option grants using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. Management estimated the expected life of the options using the simplified method as allowed under generally accepted accounting principles. The risk-free rate was determined utilizing the treasury yield for the expected life of the option contract. 
 Fair Value Measurements. We group our assets at fair value in three levels, based on the markets in which the assets are traded and the reliability of the assumptions used to determine fair value. These levels are: 

Level I Valuation is based upon quoted prices for identical instruments traded in active markets. 

Level II Valuation is based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model-based valuation techniques for which all significant assumptions are observable in the market. 

Level III Valuation is generated from model-based techniques that use significant assumptions not observable in the market. These unobservable assumptions reflect the Company s own estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset. 

 We base our fair values on the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. It is our policy to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when developing fair value measurements, in accordance with the fair value hierarchy in generally accepted accounting principles. 
 Fair value measurements for most of our assets are obtained from independent pricing services that we have engaged for this purpose. When available, we, or our independent pricing service, use quoted market prices to measure fair value. If market prices are not available, fair value measurement is based upon models that incorporate available trade, bid, and other market information. Subsequently, all of our financial instruments use either of the foregoing methodologies to determine fair value adjustments recorded to our financial statements. In certain cases, however, when market observable inputs for model-based valuation techniques may not be readily available, we are required to make judgments about assumptions market participants would use in estimating the fair value of financial instruments. The degree of management judgment involved in determining the fair value of a financial instrument is dependent upon the availability of quoted market prices or observable market parameters. For financial instruments that trade actively and have quoted market prices or observable market parameters, there is minimal subjectivity involved in measuring fair value. When observable market prices and parameters are not fully available, management judgment is necessary to estimate fair value. In addition, changes in the market conditions may reduce the availability of quoted prices or observable data. When market data is not available, we use valuation techniques requiring more management judgment to estimate the appropriate fair value measurement. Therefore, the results cannot be determined with precision and may not be realized in an actual sale or immediate settlement of the asset. Additionally, there may be inherent weaknesses in any calculation technique, and changes in the underlying assumptions used, including discount rates and estimates of future cash flows, that could significantly affect the results of current or future valuations. 
 Other-than-Temporary Investment Security Impairment. Securities are evaluated periodically to determine whether a decline in their value is other-than-temporary. Management utilizes criteria such as the magnitude and duration of the decline, in addition to the reasons underlying the decline, to determine whether the loss in value is other-than-temporary. The term other-than-temporary is not intended to indicate that the decline is permanent, but indicates that the prospect for a near-term recovery of value is not necessarily favorable, or that there is a lack of evidence to support a realizable value equal to or greater than the carrying value of the investment. Once a decline in value is determined to be other-than-temporary, the value of the security is reduced and a corresponding charge to earnings is recognized. 
 Deferred Income Taxes. We use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. If current available information raises doubt as to the realization of the deferred tax assets, a valuation allowance is established. We consider the determination of this valuation allowance to be a critical accounting policy because of the need to exercise significant judgment in evaluating the amount and timing of recognition of deferred tax liabilities and assets, including projections of future taxable income. These judgments and estimates are reviewed on a continual basis as regulatory and business factors change. A valuation allowance for deferred tax assets may be required if the amount of taxes recoverable through loss 
 39 

carryback declines, or if we project lower levels of future taxable income. Such a valuation allowance would be established through a charge to income tax expense which would adversely affect our operating results. 
 Comparison of Financial Condition at September 30, 2021 and September 30, 2020 
 Total Assets. Total assets decreased 32.1 million, or 1.7 , to 1.9 billion at September 30, 2021, compared to September 30, 2020. 
 Cash and Due from Banks. Cash and due from banks increased 45.4 million, or 44.8 , to 146.8 million at September 30, 2021 from 101.4 million at September 30, 2020. The primary reason for the increase was forgiveness and repayment of PPP loans. 
 Interest-Bearing Deposits with Other Institutions. Interest-bearing deposits with other institutions decreased 42.4 million, or 77.79 , to 12.1 million at September 30, 2021 from 54.5 million at September 30, 2020. The primary reason for the decrease was a shift of funds to cash and due from banks. 
 Investment Securities Available for Sale and Held to Maturity. Investment securities available for sale increased 28.1 million, or 13.2 , to 240.6 million at September 30, 2021 from 212.5 million at September 30, 2020. The increase was due primarily to increases in US government Treasury securities of 75.0 million and corporate securities of 7.1 million, which were offset in part by decreases in US government agency securities of 6.0 million, US government mortgage backed securities of 36.4 million, obligations of states and political subdivisions of 8.6 million and other debt securities of 3.0 million. The Company had 21.5 million in US government mortgage backed securities which were classified as held to maturity at September 30, 2021. 
 Net Loans. Net loans decreased 77.1 million, or 5.5 , to 1.3 billion at September 30, 2021 from September 30, 2020. The primary reasons for the decrease were decreases in residential real estate loans, commercial loans, obligations of states and political subdivisions, auto loans, home equity loans and lines of credit and other loans, offset in part by increases in commercial real estate loans and construction loans. Commercial real estate loans increased by 81.5 million to 591.1 million at September 30, 2021 from 509.6 million at September 30, 2020. Commercial loans decreased 76.1 million to 63.5 million at September 30, 2021 from 139.6 million at September 30, 2020 due primarily declines in PPP loans of 54.1 million. Obligations of states and political subdivisions decreased by 23.1 million to 56.2 million at September 30, 2021 from 79.2 million at September 30, 2020. One- to four-family loans decreased by 29.9 million to 580.3 million at September 30, 2021 from 610.2 million at September 30, 2020. The Company sold 67.5 million in one- to four-family mortgage loans to the Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh during the fiscal year. Home equity loans and lines of credit decreased by 2.4 million to 38.4 million at September 30, 2021 from 40.8 million at September 30, 2020. Auto loans decreased 25.9 million to 13.9 million at September 30, 2021 from 39.8 million at September 30, 2020. The Company discontinued indirect auto lending in July 2018. 
 Deposits. Deposits increased by 92.4 million, or 6.0 , to 1.6 billion at September 30, 2021, primarily as a result of increases in interest bearing demand accounts, money market accounts, savings accounts and non-interest bearing demand accounts partially offset by a decrease in certificates of deposit. Overall, the changes in deposits at September 30, 2021 compared to September 30, 2020 included an increase in non-interest bearing demand accounts of 15.1 million, or 6.2 , an increase in interest bearing demand accounts of 276.4 million, or 100.6 , an increase in money market accounts of 26.4 million, or 6.6 , an increase in savings and club accounts of 28.0 million, or 17.4 , and a decrease in certificates of deposit of 253.6 million, or 54.7 . Included in the certificates of deposit was an increase of 6.8 million, or 3.1 , in brokered certificates of deposit. At September 30, 2021, the Company had 225.0 million of brokered certificates of deposit outstanding. 
 Borrowed Funds. Borrowed funds, short term and other, decreased 125.9 million, or 100.0 , to zero at September 30, 2021 from 125.9 million at September 30, 2020. All borrowed funds are from the FHLB. 
 Stockholders Equity. Stockholders equity increased by 10.4 million, or 5.5 , to 201.8 million at September 30, 2021 from 191.4 million at September 30, 2020. The increase was primarily due to net income of 16.4 million and other comprehensive income of 4.7 million partially offset by cash dividends paid of 4.7 million and common stock repurchases of 7.1 million. 
 Comparison of Operating Results for the Years Ended September 30, 2021 and September 30, 2020 
 Net Income. Net income increased by 2.0 million, or 13.9 , to 16.4 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021 from 14.4 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020. The increase was primarily due to a decrease in interest expense and a decrease in the provision for loan losses partially offset by a decrease in interest income, a decrease in noninterest income, and an increase in noninterest expense and an increase in income taxes. 
 Net Interest Income. Net interest income increased by 4.7 million, or 9.7 , to 52.9 million for fiscal year 2021 from 48.2 million for fiscal year 2020, primarily due to the decreases in interest expense from deposits and short-term borrowings, partially offset by the decrease in total interest income. 
 40 

Interest Income. Interest income de crease d 5.4 million, or 8 . 4 , to 58.7 million for fiscal year 2021 from 64.1 million for fiscal year 2020 . The de crease resulted from a de crease of 28 basis points in the overall yield on interest earning assets to 3.28 from 3.57 , which had the effect of de crea sing interest income by 3.3 million. Also contributing to the de crease was a n 8.8 million de crease in average interest earning assets, which had the effect of de crea sing interest income by 2.1 million . The de crease in average int erest earning assets during 2021 compared to 2020 included decreases in average mortgage backed securities of 122.7 million and average FHLB stock of 8.6 million . These de creases were partially offset by in crease s in average loans of 6.4 million, average other assets of 105.4 million and av erage investment securities of 10.7 millio n. The average yield on loans de creased to 3.91 for the fiscal year 2021 , from 4.01 for the fiscal year 2020 . The average yields on investm ent securities de creased to 2.78 from 3.56 and the average yields on mortgage backed securi ties de creased to 1.55 for 2021 from 2.11 for the 2020 period. 
 Interest Expense. Interest expense decreased 10.1 million, or 63.5 , to 5.8 million for fiscal year 2021 from 15.9 million for fiscal year 2020. The decrease in interest expense resulted from a 66 basis point decrease in the overall cost of interest bearing liabilities to 0.42 for fiscal 2021 from 1.08 for fiscal 2020 which had the effect of decreasing interest expense by 6.9 million along with a decrease in average interest bearing liabilities which had the effect of decreasing interest expense by 3.2 million. For fiscal 2021, average borrowed funds decreased 266.4 million compared to fiscal 2020. Average savings and club accounts increased by 31.6 million, average interest bearing demand deposit accounts increased 49.5 million, average money market accounts increased 51.8 million and average certificates of deposit decreased 59.5 million. The cost of money market accounts decreased to 0.16 for fiscal year 2021 from 0.73 for fiscal year 2020. The cost of interest bearing demand deposit accounts decreased to 0.10 for fiscal year 2021 from 0.29 for fiscal year 2020. The cost of savings and club accounts decreased to 0.05 for fiscal 2021 from 0.06 for fiscal 2020. The cost of certificates of deposit decreased to 0.86 from 1.57 and the cost of borrowed funds decreased to 1.86 from 1.87 for fiscal years 2021 and 2020, respectively. 
 Provision for Loan Losses. The Company establishes provisions for loan losses, which are charged to earnings, at a level necessary to absorb known and inherent losses that are both probable and reasonably estimable at the date of the financial statements. In evaluating the level of the allowance for loan losses, management considers historical loss experience, the types of loans and the amount of loans in the loan portfolio, adverse situations that may affect the borrower s ability to repay, the estimated value of any underlying collateral, peer group information and prevailing economic conditions. This evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available or as future events occur. After an evaluation of these factors, the Company made a provision of 2.7 million for fiscal year 2021 compared to a 3.3 million provision for the 2020 fiscal year. The allowance for loan losses was 18.1 million, or 1.33 of loans outstanding, at September 30, 2021, compared to 15.4 million, or 1.07 of loans outstanding, at September 30, 2020. As the economic effects continue to evolve due to COVID-19 restrictions, our customers may experience decreased cash flows, which may correlate to an inability to make timely loan payments. This, in turn may require further increases in our allowance for loan losses and lead to increases in the level of charge-offs in our loan portfolio. 
 Determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses necessarily involves a high degree of judgment. Management reviews the level of the allowance on a quarterly basis, and establishes the provision for loan losses based on the factors set forth in the preceding paragraph. Historically, the Bank s loan portfolio has consisted primarily of one- to four-family residential mortgage loans. However, our current business plan calls for increases in commercial real estate loan originations. As management evaluates the allowance for loan losses, the increased risk associated with larger non-homogenous commercial real estate may result in large additions to the allowance for loan losses in future periods. Loans secured by commercial real estate generally expose a lender to greater risk of non-payment and loss than one- to four-family residential mortgage loans because repayment of the loans often depends on the successful operation of the property and the income stream of the underlying property. Additionally, such loans typically involve larger loan balances to single borrowers or groups of related borrowers compared to one- to four-family residential mortgage loans. Accordingly, an adverse development with respect to one loan or one credit relationship can expose us to greater risk of loss compared to an adverse development with respect to a one- to four-family residential mortgage loan. 
 Although we believe that we use the best information available to establish the allowance for loan losses, future additions to the allowance may be necessary, based on estimates that are susceptible to change as a result of changes in economic conditions and other factors. In addition, the FDIC, as an integral part of its examination process, will periodically review our allowance for loan losses. This agency may require us to recognize adjustments to the allowance, based on its judgments about information available to it at the time of its examination. 
 Non-Interest Income. Non-interest income decreased 1.8 million, or 13.3 , to 11.5 million for the year ended September 30, 2021, from 13.3 million for the comparable 2020 period. The decrease was primarily due to decreases in gain on sale of investments, net of 2.5 million, loan swap fees of 642,000, earnings on bank owned life insurance of 90,000 and insurance commissions of 186,000. These decreases were offset, in part, by increases in service fees on deposit accounts of 167,000, service charges and fees on loans of 476,000, gain on sale of loans, net of 707,000, trust and investment fees of 150,000 and other noninterest income of 100,000. Gain on sale of investments, net included a one-time gain of 2.5 million related to a deleveraging

strategy the C ompany executed in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2020 . During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 , the Company identified approximately 123.0 million of higher cost FHLB advances with a weighted average coupon of approximately 2.0 . The Company utilized the proceeds from the sale of approximately 89.0 million of investment securities along with approximately 34.0 million of cash to prepay the identified FHLB advances. The gain from the sale of the investment securities approximated the prepayment penalty for the prepayment of the FHLB advances. 
 Non-Interest Expense. Non-interest expense increased 1.2 million, or 3.0 , to 41.8 million for fiscal year 2021 from 40.6 million for the comparable period in 2020. The primary reasons for the increase in noninterest expense were increases in compensation and employee benefits of 2.0 million, occupancy and equipment of 137,000, professional fees of 201,000, data processing of 263,000, advertising of 155,000 FDIC insurance premiums of 364,000 and other expenses of 995,000. These increases were partially offset by decreases in prepayment on FHLB advances of 2.5 million and gain on foreclosed real estate of 623,000. Foreclosed real estate included a one-time deferred income credit related to a former foreclosed real estate property of 534,000. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, the Company identified approximately 123.0 million of higher cost FHLB advances with a weighted average coupon of approximately 2.0 . The Company utilized the proceeds from the sale of approximately 89.0 million of investment securities along with approximately 34.0 million of cash to prepay the identified FHLB advances. The gain from the sale of the investment securities approximated the prepayment penalty for the prepayment of the FHLB advances. 
 Income Taxes. Income tax expense of 3.5 million was recognized for fiscal year 2021 compared to an income tax expense of 3.2 million recognized for fiscal year 2020. The effective tax rate for the year ended September 30, 2021 was 17.5 compared to 18.1 for the 2020 period.

Rate/Volume Analysis 
 The following table presents the effects of changing rates and volumes on our net interest income for the years indicated. The rate column shows the effects attributable to changes in rate (changes in rate multiplied by prior volume). The volume column shows the effects attributable to changes in volume (changes in volume multiplied by prior rate). The net column represents the sum of the prior columns. For purposes of this table, changes attributable to both rate and volume, which cannot be segregated, have been allocated proportionately based on the changes due to rate and the changes due to volume.

Management of Market Risk 
 General. The majority of our assets and liabilities are monetary in nature. Consequently, our most significant form of market risk is interest rate risk. Our assets, consisting primarily of loans, having longer maturities than our liabilities, consisting primarily of deposits and borrowings. As a result, a principal part of our business strategy is to manage interest rate risk and reduce the exposure of our net interest income to changes in market interest rates. Accordingly, our Board of Directors has approved guidelines for managing the interest rate risk inherent in our assets and liabilities, given our business strategy, operating environment, capital, liquidity and performance objectives. Senior management monitors the level of interest rate risk on a regular basis and the asset/liability committee meets quarterly to review our asset/liability policies and interest rate risk position. We have sought to manage our interest rate risk in order to minimize the exposure of our earnings and capital to changes in interest rates. 
 Net interest income, which is the primary source of the Company s earnings, is impacted by changes in interest rates and the relationship of different interest rates. To manage the impact of the rate changes, the balance sheet should be structured so that repricing opportunities exist for both assets and liabilities at approximately the same time intervals. The Company uses net interest simulation to assist in interest rate risk management. The process includes simulating various interest rate environments and their impact on net interest income. As of September 30, 2021, the level of net interest income at risk in a 200 basis points increase or a 100 basis point decrease was within the Company s policy limit of a decline less than 10 of net interest income. 
 44 

The following table sets forth the results of the twelve month projected net interest incom e model as of September 30, 2021 .

The above table indicates that as of September 30, 2021, in the event of a 400 basis point instantaneous increase in interest rates, the Company would experience an 11.9 , or 5.9 million, increase in net interest income. In the event of a 100 basis point decrease in interest rates, the Company would experience a 6.3 , or 3.1 million, decrease in net interest income. 
 Another measure of interest rate sensitivity is to model changes in the economic value of equity through the use of immediate and sustained interest rate shocks. The following table illustrates the economic value of equity model results as of September 30, 2021.

The preceding table indicates that as of September 30, 2021, in the event of an immediate and sustained 400 basis point increase in interest rates, the Company would experience a 3.6 , or 12.5 million, increase in the present value of equity. If rates were to decrease 100 basis points, the Company would experience a 17.7 , or 61.9 million, decrease in the present value of equity. 
 Certain shortcomings are inherent in the methodologies used in the above interest rate risk measurements. Modeling changes in net interest income requires the making of certain assumptions regarding prepayment and deposit decay rates, which may or may not reflect the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates. While management believes such assumptions are reasonable, there can be no assurance that assumed prepayment rates and decay rates will approximate actual future loan prepayment and deposit withdrawal activity. Moreover, the net interest income table presented assumes that the composition of interest sensitive assets and liabilities existing at the beginning of a period remains constant over the period being measured and also assumes that a particular change in interest rates is reflected uniformly across the yield curve regardless of the duration to maturity or repricing of specific assets and liabilities. Accordingly, although the net interest income table provides an indication of the Company s interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time, such measurement is not intended to and does not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on net interest income and will differ from actual results. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 We maintain liquid assets at levels we consider adequate to meet both our short-term and long-term liquidity needs. We adjust our liquidity levels to fund deposit outflows, repay our borrowings and to fund loan commitments. We also adjust liquidity as appropriate to meet asset and liability management objectives. 
 Our primary sources of liquidity are deposits, amortization and prepayment of loans and mortgage-backed securities, maturities of investment securities and other short-term investments, and earnings and funds provided from operations, as well as access to FHLB advances and other borrowings. While scheduled principal repayments on loans and mortgage-backed securities are a relatively predictable source of funds, deposit flows and loan prepayments are greatly influenced by market interest rates, economic conditions, and rates offered by our competition. We set the interest rates on our deposits to maintain a desired level of total deposits. 
 45 

A portion of our liquidity consists of cash and cash equivalents and borrowings, which are a product of our operating, investing and financing a ctivities. At September 30, 2021 , 15 8 .9 million of our assets were invested in cash and cash equivalents. Our primary sources of cash are principal repayments on loans, proceeds from the maturities of investment securities, principal repayments of mortgage-backed securities and increases in deposit accounts. There were 100 . 0 million in s hort-term investment securities (maturing in one year or less) at September 30, 2021 . As of September 30, 2021 , we had no borrowings outstanding from the FHLB-Pittsburgh. We have access to FHLB advanc es of up to approximately 7 26.3 million. 
 At September 30, 2021, we had 254.4 million in loan commitments outstanding, which included 166.5 million in undisbursed construction loans, 50.0 million in unused home equity lines of credit and 86.3 million in commercial lines of credit. Certificates of deposit due within one year of September 30, 2021 totaled 158.8 million, or 75.6 of certificates of deposit. If these maturing deposits do not remain with us, we will be required to seek other sources of funds, including other certificates of deposit and borrowings. Depending on market conditions, we may be required to pay higher rates on such deposits or other borrowings than we currently pay on the certificates of deposit due on or before September 30, 2021. We believe, however, based on past experience that a significant portion of our certificates of deposit will remain with us. We have the ability to attract and retain deposits by adjusting the interest rates offered. 
 As reported in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, our cash flows are classified for financial reporting purposes as operating, investing or financing cash flows. Net cash provided by operating activities was 19.4 million and 19.8 million for the years ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. These amounts differ from our net income because of a variety of cash receipts and disbursements that did not affect net income for the respective periods. Net cash provided by investing activities was 31.8 million and 15.4 million in fiscal years 2021 and 2020, respectively, principally reflecting our loan and investment security activities in the respective periods. Cash proceeds from principal repayments, maturities and sales of investment securities amounted to 111.4 million and 168.8 million in the years ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Deposit and borrowing cash flows have traditionally comprised most of our financing activities which resulted in net cash (used for) provided by financing activities of (48.1) million in fiscal year 2021, and 68.5 million in fiscal year 2020. 
 We also have obligations under our post retirement plan as described in Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The post retirement benefit payments represent actuarially determined future payments to eligible plan participants. We froze our pension plan in fiscal year 2017. 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements. In the normal course of operations, we engage in a variety of financial transactions that, in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles are not recorded in our financial statements. These transactions involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit, interest rate and liquidity risk. Such transactions are used primarily to manage customers requests for funding and take the form of loan commitments and lines of credit. For information about our loan commitments, letters of credit and unused lines of credit, see Note 10 of the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company also uses derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate risk. For information about the Company s derivatives and hedging activities, see Note 17 of the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 For fiscal year 2021, we did not engage in any off-balance-sheet transactions other than loan origination commitments and standby letters of credit in the normal course of our lending activities. The Company used derivative financial instruments as part of its interest rate hedging activities in 2021. 
 Impact of Inflation and Changing Prices 
 The financial statements and related notes of ESSA Bancorp have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles GAAP ). GAAP generally requires the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without consideration for changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation. The impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of our operations. Unlike industrial companies, our assets and liabilities are primarily monetary in nature. As a result, changes in market interest rates have a greater impact on performance than the effects of inflation.

 Controls and Procedures 

(a) 
 
 Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures. 

 Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Principle Executive Officer and Principle Financial Officer, we evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the fiscal year (the Evaluation Date ). Based upon that evaluation, the Principle Executive Officer and Principle Financial Officer concluded that, as of the Evaluation Date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective. 

(b) 
 
 Changes in internal controls. 

 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

(c) 
 
 Management report on internal control over financial reporting. 

 The management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. The Company s internal control system is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance to the Company s management and board of directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements. 
 Our internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect transactions and dispositions of assets provide reasonable assurances that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and the directors of ESSA Bancorp and provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of ESSA Bancorp s assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements. 
 All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
 ESSA Bancorp, Inc. s management assessed the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2021. In making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth in 2013, by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control-Integrated Framework . Based on our assessment we believe that, as of September 30, 2021, the Company s internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria. 
 The Annual Report on Form 10-K does not include an attestation report of the Company s registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management s report was not subject to attestation by the Company's registered public accounting firm pursuant to exemption rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission that permit the Company to provide only management's report in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

REPORT ON MANAGEMENT S ASSESSMENT OF INTERNAL CONTROL 
 OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING 
 ESSA Bancorp, Inc. (the Company is responsible for the preparation, integrity, and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report. The consolidated financial statements and notes included in this annual report have been prepared in conformity with United States generally accepted accounting principles and necessarily include some amounts that are based on management s best estimates and judgments. 
 We, as management of the Company, are responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting that is designed to produce reliable financial statements in conformity with United States generally accepted accounting principles. The system of internal control over financial reporting as it relates to the financial statements is evaluated for effectiveness by management and tested for reliability. Actions are taken to correct potential deficiencies as they are identified. Any system of internal control, no matter how well designed, has inherent limitations, including the possibility that a control can be circumvented or overridden and misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, because of changes in conditions, internal control effectiveness may vary over time. Accordingly, even an effective system of internal control will provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation. 
 Management assessed the Company s system of internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2021, in relation to criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting as described in Internal Control Integrated Framework, issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in 2013. Based on this assessment, management concludes that, as of September 30, 2021, its system of internal control over financial reporting is effective and meets the criteria of the Internal Control Integrated Framework .

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
 To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of ESSA Bancorp, Inc. 
 Opinion on the Financial Statements 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of ESSA Bancorp, Inc. and subsidiary (the Company as of September 30, 2021 and 2020 the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in stockholders equity, and cash flows for the years then ended and the related notes to the consolidated financial statements (collectively, the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of September 30, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
 Basis for Opinion 
 These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent, with respect to the Company, in accordance with U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, and audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 
 
 Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 . 
 Critical Audit Matters 
 
 The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter, in any way, our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.

Allowance for Loan Losses (ALL) Qualitative Factors 
 Description of the Matter 
 The Company s loan portfolio totaled 1.4 billion as of September 30, 2021, and the associated ALL was 18.1 million. As discussed in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements, determining the amount of the ALL requires significant judgment about the collectability of loans, which includes an assessment of quantitative factors such as historical loss experience within each risk category of loans and testing of certain commercial loans for impairment. Management applies additional qualitative adjustments to reflect the inherent losses that exist in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date that are not reflected in the historical loss experience. Qualitative adjustments are made based upon changes in economic conditions, portfolio composition trends, classified loan trends, delinquency trends, and external factors. 
 Auditing the Company s ALL involved a high degree of subjectivity due to the judgement involved in management s determination of commercial loan credit risk ratings and identification and measurement of qualitative factor adjustments included in the estimate of the allowance for loan losses. 
 How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit 
 We gained an understanding of the Company s process for establishing the ALL, including the qualitative adjustments made to the ALL. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company s ALL process, which included, among others, management s review and approval controls designed to assess the need and level of qualitative adjustments to the ALL, as well as the reliability of the data utilized to support management s assessment. 
 To test the qualitative adjustments, we evaluated the appropriateness of management s methodology and assessed whether all relevant risks were reflected in the ALL and the need to consider qualitative adjustments, including the potential effect of COVID-19 on the adjustments. 
 Regarding the measurement of the qualitative adjustments, we evaluated the completeness, accuracy, and relevance of the data and inputs utilized in management s estimate. For example, we compared the inputs and data to the Company s historical loan performance data and third-party macroeconomic data. Furthermore, we analyzed the changes in the components of the qualitative reserves relative to changes in external market factors, the Company s loan portfolio, and asset quality trends, which included the evaluation of management s ability to capture and assess relevant data from both external sources and internal reports on loan customers affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and the supporting documentation for substantiating revisions to qualitative factors. 
 We also utilized internal credit review specialists to perform procedures on a sample of commercial loans to test the Company s credit risk ratings by comparing key attributes used in the determination of the credit risk rating to supporting documentation such as borrowers financial statements, underlying collateral, financial health of the guarantor, and loan payment history. 
 We have served as the Company s auditor since 2005.

 days past due or the Company has serious doubts about further collectability of principal or interest, even though the loan is currently performing. A loan may remain on accrual status if it is in the process of collection and is either guaranteed or well secured. When a loan is placed on nonaccrual status, unpaid interest credited to income is reversed. Interest received on nonaccrual loans generally is either applied against principal or reported as interest income, according to the Company s judgment as to the collectability of principal. Generally, loans are restored to accrual status when the obligation is brought current and has performed in accordance with the contractual terms for a reasonable period of time and the ultimate collectability of the total contractual principal and interest is no longer in doubt.

 A loan is considered to be a troubled debt restructuring TDR loan when the Company grants a concession to the borrower because of the borrower s financial condition that it would not otherwise consider. Such concessions include the reduction of interest rates, forgiveness of principal or interest, or other modifications of interest rates that are less than the current market rate for new obligations with similar risk. TDR loans that are in compliance with their modified terms and that yield a market rate may be removed from the TDR status after one year of performance. basis points of the outstanding member asset value plus percent of its outstanding FHLB borrowings, as calculated throughout the year. The equity security is accounted for at cost and classified separately on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The stock is bought from and sold to the FHLB based upon its par value. The stock does not have a readily determinable fair value and as such is classified as restricted stock, carried at cost and evaluated by management. The stock s value is determined by the ultimate recoverability of the par value rather than by recognizing temporary declines. The determination of whether the par value will ultimately be recovered is influenced by criteria such as the following: (a) The significance of the decline in net assets of the FHLB as compared to the capital stock amount and the length of time this situation has persisted (b) commitments by the FHLB to make payments required by law or regulation and the level of such payments in relation to the operating performance (c) the impact of legislative and regulatory changes on the customer base of the FHLB and (d) the liquidity position of the FHLB. With consideration given to these factors, management concluded that the stock was not impaired at September 30, 2021. and , respectively.

During 2021 the Company participated in the Paycheck Protection Program PPP ), administered directly by the U.S. SBA. The PPP provides loans to small businesses who were affected by economic conditions as a result of COVID-19 to provide cash-flow assistance to employers who maintain their payroll (including healthcare and certain related expenses), mortgage interest, rent, leases, utilities and interest on existing debt during the COVID-19 emergency. As of September 30, 2021, the Company had outstanding principal balances of million compared to million on September 30, 2020. The PPP loans are fully guaranteed by the SBA and may be eligible for forgiveness by the SBA to the extent that the proceeds are used to cover eligible payroll costs, interest costs, rent, and utility costs over a period of up to 24 weeks after the loan is made as long as certain conditions are met regarding employee retention and compensation levels. PPP loans deemed eligible for forgiveness by the SBA will be repaid by the SBA to the Company. PPP loans are included in the Commercial loan category. 
 
 In accordance with the SBA terms and conditions on the outstanding PPP loans of million as of September 30, 2021, the Company has approximately in unamortized fees associated with the processing of these loans.

The Company maintains a loan review system, which allows for a periodic review of our loan portfolio and the early identification of potential impaired loans. Such system takes into consideration, among other things, delinquency status, size of loans, type and market value of collateral, and financial condition of the borrowers. Specific loan loss allowances are established for identified losses based on a review of such information. A loan evaluated for impairment is considered to be impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. All loans identified as impaired are evaluated independently. The Company does not aggregate such loans for evaluation purposes. Impairment is measured on a loan-by-loan basis for commercial and construction loans by the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate, the loan s obtainable market price, or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral-dependent.

The Company uses a ten-point internal risk-rating system to monitor the credit quality of the overall loan portfolio. The first categories are considered not criticized and are aggregated as Pass-rated. The criticized rating categories utilized by management generally follow bank regulatory definitions. The Special Mention category includes assets that are fundamentally sound yet, exhibit potentially unacceptable credit risk or deteriorating trends or characteristics which if left uncorrected, may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the asset or in the Company s credit position at some future date. Loans in the Substandard category have well-defined weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt and have a distinct possibility that some loss will be sustained if the weaknesses are not corrected. All loans greater than days past due are considered Substandard. Loans in the Doubtful category have all the weaknesses inherent in one classified Substandard with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, highly questionable and improbable. Loans in the Loss category are considered uncollectible and of little value that their continuance as bankable assets is not warranted. 
 To help ensure that risk ratings are accurate and reflect the present and future capacity of borrowers to repay a loan as agreed, the Company has a structured loan rating process with several layers of internal and external oversight. Generally, consumer and residential mortgage loans are included in the Pass categories unless a specific action, such as bankruptcy, repossession, or death, occurs to raise awareness of a possible credit event. The Company s Commercial Loan Officers are responsible for the timely and accurate risk rating of the loans in their portfolios at origination and on an ongoing basis. The Company s Commercial Loan Officers perform an annual review of all commercial relationships or greater. Confirmation of the appropriate risk grade is included in the review on an ongoing basis. The Company engages an external consultant to conduct 
 F-26 
 
 and/or all criticized relationships equal to or greater than . Detailed reviews, including plans for resolution, are performed on loans classified as Substandard on a quarterly basis. Loans in the Special Mention and Substandard categories that are evaluated for impairment are given separate consideration in the determination of the allowance.

All other loans are underwritten and structured using standardized criteria and characteristics, primarily payment performance, and are normally risk rated and monitored collectively on a monthly basis. These are typically loans to individuals in the consumer categories and are delineated as either performing or nonperforming. 
 For residential real estate loans, construction real estate loans, home equity loans and lines of credit, auto loans, and other loans, the Company evaluates credit quality based on the performance of the individual credits.

There were loans greater than 90 days delinquent and still accruing interest at September 30, 2021 and 2020. 
 
 The allowance for loan losses ALL is maintained at a level necessary to absorb loan losses that are both probable and reasonably estimable. Management, in determining the allowance for loan losses, considers the losses inherent in its loan portfolio and changes in the nature and volume of loan activities, along with the general economic and real estate market conditions. The allowance for loan losses consists of three elements: (1) an allocated allowance, which comprises allowances established on specific loans and class allowances based on historical loss experience and current trends, (2) an allocated allowance based on general economic conditions and other risk factors in our markets and portfolios, and (3) an unallocated allowance not to exceed of total reserves which acts as a contingency against unforeseen future events which may negatively impact the Company s loan portfolio. We maintain a loan review system, which allows for a periodic review of our loan portfolio and the early identification of potential impaired loans. Such system takes into consideration, among other things, delinquency status, size of loans, type and market value of collateral, and financial condition of the borrowers. General loan loss allowances are based upon a combination of factors including, but not limited to, actual loan loss experience, composition of the loan portfolio, current economic conditions, management s judgment and losses which are probable and reasonably estimable. The allowance is increased through provisions charged against current earnings and recoveries of previously charged-off loans.

The allowance for loan losses is based on estimates, and actual losses will vary from current estimates. Management believes that the granularity of the homogeneous pools and the related historical loss ratios and other qualitative factors, as well as the consistency in the application of assumptions, result in an ALL that is representative of the risk found in the components of the portfolio at any given date. During the year ended September 30, 2021 the Company recorded provision for loan losses for the construction loan, commercial real estate and commercial loan segments, due to either increased loan balances, changes in the loan mix within the pool, and/or charge-off activity in those segments. Credit provisions were recorded for the residential real estate, obligations of states and political subdivisions, home equity loans and lines of credit, other segments and auto loan segments due to either decreased loan balances, changes in the loan mix within the pool, and/or charge-off activity in those segments. During the year ended September 30, 2020 the Company recorded provision for loan losses for the residential real estate, construction loan, commercial real estate, obligations of states and political subdivisions, home equity loans and lines of credit and other segments, due to either increased loan balances, changes in the loan mix within the pool, and/or charge-off activity in those segments. Credit provisions were recorded for the commercial loan and auto loan segments due to either decreased loan balances, changes in the loan mix within the pool, and/or charge-off activity in those segments.

The Company establishes a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets when management believes that the deferred tax assets are not likely to be realized either through a carryback to taxable income in prior years, future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, and, to a lesser extent, future taxable income. 
 Accounting principles prescribe a recognition threshold and a measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Benefits from tax positions should be recognized in the financial statements only when it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the appropriate taxing authority that would have full knowledge of all relevant information. A tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Tax positions that previously failed to meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold should be recognized in the first subsequent financial reporting period in which that threshold is met. Previously recognized tax positions that no longer meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold should be derecognized in the first subsequent financial reporting period in which that threshold is no longer met.

Standby letters of credit 

Unfunded lines of credit 

The commitments outstanding at September 30, 2021, contractually mature in . 
 The instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The Company uses the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as it does for on-balance sheet instruments. The amount of collateral obtained, as deemed necessary, is based upon management s credit evaluation in compliance with the lending policy guidelines. Since many of the credit line commitments are expected to expire without being fully drawn upon, the total contractual amounts do not necessarily represent future funding requirements. 
 Standby letters of credit and financial guarantees represent conditional commitments issued to guarantee performance of a customer to a third party. The coverage period for these instruments is typically a one-year period with renewal option subject to prior approval by management. Fees earned from the issuance of these letters are recognized over the coverage period. For secured letters of credit, the collateral is typically Company deposit instruments. 
 The Company is required to maintain a reserve balance with certain third party providers. At September 30, 2021 the reserve balance was million.

In an order dated November 24, 2020, the court referred the case to a Magistrate Judge to assist in mediation efforts. The case was stayed while the parties explored the potential for a negotiated resolution. The parties engaged in mediation but did not resolve the matter. The parties are now in the discovery process. The Bank will continue to defend against plaintiffs allegations. To the extent that this matter could result in exposure to the Bank, the amount of such exposure is not currently estimable. 
 On May 29, 2020, the Bank was named as a defendant in a second action commenced by plaintiffs who will also seek to pursue this action as a class action on behalf of the entire class of people similarly situated. The plaintiffs allege that a bank previously acquired by ESSA Bancorp received unearned fees and kickbacks from a different title company than the one involved in the previously discussed litigation in the process of making loans. The original complaint alleged violations of the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, the Sherman Act, and the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act RICO ). The plaintiffs filed an Amended Complaint on September 30, 2020 that dropped the RICO claim, but they are continuing to pursue the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act and Sherman Act claims. The Bank moved to dismiss the Sherman Act claim on October 14, 2020, and that motion was denied on April 2, 2021. The parties are now in the discovery process. The Bank will continue to defend against plaintiffs allegations. To the extent that this matter could result in exposure to the Bank, the amount of such exposure is not currently estimable. 

, the Company adopted ASU No. 2016-02 Leases (Topic 842) and all subsequent ASUs that modified Topic 842. For the Company, Topic 842 primarily affected the accounting treatment for operating lease agreements in which the Company is the lessee. 
 
 Lessee Accounting 
 
 Substantially all of the leases in which the Company is the lessee are comprised of real estate property for branches, ATM locations, and office space with terms extending through . All of our leases are classified as operating leases, and therefore, were previously not recognized on the Company s Consolidated Balance sheet. With the adoption of Topic 842, operating lease agreements are required to be recognized on the Consolidated Balance sheet as a right-of-use ROU asset and a corresponding lease liability.

The Company makes cash contributions to the ESOP on an annual basis sufficient to enable the ESOP to make the required loan payments. Cash dividends paid on allocated shares are distributed to participants and cash dividends paid on unallocated shares are used to repay the outstanding debt of the ESOP. The ESOP trust s outstanding loan bears interest at prime, adjustable each January 1 st , which was at September 30, 2021 and requires an annual payment of principal and interest through of . The Company s ESOP, which is internally leveraged, does not report the loans receivable extended to the ESOP as assets and does not report the ESOP debt due to the Company. 
 As the debt is repaid, shares are released from the collateral and allocated to qualified employees based on the proportion of payments made during the year to the remaining amount of payments due on the loan through maturity. Accordingly, the shares pledged as collateral are reported as unallocated common stock held by the ESOP shares in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. As shares are released from collateral, the Company reports compensation expense equal to the current market price of the shares, and the shares become outstanding for earnings-per-share computations. The Company recognized ESOP expense of and , for the years ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

Defined Benefit Plan 
 The Bank sponsors a trusteed, noncontributory defined benefit pension plan covering substantially all employees and officers. The plan calls for benefits to be paid to eligible employees at retirement based primarily upon years of service with the Bank and compensation rates near retirement. The Bank s funding policy is to make annual contributions, if needed, based upon the funding formula developed by the plan s actuary. In February 2017, the Bank amended the defined benefit pension plan to provide that no additional participants would enter the plan and no additional benefits would accrue beyond February 28, 2017.

Each financial asset and liability is identified as having been valued according to a specified level of input, 1, 2 or 3. Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access at the measurement date. Fair values determined by Level 2 inputs utilize inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset, either directly or indirectly. Level 2 inputs include quoted prices for similar assets in active markets, and inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset, and include situations where there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability. In certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In such cases, the level in the fair

 Fair value is generally determined through independent appraisals of the underlying collateral, which generally include various level 3 inputs which are not identifiable.

 Appraisals may be adjusted by management for qualitative factors such as economic conditions and estimated liquidation expenses. The range of liquidation expenses and other appraisal adjustments are presented as a percent of the appraisal. 
 
 Investment Securities Available for Sale 
 The fair value of securities available for sale are determined by obtaining quoted market prices on nationally recognized securities exchanges (Level 1), or matrix pricing (Level 2), which is a mathematical technique used widely in the industry to value debt securities without relying exclusively on quoted market prices for the specific securities but rather by relying on the securities relationship to other benchmark quoted prices. For certain securities which are not traded in active markets or are subject to transfer restrictions, valuations are adjusted to reflect illiquidity and/or non-transferability, and such adjustments are generally based on available market evidence (Level 3). In the absence of such evidence, management s best estimate is used. Management s best estimate consists of both internal and external support on certain Level 3 investments. Internal cash flow models using a present value formula that includes assumptions market participants would use along with indicative exit pricing obtained from broker/dealers (where available) are used to support fair values of certain Level 3 investments, if applicable. 
 Equity Securities 
 The fair value of equity securities are determined by obtaining quoted market prices on nationally recognized securities exchanges (Level 1). 
 Impaired Loans 
 The Company has measured impairment on impaired loans generally based on the fair value of the loan s collateral. Evaluating impaired loan collateral is based on Level II inputs utilizing outside appraisals. Those impaired loans for which management incorporates significant adjustments for sales costs and other discount assumptions regarding market conditions are considered Level III fair values. The fair value consists of the loan balances of million less their valuation allowances of at September 30, 2021. The fair value consists of the loan balances of million less their valuation allowances of at September 30, 2020. 
 Foreclosed Real Estate Owned 
 Foreclosed real estate owned is measured at fair value, less cost to sell at the date of foreclosure valuations are periodically performed by management and the assets are carried at fair value, less cost to sell. Income and expenses from operations and changes in valuation allowance are included in the net expenses from foreclosed real estate. 
 Derivatives 
 The Company s objectives in using interest rate derivatives are to add stability to interest income and expense and to manage its exposure to interest rate movements. To accomplish this objective, the Company has entered into interest rate swaps as part of

Cash Flow Hedges of Interest Rate Risk 
 The Company s objectives in using interest rate derivatives are to add stability to interest income and expense and to manage its exposure to interest rate movements. To accomplish this objective, the Company has entered into interest rate swaps as part of its interest rate risk management strategy. These interest rate swaps are designated as cash flow hedges and involve the receipt of variable rate amounts from a counterparty in exchange for the Company making fixed payments. As of September 30, 2021, the Company had interest rate swaps with a notional of million associated with the Company s cash outflows associated with various brokered deposits and million associated with commercial loans. As of September 30, 2020, the Company had interest rate swaps with a notional of million associated with the company s cash outflows associated with various FHLB advances and million associated with commercial loans. 
 For derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, the effective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is initially reported in other comprehensive income (outside of earnings), net of tax, and subsequently reclassified to earnings when the hedged transaction affects earnings, and the ineffective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is recognized directly in earnings. The Company assesses the effectiveness of each hedging relationship by comparing the changes in cash 
 F-47 
 
 million and in losses classified to interest expense, respectively. During the next twelve months, the Company estimates that will be reclassified as an increase in interest expense.

Exhibit 10.11 
 
 ESSA BANK TRUST 
 
 AMENDED AND RESTATED 
 EXECUTIVE/MANAGEMENT 
 ANNUAL INCENTIVE COMPENSATION PLAN 

This Amended and Restated Executive/Management Annual Incentive Compensation Plan (the Plan ), is effective October 1, 2015. Every year, a new Attachment A will be developed which will set forth the specific performance goals for each fiscal year. 

I. 
 
 Purpose 

The purpose of the Plan is to provide incentive compensation to executive officers and members of management who contribute to the success of ESSA Bank Trust ESSA throughout the entire fiscal year. The Plan is designed to support organizational objectives and financial goals for the entire fiscal year, as defined by ESSA s strategic and financial plans and performance that measures up well relative to comparable financial organizations as well. Incentive compensation payments awarded will reflect the full fiscal year performance relative to expectations and will be designed to align pay competitiveness with fiscal year organizational performance relative to the budget. The Plan is designed to supplement base salary, but is not an entitlement. It is designed to provide variable pay at risk based on full fiscal year performance of ESSA. 
 In addition to providing competitive pay opportunity, the Plan is also intended to support ESSA s pay for performance philosophy. It is also designed to assist ESSA in attracting, retaining and motivating leadership talent and to provide focus on achieving important fiscal year objectives of the organization. 
 Participants in this Plan will not be entitled to payments under any broad-based employee bonus plan. This provides for greater simplicity and clarity regarding the linkage of pay and performance. 
 The Plan is designed to accomplish the following objectives: 

Support ESSA s pay for performance philosophy . 

Establish line of sight between fiscal year executive/management efforts, results and pay. 

Enhance ESSA s ability to attract, retain, focus and motivate the leadership talent it needs to achieve profitable growth. 

II. 
 
 General Description 

The Plan value is based on paying for fiscal year attainment of pre-established annual performance goals and provides for a range of payouts aligned with performance, requiring satisfactory performance throughout the entire fiscal year as determined by management. Fiscal year performance goals are based on a combination of business plan and external benchmarks for comparable financial services organizations. Performance below the range will yield no payouts under the Plan. Fiscal year incentive compensation is capped at the maximum performance levels established each year. 
 Performance ranges will be established for each fiscal year (i.e., October 1 to September 30) and will be set forth as Attachment A to the Plan. Performance measures used may vary from year to year, based on fiscal year objectives approved by the Compensation Committee (the Committee of the Board of Directors (the Board ). Payouts can range from zero up to 150 of target. The Committee has the authority to consider and authorize payouts within the range, but performance below the range will result in no payouts under the Plan and no payouts will be made above the maximum performance levels established each year. Payouts under the Plan require ESSA to maintain safety and soundness while achieving financial objectives. 

Incentives are funded and budgeted for the full fiscal year at the target level of payout in aggregate for all Plan participants. 
 The Committee, in its sole discretion, has the right to reduce a Plan participant s fiscal year payout based on a number of factors, including but not limited to, a non-financial performance objective, such as individual conduct or performance (referred to as negative discretion ), and in no event will the Committee exercise discretion to increase a Plan participant s payout (positive discretion is prohibited). Such negative adjustments would be expected to be exceptions, and as a result of a negative adjustment, an individual payout could be deemed as unearned. No payout is earned until the actual payment date which may vary each year. Payment is conditioned, among other factors, on being and having been actively and continuously employed throughout the fiscal year and until the payment date. An exception may be made, in whole or in part, in the sole discretion of the Committee, if a participant terminates employment or is terminated from employment prior to the payment date as a result of death, disability continuing more than six (6) months, or retirement. 

III. 
 
 Plan Administration 

 The Committee will approve any final disposition of matters pertaining to administration of the Plan. The Committee has the responsibility to interpret, administer, amend, suspend or terminate the Plan and such decisions shall be final and binding on all parties. Matters of the Committee shall be decided by majority vote. 
 Computation of awards will be conducted by ESSA. Accrued payouts and the financial results they are based on shall be reviewed for reasonableness by independent auditors prior to payment. 
 The Committee may take into consideration any nonrecurring or extraordinary items that affect income gain, expense or loss and other factors it may deem relevant. We define extraordinary items as events and transactions that are distinguished by their unusual nature and by the infrequency of their occurrence (extraordinary items exclude mergers and acquisitions). For this purpose, unusual nature means that the event or transaction should possess a high degree of abnormality and be of a type clearly unrelated to the ordinary and typical activities of the entity. Infrequency of occurrence means that the event or transaction should be of a type that would not reasonably be expected to recur in the foreseeable future. In general, the Committee will apply a consistent logic to how such matters are considered to impact incentive Plan payouts. This means that extraordinary gains and losses will be dealt with in a similar manner. The overarching criteria used to make such decisions will be the protection of ESSA and its shareholders. 

IV. 
 
 Plan Participation 

Participation in the Plan is limited to selected executive officers and management of ESSA. Selection is based on the functional responsibilities and the extent to which the employee has the opportunity to influence the desired organizational results. Final decisions are based on CEO recommendation and Committee approval. In general, the participant pool will be selected from individuals in the positions set forth on Attachment B. 
 
 V. Payout Mechanics 
 
 The fiscal year payout ranges as a percentage of base incumbent base salaries are established for each fiscal year and are set forth on Attachment A. 
 Eligible participants generally will receive their appropriate incentive Plan payouts in a single cash lump sum distribution within 2 months following the end of the fiscal year. The fiscal year incentive Plan payouts are calculated based on base salary from October 1 st through September 30 th (excluding bonus, short term disability benefits, and commissions). 
 Annual bonus payouts will not be deemed earned until the actual payment date, which may vary from year to year. Participants must be actively employed on the payment date or the full payout amount will be lost and deemed unearned. No payout will be made, in whole or part, to a participant who is not employed and on active status on the actual payment date. An exception may be made, in whole or in part, in the sole discretion of the Committee, if a 
 2 

participant terminates employment or is terminated from employment prior to the payment date as a result of death, disability continuing more than six (6) months, or retirement. 
 In addition, new participants must have been actively and continuously employed on or before April 1 st of the fiscal year to be eligible to participate in the Plan that year with the payout calculated on base earnings from hire date through the end of the fiscal year. Those not actively and continuously employed on or before April 1 st will not be eligible to participate in the Plan until the next fiscal year, beginning October 1 st . This partial year eligibility criteria is solely for purposes of first year admission to the Plan. Partial year employment is otherwise not considered and will be disqualifying. No rights or interests in the Plan shall be assignable or transferable, or subject to any lien, directly, by operation of law, or otherwise, including levy, garnishment, attachment, pledge, or bankruptcy except to a beneficiary upon the death of a participant as herein provided. 
 An award does not confer any right on the participant to continue in the employ of ESSA or limit in any way the right of ESSA to terminate the participant s employment at any time. There shall be no guarantee for a payment under the Plan. 
 ESSA has the right to deduct any federal, state, and local taxes required by law to be withheld with respect to incentive compensation. 
 ESSA may reduce or eliminate any bonus in its entirety if the Committee determines that a participant made egregious errors or acted improperly. 
 ESSA has the discretion to consider relevant facts and circumstances in making bonus determinations, including the employee s work performance throughout the fiscal year and future commitment to ESSA. 
 ESSA retains the right to modify, eliminate or replace the bonus Plan at any time and from time to time as it determines in its sole discretion.
