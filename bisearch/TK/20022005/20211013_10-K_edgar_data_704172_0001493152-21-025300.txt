CO2-1-0
(CARBON) CORP 

In
August 2021, PHI Group signed a Letter of Intent with Indonesia-based CYFS Group, headed by Mr. Choky Fernando Simanjuntak, to sponsor
and co-found CO2-1-0 (CARBON) CORP to implement a new disruptive carbon mitigation initiative through environmentally sustainable projects
starting in Indonesia, Vietnam, other ASEAN countries, and worldwide. On September 21, 2021 CO2-1-0 (CARBON) CORP was incorporated as
a Wyoming corporation to manage this program. PHI Group will contribute a major portion of the development budget and will hold 50.1 
shares of CO2-1-0 (CARBON). 

According
to the United Nation Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), together with the Paris agreement and Kyoto protocol in 2016, where
Indonesia has actively participated and agreed to maintain the earth temperature not to exceed by 1,5 degrees Celsius by 2030. The greenhouse
gases (GHG), mainly CO2, CH4, N2O, SF6, HFCs, PFCs, are the root cause of global climate change, each of which can be calculated as CER
(CO2 Emission Reduction) equivalent. The target for Indonesia is 834 million tonnes of CER by 2030. 

Currently,
CER is being tediously registered, validated, and certified centrally under UNFCCC methodology by a few independent institutions, mostly
in the US and Europe, where the CER later can be traded (as carbon credits) voluntarily. For the past 5 years, the market for carbon
credits is nearly zero, and due to complexity of the processes, many companies/ projects have less appetite to be engaged into the carbon
credit opportunity. Many environmentally sustainable projects (renewable energy/ waste/ agriculture/forestry/ etc.) have failed to get
financial support especially at the initial/ development stage, due to the above reasons, causing less economic value of the project
or delays. 

Though
the carbon market is still on hibernate stage, CER value is estimated to rise to US 100/ ton CER by 2030, while crypto currency is just
starting and has attracted many millennials and gen-Z who are more aware to green environment and sustainability (recent survey result,
Indonesian college students, 12-13 July 2021). It is believed that from year 2022 onward the world will witness the boom of renewable
energy projects/ sustainability initiatives that are related to Carbon Credits, with an enormous market size of 23 Giga tones of CO2
emission to be reduced in 2030. The Taskforce on Scaling Voluntary Carbon Markets (TSVCM), sponsored by the Institute of International
Finance (IIF) with knowledge support from McKinsey, estimates that demand for carbon credits could increase by a factor of 15 or more
by 2030 and by a factor of up to 100 by 2050. Overall, the market for carbon credits could be worth upward of 50 billion in 2030. 

CO2-1-0
(CARBON) aims to provide a solution in disruptive decentralized new carbon market system using blockchain technology which will be empowering
environmentally sustainable projects (renewable energy/ waste/ agriculture/ forestry/ etc.) starting in Indonesia, Vietnam, other ASEAN
countries and worldwide. It has a clear and systematic product development roadmap, and the ultimate milestones of the products estimated
to be launched in the near future. The solution, methodology, and improved TACCC (transparent, accurate, consistent, complete, and comparable)
business process originally introduced by CO2-1-0 (CARBON) will bring full impact to better environment and life of millions.

areas required for continuing our operations. We cannot assure that we will be able to retain our key personnel or that we will be able
to attract, train or retain qualified personnel in the future. 

Risks
Related to Mergers and Acquisitions 

Our
strategy in mergers and acquisitions involves a number of risks and we have a limited history of successful acquisitions. Even when an
acquisition is completed, we may have to continue our service for integration that may not produce results as positive as management
may have projected. 

The
Company continues evaluating various opportunities and negotiating to acquire other companies, assets and technologies. Acquisitions
entail numerous risks, including difficulties in the assimilation of acquired operations and products, diversion of management s
attention from other business concerns, amortization of acquired intangible assets and potential loss of key employees of acquired companies.
We have limited experience in assimilating acquired organizations into our operations. Although potential synergy may be achieved by
acquisitions of related technologies and businesses, no assurance can be given as to the Company s ability to integrate successfully
any operations, personnel, services or products that have been acquired or might be acquired in the future. Failure to successfully assimilate
acquired organizations could have a material adverse effect on the Company s business, financial condition and operating results. 

8 

Acquisitions
involve a number of special risks, including: 

failure
 of the acquired business to achieve expected results; 

diversion
 of management s attention; 

failure
 to retain key personnel of the acquired business; 

additional
 financing, if necessary and available, could increase leverage, dilute equity, or both; 

the
 potential negative effect on our financial statements from the increase in goodwill and other intangibles; and 

the
 high cost and expenses of completing acquisitions and risks associated with unanticipated events or liabilities. 

These
risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition since the values of the securities
received for the consulting service at the execution of the acquisition depend on the success of the company involved in acquisition.
In addition, our ability to further expand our operations through acquisitions may be dependent on our ability to obtain sufficient working
capital, either through cash flows generated through operations or financing activities or both. There can be no assurance that we will
be able to obtain any additional financing on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. 

Risks
associated with private equity (PE) funds 

There
are, broadly, five key risks to private equity investing: 

1.
 Operational risk: The risk of loss resulting from inadequate processes and systems supporting the organization. It is a
key consideration for investors regardless of the asset classes that funds invest into. 

2.
 Funding risk: This is the risk that investors are not able to provide their capital commitments and is effectively the
 investor default risk . PE funds typically do not call upon all the committed investor capital and only draw capital once
they have identified investments. Funding risk is closely related to liquidity risk, as when investors are faced with a funding shortfall
they may be forced to sell illiquid assets to meet their commitments. 

3.
 Liquidity risk: This refers to an investor s inability to redeem their investment at any given time. PE investors
are locked-in for between five and ten years, or more, and are unable to redeem their committed capital on request during
that period. Additionally, given the lack of an active market for the underlying investments, it is difficult to estimate when the investment
can be realized and at what valuation. 

4.
 Market risk: There are many forms of market risk affecting PE investments, such as broad equity market exposure, geographical/sector
exposure, foreign exchange, commodity prices, and interest rates. Unlike in public markets where prices fluctuate constantly and are
marked-to-market, PE investments are subject to infrequent valuations and are typically valued quarterly and with some element of subjectivity
inherent in the assessment. However, the market prices of publicly listed equities at the time of sale of a portfolio company will ultimately
impact realization value. 

5.
 Capital risk: The capital at risk is equal to the net asset value of the unrealized portfolio plus the future undrawn commitments.
In theory, there is a risk that all portfolio companies could experience a decline in their current value, and in the worst-case drop
to a valuation of zero. Capital risk is closely related to market risk. Whilst market risk is the uncertainty associated with unrealized
gains or losses, capital risk is the possibility of having a realized loss of the original capital at the end of a fund s life. 

There
are two main ways that capital risk brings itself to bear - through the failure of underlying companies within the PE portfolio and suppressed
equity prices which make exits less attractive. The former is impacted by the quality of the fund manager, i.e. their ability to select
portfolio companies with good growth prospects and to create value, hence why fund manager selection is key for investors. The condition,
method, and timing of the exit are all factors that can affect how value can be created for investors.

Risks
Associated with Building and Operating a Diamond Exchange 

Fundamentally,
the key requirements for a successful diamond exchange include the following: 

1.
 Supply : One of the most important things for a successful trading hub is the ability to secure ample, stable, and sustainable
supply of commodities. In the case of a diamond exchange, adequate supply of rough diamond must be secured to make it successful. 

2.
 Capital : Besides the infrastructure, facilities, systems, and amenities to operate the diamond exchange, the organizers
must be able to arrange very large amounts of capital to facilitate the trade and other business activities related to the exchange. 

3.
 Participants : The organizers must be able to attract a large number of international diamonteers to participate in the
exchange. There is no guarantee that people will come when the exchange is built. 

4.
 Venue: The venue must be able to provide competitive advantages compared with existing diamond exchanges in the world in
terms of (a) modern facilities, latest technologies and state-of-the-art provisions, (b) tax relief, (c) financial facilitating network
from big investors, (d) retail banking, lending institutions and foreign exchange facilities, (e) licenses and registrations, (f) global
multi-commodities trading flatform, and (g) other amenities. 

Risks
Associated with International Markets 

As
some of our business activities are currently involved with international markets, any adverse change to the economy or business environment
in these countries could significantly affect our operations, which would lead to lower revenues and reduced profitability . 

Some
of our business activities are currently involved with non-US countries. Because of this presence in specific geographic locations, we
are susceptible to fluctuations in our business caused by adverse economic or other conditions in this region, including stock market
fluctuation. A stagnant or depressed economy in these countries generally, or in any of the other markets that we serve, could adversely
affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. 

Risks
Related to Our Securities 

Insiders
have substantial control over the company, and they could delay or prevent a change in our corporate control, even if our other stockholders
wanted such a change to occur. 

Though
our executive officers and directors as of the date of this report, in the aggregate, only hold a small portion of our outstanding common
stock, we have the majority voting rights associated with the Company s Class B Series I Preferred Stock, which decision may allow
the Board of Directors to exercise significant control over all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors
and approval of significant corporate transactions. This could delay or prevent an outside party from acquiring or merging with us even
if our other stockholders wanted it to occur. 

The
price at which investors purchase our common stock may not be indicative of the prevailing market price. 

The
stock market often experiences significant price fluctuations that are unrelated to the operating performance of the specific companies
whose stock is traded. These market fluctuations could adversely affect the trading price of our shares. Investors may be unable to sell
their shares of common stock at or above their purchase price, which may result in substantial losses. 

10 

Since
we do not currently meet the requirements for our stock to be quoted on NASDAQ, NYSE MKT LLC or any other senior exchange, the tradability
in our securities will be limited under the penny stock regulations. 

Under
the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, as the price of our securities on the OTCQB or OTC Markets is below 5.00 per share,
our securities are within the definition of a penny stock. As a result, it is possible that our securities may be subject
to the penny stock rules and regulations. Broker-dealers who sell penny stocks to certain types of investors are required
to comply with the Commission s regulations concerning the transfer of penny stock. These regulations require broker-dealers to: 

Make
a suitability determination prior to selling penny stock to the purchaser; 

 Receive
the purchaser s written consent to the transaction; and 

 Provide
certain written disclosures to the purchaser. 

These
requirements may restrict the ability of broker/dealers to sell our securities, and may affect the ability to resell our securities. 

Our
compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and SEC rules concerning internal controls may be time consuming, difficult and costly for us. 

It
may be time consuming, difficult and costly for us to develop and implement the internal controls and reporting procedures required by
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. We may need to hire additional financial reporting, internal controls and other finance staff in order to develop
and implement appropriate internal controls and reporting procedures. If we are unable to comply with the internal controls requirements
of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, we may not be able to obtain the independent accountant certifications that the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires
publicly traded companies to obtain.

Holders
of Common Equity: 

As
of October 10, 2021, there are approximately 1,586 shareholders of record of the Company s common stock, of which 1,287 are active. 

Dividends: 

Cash
dividend: The Company has not declared or paid a cash dividend to common stock shareholders since the Company s inception. The
Board of Directors presently intends to retain any earnings to finance company operations and does not expect to authorize cash dividends
to common shareholders in the foreseeable future. Any payment of cash dividends in the future will depend upon Company s earnings,
capital requirements and other factors. 

Share
dividend: On March 12, 2012 the Board of Directors of the Company declared a special stock dividend to shareholders of Common Stock of
the Company with the following stipulations: (a) Declaration date: March 16, 2012; (b) Record date: June 15, 2012; (c) Payment date:
September 17, 2012; (d) Dividend ratio: All eligible shareholders of Common Stock of the Company as of the Record date shall receive
three new shares of Common Stock of the Company for each share held by such shareholders as of the referenced record date. The purpose
of this special stock dividend was to partially mitigate the impact of the dilution in connection with the 1-for-1,500 reverse split
of the Common Stock on the Company s long-term shareholders and reward them for staying with the Company. On June 6, 2012, the
Company s Board of Directors passed a resolution to change the record date for the special stock dividend to July 31, 2012 and
the distribution date to November 30, 2012. The Company has reserved a total of 5,673,327 shares of Common Stock for this special dividend
distribution and will reset a new distribution date when a registration statement for the dividend shares is declared effective by the
Securities and Exchange Commission.

in professional services, and a decrease of 52,5000 in salaries and wages fees between the two fiscal periods. The decrease in professional

(loss) from operations: 

The
Company had a loss from operations of 888,184 for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021 as compared to a loss from operations of 1,861,207
for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020. This represents a decrease of 973,023 in loss from operations during the current fiscal year

increase of 56,557 in interest expenses, a decrease of 750,751 in other income, and an increase in other expenses in the amount of
 5,844,278. The Company recognized 104,356 as other income in connection with a gain in settlement of debt in the amount of 87,228,
a refund of 10,650 and total adjustments of 6,458 from the accounts of the Luxembourg bank funds during the fiscal year ended June
30, 2021 as compared to a total of 855,107 as other income from derivative gains during the same period in 2020. As for other expenses,
the Company incurred 5,860,341 under this category during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021, primarily due to loss on issuance
of stock in the amount of 2,431,914, loss on conversion of notes in the amount of 2,558,325, loss on note discounts of 215,216,
penalties of 174,987 and financing origination costs of 28,070 as compared to 16,063 in other expenses during the previous fiscal
year.

income (loss):

based on the basic and diluted weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2021 and June
30, 2020 was both (0.00). 

CASH
FLOWS 

We
had in cash and cash equivalents of 95,344 as of June 30, 2021 as compared to 225,381 in cash and cash equivalents as of June 30, 2020,
respectively. 

Net
cash provided by our operating activities was 158,720 for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021 as compared to cash used
in operating activities of (720,125) for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020. 

The
underlying reasons for the variance in net cash provided by and used in operating activities between the two fiscal year
periods were mainly due to an increase in net loss from operations of 5,678,563, a net increase of 6,885,045 due to
conversion of notes, a net decrease in assets and prepaid expenses of 770,632 and a net increase in accounts payable
and accrued expenses of 521,324 between the two fiscal years.

was 406,427 in cash used in investing activities during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021, compared to no cash provided by
or used in investing activities during the same period ended June 30, 2020. 

Net
cash provided by financing activities was 117,670 for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021 as compared with 873,827 for the fiscal
year ended June 30, 2020. The net cash provided by financing activities for the current fiscal year primarily came from loans from officers
and directors in the amount of 24,049 and 112,530 from issuance of common stock for cash.

FINANCIAL
PLANS 

MATERIAL
CASH REQUIREMENTS: We must raise substantial amounts of capital to fulfill our plans for PHILUX Global Funds and for acquisitions. We
intend to use equity, debt and project financing to meet our capital needs for acquisitions and investments. 

Management
has taken action and formulated plans to meet the Company s operating needs through June 30, 2022 and beyond. The working capital
cash requirements for the next 12 months are expected to be generated from operations, sale of marketable securities and additional financing.
The Company plans to generate revenues from its consulting services, merger and acquisition advisory services, and acquisitions of target
companies with cash flows. 

AVAILABLE
FUTURE FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS: The Company may use various sources of funds, including short-term loans, long-term debt, equity capital,
and project financing as may be necessary. The Company believes it will be able to secure the required capital to implement its business
plan. 

EQUITY
LINE FACILITY 

On
March 6, 2017, PHI Group, Inc., a Nevada corporation (the Company and Azure Capital, a Massachusetts Corporation (the
 Investor entered into an Investment Agreement (the Investment Agreement and a Registration Rights Agreement
(the Registration Rights Agreement ), each dated March 6, 2017 between the Company and the Investor. 

Pursuant
to the Investment Agreement, the Investor committed to purchase, subject to certain restrictions and conditions, up to 10,000,000 worth
of the Company s common stock, over a period of 36 months from the effectiveness of the registration statement registering the
resale of shares purchased by the Investor pursuant to the Investment Agreement. The Company agreed to initially reserve 20,000,000 shares
of its Common Stock for issuance to the Investor pursuant to the Investment Agreement. In the event the Company cannot register a sufficient
number of shares of its Common Stock for issuance pursuant to the Investment Agreement, the Company will use its best efforts to authorize
and reserve for issuance the number of shares required for the Company to perform its obligations in connection with the Investment Agreement
as soon as reasonably practical. 

This
Investment Agreement was amended on August 3, 2017 to allow for the reservation of 65,445,000 shares of the Company s Common Stock
for issuance to the Investor pursuant to the corrected Investment Agreement. 

The
Company has filed a S-1 Registration Statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission to include 7,936,600 shares of its Common

ITEM
7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 

The
following discussion about PHI Group Inc. s market risk involves forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially
from those projected in the forward-looking statements. 

Currency
Fluctuations and Foreign Currency Risk 

Some
of our acquisition targets and partner companies are located outside of the United States and use currencies other than the U.S. dollar
as the official currencies of those countries. The fluctuations of exchange rates in these countries may affect the value of our business. 

Interest
Rate Risk 

We
do not have significant interest rate risk, as most of our debt obligations are primarily short-term in nature to individuals, with fixed
interest rates. 

Valuation
of Securities Risk 

Since
some of our income in the past was paid with the marketable securities, the value of our assets may fluctuate significantly depending
on the market value of the securities we hold.

 NOTES
TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

NOTE
1 NATURE OF BUSINESS 

PHI
Group, Inc. (the Company or PHI ( www.phiglobal.com is primarily engaged in the operations of PHILUX
Global Funds, SCA, SICAV-RAIF, a Reserved Alternative Investment Fund RAIF under the laws of Luxembourg,

investment in agriculture, renewable energy, real estate, infrastructure, healthcare and the Asia Diamond Exchange in Vietnam. 

BACKGROUND 

Originally
incorporated on June 8, 1982 as JR Consulting, Inc., a Nevada corporation, the Company operated as a Nevada corporation until June 30,
2020 when it filed a Certificate of Dissolution with the Secretary of State of Nevada and started to operate as a Wyoming corporation
pursuant to the Articles of Domestication filed with the Wyoming Secretary of State on September 20, 2017. In the beginning, the Company
was foremost engaged in mergers and acquisitions and had an operating subsidiary, Diva Entertainment, Inc., which operated modeling agencies
in New York and California. In January 2000, the Company changed its name to Providential Securities, Inc., a Nevada corporation, following
a business combination with Providential Securities, Inc., a California-based financial services company. In February 2000 the Company
then changed its name to Providential Holdings, Inc. In October 2000, Providential Securities withdrew its securities brokerage membership
and ceased its financial services business. Subsequently, in April 2009, the Company changed its name to PHI Group, Inc. From October
2000 to October 2011, the Company and its subsidiaries were engaged in mergers and acquisitions advisory and consulting services, real
estate and hospitality development, mining, oil and gas, telecommunications, technology, healthcare, private equity, and special situations.
In October 2011, the Company discontinued the operations of Providential Vietnam Ltd., Philand Ranch Limited, a United Kingdom corporation
listed on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange (together with its subsidiaries Philand Ranch - Singapore, Philand Corporation - US, and Philand
Vietnam Ltd. - Vietnam), PHI Gold Corporation (formerly PHI Mining Corporation, a Nevada corporation and publicly traded company), and
PHI Energy Corporation (a Nevada corporation), and mainly focused on acquisition and development opportunities in energy and natural
resource businesses.

NOTE
2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 

PRINCIPLES
OF CONSOLIDATION 

The
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of PHI Group, Inc., its wholly owned subsidiaries (1) PHILUX Global Funds SCA,
SICAV-RAIF, a Luxembourg bank fund designed to hold a number of subfund compartments for investing in various selective industries, (2)
PHI Luxembourg Development S.A., the mother holding company for PHILUX Global Funds, (3) PHI Luxembourg Holding S.A., (4) PHILUX Global
General Partner S.A., (5) PHILUX Capital Advisors, Inc., a Wyoming corporation (100 ), American Pacific Resources, Inc., a Wyoming corporation
(100 ), and (6) American Pacific Plastics, Inc., a Wyoming corporation, collectively referred to as the Company. All significant
inter-company transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. 

USE
OF ESTIMATES 

The
preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure
of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during
the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 

CASH
AND CASH EQUIVALENTS 

The
Company considers all liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less from the date of purchase that are readily convertible
into cash to be cash equivalents. 

MARKETABLE
SECURITIES 

The
Company s securities are classified as available-for-sale and, as such, are carried at fair value. Securities classified as available-for-sale
may be sold in response to changes in interest rates, liquidity needs, and for other purposes. 

Each
investment in marketable securities typically represents less than twenty percent (20 of the outstanding common stock and stock equivalents
of the investee, and each security is quoted on a national exchange or on the OTC Markets. As such, each investment is accounted for
in accordance with the provisions of ASC 320 (previously SFAS No. 115). 

Unrealized
holding gains and losses for available-for-sale securities are excluded from earnings and reported as a separate component of stockholder s
equity. Realized gains and losses for securities classified as available-for-sale are reported in earnings based upon the adjusted cost
of the specific security sold. On June 30, 2021 and 2020 the marketable securities have been recorded at 385,457 and 235,088, respectively,
based upon the fair value of the marketable securities at that time. 

ACCOUNTS
RECEIVABLE 

Management
reviews the composition of accounts receivable and analyzes historical bad debts. There was no account receivable or bad debt during
the fiscal ended June 30, 2021. 

IMPAIRMENT
OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS 

Effective
January 1, 2002, the Company adopted ASC 350 (Previously SFAS 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets ),
which addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long-lived assets and supersedes SFAS No. 121, Accounting
for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed Of, and the accounting and reporting provisions
of APB Opinion No. 30, Reporting the Results of Operations for a Disposal of a Segment of a Business. The Company periodically
evaluates the carrying value of long-lived assets to be held and used in accordance with ASC 350. ASC 350 requires impairment losses
to be recorded on long-lived assets used in operations when indicators of impairment are present and the undiscounted cash flows estimated
to be generated by those assets are less than the assets carrying amounts. In that event, a loss is recognized based on the amount
by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair market value of the long-lived assets. Loss on long-lived assets to be disposed of is determined
in a similar manner, except that fair market values are reduced for the cost of disposal. 

F- 7 

PROPERTY
AND EQUIPMENT 

Property
and equipment are stated at cost. Maintenance and repair costs are charged to expense as incurred; costs of major additions and betterments
are capitalized. When property and equipment are sold or otherwise disposed of, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are eliminated
from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is reflected in income. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over
the estimated useful lives of the assets, ranging from three to ten years. 

DEPRECIATION
AND AMORTIZATION 

The
cost of property and equipment is depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the related assets. Depreciation and amortization of
fixed assets are computed on a straight-line basis. 

NET
EARNINGS (LOSS) PER SHARE 

The
Company adopted the provisions of ASC 260 (previously SFAS 128). ASC 260 eliminates the presentation of primary and fully diluted earnings
per share EPS and requires presentation of basic and diluted EPS. Basic EPS is computed by dividing income (loss) available
to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted EPS is based on the weighted-average
number of shares of common stock outstanding for the period and common stock equivalents outstanding at the end of the period. 

The
net earnings (loss) per share is computed as follows:

STOCK-BASED
COMPENSATION 

Effective
July 1, 2006, the Company adopted ASC 718-10-25 (previously SFAS 123R) and accordingly has adopted the modified prospective application
method. Under this method, ASC 718-10-25 is applied to new awards and to awards modified, repurchased, or cancelled after the effective
date. Additionally, compensation cost for the portion of awards that are outstanding as of the date of adoption for which the requisite
service has not been rendered (such as unvested options) is recognized over a period of time as the remaining requisite services are
rendered. 

FAIR
VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 

Fair
Value - Definition and Hierarchy 

Fair
value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between
market participants at the measurement date. Assets and liabilities measured at fair value are categorized based on whether or not the
inputs are observable in the market and the degree that the inputs are observable. The categorization of financial assets and liabilities
within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. 

A
fair value hierarchy for inputs is used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of
unobservable inputs by requiring that the most observable inputs are to be used when available. 

F- 8 

Valuation
techniques that are consistent with the market or income approach are used to measure fair value. The fair value hierarchy is categorized
into three levels based on the inputs as follows: 

Level
 1 - Valuations based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Fund has the ability
to access. 

Level
 2 - Valuations based on inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly. 

Level
3 - Valuations based on inputs that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement. 

Fair
value is a market-based measure, based on assumptions of prices and inputs considered from the perspective of a market participant that
are current as of the measurement date, rather than an entity-specific measure. Therefore, even when market assumptions are not readily
available, the Company s own assumptions are set to reflect those that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability
at the measurement date. The availability of valuation techniques and observable inputs can vary from investment to investment and are
affected by a wide variety of factors, including; type of investment, whether the investment is new and not yet established in the marketplace,
the liquidity of markets, and other characteristics particular to the transaction. 

To
the extent that valuation is based upon models or inputs that are less observable or unobservable in the market, the determination of
fair value requires more judgment. Because of the inherent uncertainty of valuation, those estimated values may be materially higher
or lower than the values that would have been used had a ready market for the investments existed. Accordingly, the degree of judgment
exercised by the Fund in determining fair value is greatest for investments categorized in Level 3. In certain cases, the inputs used
to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In such cases, the level in the fair value hierarchy
in which the fair value measurement falls in its entirety is determined based upon the lowest level input that is significant to the
fair value measurement. 

Fair
Value - Valuation Techniques and Inputs 

The
Company holds and may invest public securities traded on public exchanges or over-the-counter (OTC), private securities, real estate,
convertible securities, interest bearing securities and other types of securities and has adopted specific techniques for their respective
valuations. 

Equity
Securities in Public Companies 

Unrestricted 

The
Company values investments in securities that are freely tradable and listed on major securities exchanges at their last reported sales
price as of the valuation date. To the extent these securities are actively traded and valuation adjustments are not applied, they are
categorized in Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. 

Securities
traded on inactive markets or valued by reference to similar instruments are generally categorized in Level 2 or 3 of the fair value
hierarchy. 

Restricted 

Securities
traded on public exchanges or over-the-counter (OTC) where there are formal restrictions that limit (i.e. Rule 144 holding periods and
underwriter s lock-ups) their sale shall be valued at the closing price on the date of valuation less applicable discounts. The
Company may apply a discount to securities with Rule 144 restrictions. Additional discounts may be assessed if the Company believes there
are other mitigating factors which warrant the additional discounting. When determining potential additional discounts, factors that
will be taken into consideration include, but are not limited to; securities trading characteristics, volume, length and overall
impact of the restriction as well as other macro-economic factors. Valuations should be discounted appropriately until the securities
may be freely traded. 

F- 9 

If
it has been determined that the exchange or OTC listed price does not accurately reflect fair market value, the Company may elect to
treat the security as a private company and apply an alternative valuation method. 

Investments
in restricted securities of public companies may be included in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. However, to the extent that significant
inputs used to determine liquidity discounts are not observable, investments in restricted securities in public companies may be categorized
in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. 

The
Company s financial instruments primarily consist of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, marketable securities, short-term
notes payable, convertible notes, derivative liability and accounts payable. 

As
of the balance sheet dates, the estimated fair values of the financial instruments were not materially different from their carrying
values as presented on the balance sheet. This is primarily attributed to the short maturities of these instruments. 

Effective
July 1, 2008, the Company adopted ASC 820 (previously SFAS 157), Fair Value Measurements and adopted this Statement for the assets
and liabilities shown in the table below. ASC 820 clarifies the definition of fair value, prescribes methods for measuring fair value,
establishes a fair value hierarchy based on the inputs used to measure fair value, and expands disclosures about the use of fair value
measurements. The adoption of ASC 820 did not have a material impact on our fair value measurements. ASC 820 permits the Company to defer
the recognition and measurement of the nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities until January 1, 2010. At June 30, 2021, the
Company did not have any nonfinancial assets or nonfinancial liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value. ASC 820 requires
that financial assets and liabilities that are reported at fair value be categorized as one of the types of investments based upon the
methodology mentioned in Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3 above for determining fair value. 

Assets
measured at fair value on a recurring basis are summarized below. The Company also has convertible notes and derivative liabilities as
disclosed in this report that are measured at fair value on a regular basis until paid off or exercised. 

The
Company uses various approaches to measure fair value of available-for-sale securities, while applying the three-level valuation hierarchy
for disclosures, specified in ASC 820. Our Level 1 securities were measured using the quoted prices in active markets for identical assets
and liabilities. 

The
company s policy regarding the transfers in and/or out of Level 3 depends on the trading activity of the security, the volatility
of the security, and other observable units which clearly represents the fair value of the security. If a level 3 security can be measured
using a more fairly represented fair value, we will transfer these securities either into Level 1 or Level 2, depending on the type of
inputs. 

REVENUE
RECOGNITION STANDARDS 

ASC
606-10 provides the following overview of how revenue is recognized from an entity s contracts with customers: An entity recognizes
revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity
expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. 

Step
1: Identify the contract(s) with a customer. 

Step
2: Identify the performance obligations in the contract. 

Step
3: Determine the transaction price The transaction price is the amount of consideration in a contract to which an entity expects
to be entitled in exchange for transferring promised goods or services to a customer. 

Step
4: Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract Any entity typically allocates the transaction
price to each performance obligation on the basis of the relative standalone selling prices of each distinct good or service promised
in the contract. 

F- 10 

Step
5: Recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation An entity recognizes revenue when (or as) it
satisfies a performance obligation by transferring a promised good or service to a customer (which is when the customer obtains control
of that good or service). 

The
amount of revenue recognized is the amount allocated to the satisfied performance obligation. A performance obligation may be satisfied
at a point in time (typically for promises to transfer goods to a customer) or over time (typically for promises to transfer service
to a customer). For performance obligations satisfied over time, an entity recognizes revenue over time by selecting an appropriate method
for measuring the entity s progress toward complete satisfaction of that performance obligation. (Paragraphs 606-10 25-23 through
25-30). 

In
addition, ASC 606-10 contains guidance on the disclosures related to revenue, and notes the following: 

It
also includes a cohesive set of disclosure requirements that would result in an entity providing users of financial statements with comprehensive
information about the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from the entity s contracts with
customers. Specifically, Section 606-10-50 requires an entity to provide information about: 

-
Revenue recognized from contracts with customers, including disaggregation of revenue into appropriate categories. 

-
Contract balances, including the opening and closing balances of receivables, contract assets, and contract liabilities. 

-
Performance obligations, including when the entity typically satisfies its performance obligations and the transaction prices is that
is allocated to the remaining performance obligations in a contract. 

-
Significant judgments, and changes in judgments, made in applying the requirements to those contracts. 

Additionally,
Section 340-40-50 requires an entity to provide quantitative and/or qualitative information about assets recognized from the costs to
obtain or fulfill a contract with a customer. 

The
Company s revenue recognition policies are in compliance with ASC 606-10. The Company recognizes consulting and advisory fee revenues
in accordance with the above-mentioned guidelines and expenses are recognized in the period in which the corresponding liability is incurred. 

ADVERTISING 

The
Company expenses advertising costs as incurred. Advertising costs for the years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020 were 0 and 50,377, respectively.
The Company did not incur any advertising and investor relations expenses during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021. 

COMPREHENSIVE
INCOME (LOSS) 

ASC
220-10-45 (previously SFAS 130, Reporting Comprehensive Income) establishes standards for reporting and display of comprehensive income,
its components and accumulated balances. Comprehensive income is defined to include all changes in equity, except those resulting from
investments by owners and distributions to owners. Among other disclosures, SFAS No. 130 requires that all items that are required to
be recognized under current accounting standards as components of comprehensive income be reported in a financial statement that is displayed
with the same prominence as other financial statements. As of June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively, accumulated other comprehensive income
(loss) of 266,890 and 135,301 are presented on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. 

F- 11 

INCOME
TAXES 

The
Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with ASC 740 (previously SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes ). Deferred
taxes are provided on the liability method whereby deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences, and deferred
tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences. Temporary differences are the differences between the reported amounts
of assets and liabilities and their tax bases. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management,
it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities
are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment. 

REPORTING
OF SEGMENTS 

ASC
280 (previously Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 131, Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information),
which supersedes Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 14, Financial Reporting for Segments of a Business Enterprise, establishes
standards for the way that public enterprises report information about operating segments in annual financial statements and requires
reporting of selected information about operating segments in interim financial statements regarding products and services, geographic
areas and major customers. ASC 280 defines operating segments as components of an enterprise about which separate financial information
is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing
performance. The Company operated in one revenue-generating segment during the years ended June 30, 2021 and June 30, 2020. 

RISKS
AND UNCERTAINTIES 

In
the normal course of business, the Company is subject to certain risks and uncertainties. The Company provides its service and receives
marketable securities upon execution of transactions. Consequently, the value of the securities received from customers can be affected
by economic fluctuations and each customer s business growth. The actual realized value of these securities could be significantly
different than recorded value. 

RECENT
ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS 

In
August 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ASU 2020-06-Debt-Debt
with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging-Contracts in Entity s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40)-Accounting
For Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity s Own Equity. The ASU simplifies accounting for convertible instruments
by removing major separation models required under current GAAP. Consequently, more convertible debt instruments will be reported as
a single liability instrument with no separate accounting for embedded conversion features. The ASU removes certain settlement conditions
that are required for equity contracts to qualify for the derivative scope exception, which will permit more equity contracts to qualify
for it. The ASU also simplifies the diluted net income per share calculation in certain areas. The new guidance is effective for annual
and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2021, and early adoption is permitted for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
2020. The Company intends to adopt ASU 2020-06 for the quarter beginning January 1, 2022. 

Update
No. 2018-13 August 2018 

Fair
Value Measurement (Topic 820): Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement 

Modifications:
The following disclosure requirements were modified in Topic 820: 

1.
In lieu of a rollforward for Level 3 fair value measurements, a nonpublic entity is required to disclose transfers into and out of Level
3 of the fair value hierarchy and purchases and issues of Level 3 assets and liabilities. 

2.
For investments in certain entities that calculate net asset value, an entity is required to disclose the timing of liquidation of an
investee s assets and the date when restrictions from redemption might lapse only if the investee has communicated the timing to
the entity or announced the timing publicly. 

F- 12 

3.
The amendments clarify that the measurement uncertainty disclosure is to communicate information about the uncertainty in measurement
as of the reporting date. 

Additions:
The following disclosure requirements were added to Topic 820; however, the disclosures are not required for nonpublic entities: 

1.
The changes in unrealized gains and losses for the period included in other comprehensive income for recurring Level 3 fair value measurements
held at the end of the reporting period. 

2.
The range and weighted average of significant unobservable inputs used to develop Level 3 fair value measurements. For certain unobservable
inputs, an entity may disclose other quantitative information (such as the median or arithmetic average) in lieu of the weighted average
if the entity determines that other quantitative information would be a more reasonable and rational method to reflect the distribution
of unobservable inputs used to develop Level 3 fair value measurements. 

The
amendments in this Update are effective for all entities for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after
December 15, 2019. 

Update
No. 2018-07 June 2018 

Compensation
 Stock Compensation (Topic 718) 

Improvements
to Nonemployee Share-Based Payment Accounting 

Main
Provisions: The amendments in this Update expand the scope of Topic 718 to include share-based payment transactions for acquiring goods
and services from nonemployees. An entity should apply the requirements of Topic 718 to nonemployee awards except for specific guidance
on inputs to an option pricing model and the attribution of cost (that is, the period of time over which share-based payment awards vest
and the pattern of cost recognition over that period). The amendments specify that Topic 718 applies to all share-based payment transactions
in which a grantor acquires goods or services to be used or consumed in a grantor s own operations by issuing share-based payment
awards. The amendments also clarify that Topic 718 does not apply to share-based payments used to effectively provide (1) financing to
the issuer or (2) awards granted in conjunction with selling goods or services to customers as part of a contract accounted for under
Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. 

The
amendments in this Update are effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim
periods within that fiscal year.

606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, and No. 2016-02. 

The
transition provisions in ASC Topic 606 require that a public business entity and certain other specified entities adopt ASC Topic 606
for annual reporting 3 periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. FN2
All other entities are required to adopt ASC Topic 606 for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim reporting
periods within annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019. 

F- 13 

Update
No. 2016-10 - April 2016 

Revenue
from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing 

The
core principle of the guidance in Topic 606 is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services
to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.
To achieve that core principle, an entity should apply the following steps: 

1.
Identify the contract(s) with a customer. 

 2.
Identify the performance obligations in the contract. 

 3.
Determine the transaction price. 

 4.
Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract. 

 5.
Recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. 

The
amendments in this Update do not change the core principle of the guidance in Topic 606. Rather, the amendments in this Update clarify
the following two aspects of Topic 606: identifying performance obligations and the licensing implementation guidance, while retaining
the related principles for those areas. 

The
Company has either evaluated or is currently evaluating the implications, if any, of each of these pronouncements and the possible impact
they may have on the Company s financial statements. In most cases, management has determined that the implementation of these
pronouncements would not have a material impact on the financial statements taken as a whole. 

NOTE
3 OTHER CURRENT ASSETS 

The
Company s marketable securities are classified as available-for-sale and, as such, are carried at fair value. All of the securities

in the SEC s rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including its principal executive
officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based upon their evaluation,
our management (including our Chief Executive Officer) concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of
June 30, 2021, based on the material weaknesses defined below.

Internal
Control over Financial Reporting 

Management s
Annual Report on Internal Control of Financial Reporting 

Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over
financial reporting is a set of processes designed by, or under the supervision of, a company s principal executive and principal
financial officers, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP and includes those policies and procedures that: 

pertain
 to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect our transactions and dispositions of our assets, 

provide
 reasonable assurance that our transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of our financial statements in accordance
 with GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors,
 and 

provide
 reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of authorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could
 have a material effect on our financial statements. 

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. It should be noted that
any system of internal control, however well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, and not absolute, assurance that the
objectives of the system will be met. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk
that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures
may deteriorate. 

Under
the supervision and with the participation of management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer,
the Company s management assessed the design and operating effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of June
30, 2021 based on the framework set forth in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission. 

We
have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. 

If
we fail to develop and maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately report
our financial results in a timely manner, which may adversely affect investor confidence in our company. 

The
material weaknesses related to a lack of a full segregation of duties and to our lack of sufficient personnel in our accounting and financial
reporting functions with sufficient experience and expertise with respect to the application of U.S. GAAP and related financial reporting. 

Based
on this assessment, management concluded that the Company s internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of June
30, 2021. 

Management s
Remediation Plan 

We
plan to take steps to enhance and improve the design of our internal control over financial reporting. During the period covered by this
annual report on Form 10-K, we have not been able to remediate the material weaknesses identified above. To remediate such weaknesses,
we plan to implement the following changes in the future: 

(i) 
 appoint
 additional qualified personnel to address inadequate segregation of duties and ineffective risk management; and 

(ii) 
 adopt
 sufficient written policies and procedures for accounting and financial reporting. 

The
remediation efforts set out in (i) are largely dependent upon our company securing additional financing to cover the costs of implementing
the changes required. If we are unsuccessful in securing such funds, remediation efforts may be adversely affected in a material manner.
Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control
issues, if any, within our company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making
can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. 

18 

Management
believes that despite our material weaknesses set forth above, our consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended June 30,
2021 are fairly stated, in all material respects, in accordance with US GAAP. 

Attestation
Report of the Registered Accounting Firm 

This
Annual Report does not include an attestation report of the Company s independent registered public accounting firm regarding internal
control over financial reporting. Management s report was not subject to attestation by the Company s independent registered
public accounting firm pursuant to Rule 308(b) of Regulation S-K, which permits the Company to provide only management s report
in this Annual Report. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

No
changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting have come to management s attention during the Company s
last fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial
reporting.
