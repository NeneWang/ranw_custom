PART
I 

ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

Overview 

We were incorporated under the laws of the State of
Delaware, August 18, 1992. Prior to the Acquisition (as defined below), we were a shell company (as such term is defined
in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended). As a result of the Acquisition, we have ceased to be a shell
company and will continue as a publicly traded company under the name StemGen, Inc. The existing business operations of D3esports,
Inc. will continue as our wholly-owned subsidiary. 

On January 29, 2019 (the Closing Date ),
we completed and closed the acquisition (the Acquisition under an Agreement and Plan of Reorganization (the Reorganization
Agreement ), entered into by and among (i) StemGen, Inc.( StemGen ); (ii) D3esports, Inc., a Wyoming corporation D3esports );
and (iii) the shareholders of D3esports Sellers pursuant to which D3esports became a wholly owned subsidiary of ours.
Pursuant to the Reorganization Agreement, we acquired from the Sellers all of the issued and outstanding equity interests of D3esports
in exchange for 39,631,587 shares of our common stock, par value 0.001 per share and 6,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock, par value 0.001
per share. As a result of the Acquisition, the Sellers, as the former shareholders of D3esports, became the controlling shareholders of
the Company. The Acquisition was accounted for as a reverse merger notwithstanding it is legally a reverse acquisition. For accounting
purposes, D3esports is the acquiring entity. Current and comparative consolidated financial statements include the accounts of D3esports
since inception (May 1, 2018) and StemGen from the date of acquisition (January 29, 2019) (collectively, the Company ).

Background of our Company 

We were incorporated under the laws of the State of
Delaware, August 18, 1992. Prior to the Acquisition (as defined below), we were a shell company (as such term is defined
in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended). As a result of the Acquisition, we have ceased to be a shell
company and will continue as a publicly traded company under the name StemGen, Inc. The existing business operations of D3esports,
Inc. will continue as our wholly-owned subsidiary. 

On January 29, 2019 (the Closing Date ),
we completed and closed the acquisition (the Acquisition under an Agreement and Plan of Reorganization (the Reorganization
Agreement ), entered into by and among by and among (i) StemGen, Inc.( StemGen ); (ii) D3esports, Inc., a Wyoming corporation D3esports ); (ii) and the shareholders of D3esports Sellers pursuant to which D3esports became a wholly
owned subsidiary of ours. Pursuant to the Reorganization Agreement, we acquired from the Sellers all of the issued and outstanding equity
interests of D3esports in exchange for 39,631,587 shares of our common stock, par value 0.001 per share and 6,000,000 shares of Preferred
Stock, par value 0.001 per share. As a result of the Acquisition, the Sellers, as the former shareholders of D3esports, became the controlling
shareholders of the Company. The Acquisition was accounted for as a reverse merger notwithstanding it is legally a reverse acquisition.
For accounting purposes, D3esports is the acquiring entity. Current and comparative consolidated financial statements include the accounts
of D3esports since inception (May 1, 2018) and StemGen from the date of acquisition (January 29, 2019) (collectively, the Company ). 

D3esports was formed on May 1, 2018 and is based in
Angleton, TX. D3esports plans to hold monthly time trial format competitions through an eSports platform that allows professional race
car drivers and eSport athletes (gamer enthusiasts) to compete for a real experience in a race car and points that can be used to purchase
products and services through our partners. 

Plan of Operations 

Overview . Our plan of operation is the business plan of D3esports. D3esports intends
to gain year-round visibility by using a reputable eSport events company with knowledge in the traditional sports and global education
space to host ongoing virtual racing for corporate mentors and competitions with the top driver(s) at the end of the season earning the
opportunity to compete against professional drivers and a chance to drive a real race car. 

Our primary operation is to be the community offering
and management of our online competitions in the motorsports arena but not confined to just one sport. We plan to expand to other sports
in the future. The USP for D3esports is the Virtual to Real experience. We are negotiating agreements with third-party providers
to manage our competition and Microsoft, currently the sole platform of competition to which we also plan to expand into other. 

With growing partnerships from component providers
in the gaming and eSport space we plan to build and sell professional simulators linking to a points/rewards platform. 

Sales and Marketing . Our Marketing is through
monthly press releases and social media on Facebook and Instagram coupled with our 24/7 time trial competition with online advertising
for sponsors. 

Research and Development . We do not currently
develop electronic games. We are focused on forming agreements with the best games and virtual racing platforms in the world to optimize
the experience but to familiarize the competitor. We are building the ultimate experience to our offering which is a connection
to real drivers, engineers our partners technology by hosting eSports tournaments to connect the virtual to real and for the fastest
to have the opportunity to passenger or drive a real race car on a real track. Through our partnership and internal research we
are molding our competition to the gamer (gamer focused). We are negotiating contracts for competition management with third-party
providers and licensing agreements with Microsoft to run with Xbox and Forza 7 Motorsport to add to our intellectual properties. Additionally,
we are in talks with app developers for ease of competition registration and entry. 

Intellectual Property . We are negotiating
agreements with third-party providers to offer the best experience from green to checkered flag. There shall be more agreements
with component supplies for our Professional simulator and race team in the future. 

Competition . The business of eSports is highly competitive and rapidly growing. Our
ability to compete depends upon many factors within and outside our control, including the timely development and introduction of the
racing competition which is based on a time-trial format played 24/7 with the Forza 7 Motorsports, played on Xbox and PC. 

- 7 - 

As we expand and add more motorsports platforms (partnerships) and sports
to D3esports we will publish and market results, and the related enhancements, functionality, performance, reliability, customer service
and support and marketing efforts. Due to the relatively low barriers to entry in the eSports market, we expect additional competition
from other emerging companies but we have structured a virtual to real offering which can be added to professional team, sim centre and
other games companies, we are simply offering a path to pro and enhance the gamers experience to relate to the real world through virtual
competition. Many of our existing and potential competitors are substantially larger than us and have significantly greater financial,
technical and marketing resources that will compete for available users, developers and talent. With our partnerships, a large number
of competitors are in house. As a result, they may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer
requirements, or to devote greater resources to the publishing and promotion of their eSports competitions. There can be no assurance
that we will be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors or that competitive pressure will not have a material
adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. We have taken our time to see what competitors are producing
and letting them launch before us, so they are committed to a path. As they are larger companies their ability to change direction
is not as fast as us with a tighter, smaller group. 

We believe we do not have adequate funds to fully
execute the D3esports business plan for the next twelve months unless we obtain additional funding. However, should we not raise this
capital, we will allocate our funding to first assure that all state, federal and SEC requirements are met. 

As of June 30, 2021, we had cash on hand of 1,343. 

We intend to pursue capital through public or private
financing, as well as borrowing and other sources in order to finance our business activities. We cannot guarantee that additional funding
will be available on favorable terms, if at all. If adequate funds are not available, then our ability to continue our operations may
be significantly hindered. 

Results of Operations 

For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021, the Company
had a net loss of 433,143 and negative cash flow from operations of 141,196. As of June 30, 2021, the Company has negative working capital
of 1,734,314. 

We continue to rely on advances from shareholders
to fund operating shortfalls and do not foresee a change in this situation in the immediate future. There can be no assurance that we
will continue to have such advances available. We will not be able to continue operations without them. We are pursuing alternate sources
of financing, but there is no assurance that additional capital will be available to the Company when needed or on acceptable terms. 

Fiscal year ended June 30, 2021 compared to the
year ended June 30, 2020 

Revenue 

For the year ended June 30, 2021, we recognized revenue
of 39,000 compared to 19,350 for the comparable period of 2020. The Company is continuing to try to build a steady and predicable revenue
stream. 

Cost of Revenue 

For the year ended June 30, 2021, we recognized costs
of revenue of 30,454 compared to 8,572 for the comparable period of 2020. 

General and Administrative Expenses 

We recognized general and administrative expenses
of 139,993 and 58,475 for the year ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The increase in general and administrative expense was
primarily the result of increased consulting, and advertising and marketing expenses. 

Depreciation 

We recognized depreciation of 112,477 and 19,373
during the years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020 related to placing our race cars in service. 

- 8 - 

Interest Expense 

We recognized interest expense 140,800 and 140,800
for the year ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Interest expense represents the stated interest on the outstanding convertible
notes payable. 

Change in Fair Value of Derivative Instruments 

Change in fair value of derivative instruments was a loss of 22,919 and
 22,902 for the year ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively, as a result of increased accrued interest. 

Net Loss 

We incurred a net loss of 433,143 for the year ended
June 30, 2021 as compared to a net loss of 230,772 for the year ended June 30, 2020. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

We anticipate needing approximately of 425,000 to
fund our operations and to effectively execute our business plan over the next eighteen months. Currently available cash is not sufficient
to allow us to commence full execution of our business plan. Our business expansion will require significant capital resources that may
be funded through the issuance of common stock or of notes payable or other debt arrangements that may affect our debt structure. Despite
our current financial status, we believe that we may be able to issue notes payable or debt instruments in order to start executing our
business plan. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to raise money in this fashion and have not entered into any agreements
that would obligate a third party to provide us with capital. 

We raised the cash amounts to be used in these activities
from the sale of common stock and from advances. We currently have negative working capital of 1,734,314. 

As of June 30, 2021, we had cash on hand of 1,343.
We do not have an adequate amount of cash on hand to fund our future operations. 

We have no known demands or commitments and are not
aware of any events or uncertainties as of June 30, 2021 that will result in or that are reasonably likely to materially increase or decrease
our current liquidity. 

Capital Resources 

We had no material commitments for capital expenditures
as of June 30, 2021. However, should we execute our business plan as anticipated, we would incur substantial capital expenditures and
require financing in addition to what is required to fund our present operation. 

Additional Financing 

Additional financing is required to continue operations.
Although actively searching for available capital, the Company does not have any current arrangements for additional outside sources of
financing and cannot provide any assurance that such financing will be available. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements
that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues
or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 

We prepare our financial statements in conformity
with GAAP, which requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions and apply judgments. We base our estimates and judgments
on historical experience, current trends, and other factors that management believes to be important at the time the financial statements
are prepared; actual results could differ from our estimates and such differences could be material. We have identified below the critical
accounting policies, which are assumptions made by management about matters that are highly uncertain and that are of critical importance
in the presentation of our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Due to the need to make estimates about the effect
of matters that are inherently uncertain, materially different amounts could be reported under different conditions or using different
assumptions. On a regular basis, we review our critical accounting policies and how they are applied in the preparation our financial
statements. 

USE OF ESTIMATES - The preparation of financial statements
in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date
of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ
from those estimates. 

GOING CONCERN - The accompanying financial statements
have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. For the year ended June 30, 2021, the Company had a net
loss of 433,143 and we had negative cash flow from operations of 141,196. In view of these matters, the Company s ability to continue
as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to achieve a level of profitability or to obtain additional capital to finance its operations.
The Company intends on financing its future activities and its working capital needs largely from the sale of public equity securities
with some additional funding from other traditional financing sources, including term notes until such time that funds provided by operations
are sufficient to fund working capital requirements. The financial statements of the Company do not include any adjustments relating to
the recoverability and classification of recorded assets, or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that might be necessary should
the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. 

Derivative Instruments 

Our debt or equity instruments may contain embedded
derivative instruments, such as conversion options, which in certain circumstances may be required to be bifurcated from the associated
host instrument and accounted for separately as a derivative instrument liability. 

Our derivative instrument liabilities are re-valued
at the end of each reporting period, with changes in the fair value of the derivative liability recorded as charges or credits to income,
in the period in which the changes occur. For bifurcated conversion options that are accounted for as derivative instrument liabilities,
we determine the fair value of these instruments using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. This model requires assumptions related
to the remaining term of the instrument and risk-free rates of return, our current Common Stock price and expected dividend yield, and
the expected volatility of our Common Stock price over the life of the option.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING
FIRM 

To the Board of Directors and 

 Shareholders of StemGen, Inc. 

Opinion on the Financial Statements 

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of StemGen,
Inc. (the Company) as of June 30, 2021 and 2020, and the related consolidated statements of operations, shareholders deficit, and
cash flows for the each of the two years then ended, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements).
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company
as of June 30, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the two years ended June 30, 2021, in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 

Basis for Opinion 

These financial statements are the responsibility
of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our
audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are
required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and
regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards
of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform,
an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal
control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal
control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our audits included performing procedures to assess
the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond
to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating
the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

Going Concern Matter 

The accompanying consolidated financial statements
have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, the
Company has suffered recurring losses from operations and has a net capital deficiency that raises substantial doubt about its ability
to continue as a going concern. Management s plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 2. The financial statements
do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

Critical Audit Matters 

Critical audit matters arising from the current period audit of the financial
statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures
that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. We determined
that there are no critical audit matters. 

/s/PWR CPA, LLP 

We have served as the Company s auditor since
2020.

STEMGEN, INC. 

 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

 June 30, 2021 

NOTE 1 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING
POLICIES 

Nature of Business We were incorporated
under the laws of the State of Delaware, August 18, 1992. Prior to the Acquisition (as defined below), we were a shell company 
(as such term is defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended). As a result of the Acquisition, we have
ceased to be a shell company and will continue as a publicly traded company under the name StemGen, Inc. The existing business
operations of D3esports, Inc. will continue as our wholly-owned subsidiary. 

On January 29, 2019 (the Closing Date ),
we completed and closed the acquisition (the Acquisition under an Agreement and Plan of Reorganization (the Reorganization
Agreement ), entered into by and among by and among (i) StemGen, Inc.( StemGen ); (ii) D3esports, Inc., a Wyoming corporation D3esports ); (ii) and the shareholders of D3esports Sellers pursuant to which D3esports became a wholly
owned subsidiary of ours. Pursuant to the Reorganization Agreement, we acquired from the Sellers all of the issued and outstanding equity
interests of D3esports in exchange for 39,631,587 shares of our common stock, par value 0.001 per share and 6,000,000 shares of Preferred
Stock, par value 0.001 per share. As a result of the Acquisition, the Sellers, as the former shareholders of D3esports, became the controlling
shareholders of the Company. The Acquisition was accounted for as a reverse merger notwithstanding it is legally a reverse acquisition.
For accounting purposes, D3esports is the acquiring entity. Current and comparative consolidated financial statements include the accounts
of D3esports since inception (May 1, 2018) and StemGen from the date of acquisition (January 29, 2019) (collectively, the Company ). 

D3esports was formed on May 1, 2018 and is based in
Angleton, TX. D3esports plans to hold monthly time trial format competitions through an eSports platform that allows professional race
car drivers and eSport athletes (gamer enthusiasts) to compete for a real experience in a race car and points that can be used to purchase
products and services through our partners. 

Principles of Consolidation 
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of StemGen, and its subsidiaries, which are majority owned by StemGen.
All significant inter-company transactions and balances have been eliminated. 

Use of Estimates The preparation of
financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States GAAP requires management
to make estimates and assumptions that affect certain reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Management believes that these estimates and assumptions provide
a reasonable basis for the fair presentation of the financial statements. 

Cash and Cash Equivalents The Company
considers all highly liquid debt instruments with an original maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. 

Property and Equipment Property and
equipment consists of vehicles and website design. The vehicles are three race cars which were contributed as capital at the inception
of the Company and recorded at their estimated fair value. Depreciation on the race cars is recognized on a straight-line basis
over seven years. 

Improvements or betterments of a permanent nature
are capitalized. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. The cost of assets retired or
otherwise disposed of and the related accumulated depreciation are eliminated from the accounts in the year of disposal. Gains or
losses resulting from property disposals are credited or charged to operations in the year of disposal. 

Revenue Recognition The Company
recognizes revenue in accordance with ASC Topic 606 whereby revenue is recognized primarily on the date products are delivered to
the customer or services are provided. Payments for products or services which have been received prior to the Company fulfilling
its performance obligations are deferred until those obligations are satisfied. Costs related to deferred revenue are included in
contract assets until the revenue is recognized. 

Income Taxes The Company accounts for
income taxes under FASB Codification Topic 740-10-25 ASC 740-10-25 ). Under ASC 740-10-25, deferred tax assets and liabilities
are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing
assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected
to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Under ASC 740-10-25,
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment
date. 

- 17 - 

Earnings (Loss) per Common Share The
Company computes basic and diluted earnings per common share amounts in accordance with ASC Topic 260, Earnings per Share .
The basic earnings (loss) per common share are calculated by dividing the Company s net income available to common shareholders
by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the year. The diluted earnings (loss) per common share are calculated
by dividing the Company s net income (loss) available to common shareholders by the diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding
during the year. The diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding is the basic weighted number of shares adjusted as of the first
of the year for any potentially dilutive debt or equity. As of June 30, 2021, there were 33,107,010 potentially dilutive shares related
to convertible debt, accrued interest and Series A Preferred Stock. 

Derivative Instruments Our debt or
equity instruments may contain embedded derivative instruments, such as conversion options, which in certain circumstances may be required
to be bifurcated from the associated host instrument and accounted for separately as a derivative instrument liability. 

Our derivative liability is re-valued at the end of each reporting period,
with changes in the fair value of the derivative liability recorded as charges or credits to income, in the period in which the changes
occur. For bifurcated conversion options that are accounted for as derivative instrument liabilities, we determine the fair value of these
instruments using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. This model requires assumptions related to the remaining term of the instrument
and risk-free rates of return, our current Common Stock price and expected dividend yield, and the expected volatility of our Common Stock
price over the life of the option. 

Financial Instruments The Company s
balance sheet includes certain financial instruments. The carrying amounts of current assets and current liabilities approximate their
fair value because of the relatively short period between the origination of these instruments and their expected realization. 

FASB ASC 820 Fair
Value Measurements and Disclosures defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or
paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction
between market participants on the measurement date. ASC 820 also establishes a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between (1) market
participant assumptions developed based on market data obtained from independent sources (observable inputs) and (2) an entity s
own assumptions about market participant assumptions developed based on the best information available in the circumstances (unobservable
inputs). The fair value hierarchy consists of three broad levels, which gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active
markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3). The three levels of the
fair value hierarchy are described below: 

Level 1 - 
 Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities. 

Level 2 - 
 Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, including quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability (e.g., interest rates); and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means. 

Level 3 - 
 Inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable. 

Fair value estimates discussed herein are based upon
certain market assumptions and pertinent information available to management as of June 30, 2021 and 2020. The respective carrying value
of certain on-balance-sheet financial instruments approximated their fair values due to the short-term nature of these instruments. These
financial instruments include accounts payable, and accrued expenses. The fair value of the Company s notes payable is estimated
based on current rates that would be available for debt of similar terms that is not significantly different from its stated value. 

- 18 - 

COVID-19 Since March 31, 2020 and
through the date of this report, the entire global economy has been substantially impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic which began in
China and has spread to the United States and most other parts of the world. The impacts on the Company s business from the
COVID-19 pandemic include the following factors: 

A negative impact due to the contraction in the sources of capital required to support our continued business strategic efforts. 

A negative impact due to rising bottleneck in the supply chain of goods and services needed to pursue our business strategic effort. 

A negative impact on our human capital resources needed in our business. 

NOTE 2 GOING CONCERN 

The accompanying consolidated financial statements
have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. For the year ended June 30, 2021, the Company had a net
loss of 433,143. As of June 30, 2021, the Company had negative working capital of 1,734,314. Management does not anticipate having positive
cash flow from operations in the near future. 

These factors raise a substantial doubt about the
Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect
the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that
may result from the possible inability of the Company to continue as a going concern. 

The Company does not have the resources at this time
to repay its credit and debt obligations, make any payments in the form of dividends to its shareholders or fully implement its business
plan. Without additional capital, the Company will not be able to remain in business. 

Management has plans to address the Company s
financial situation as follows: 

In the near term, management plans to continue to
focus on increasing revenues and raising the funds necessary to fully implement the Company s business plan. Management will continue
to seek out debt financing to obtain the capital required to meet the Company s financial obligations. There is no assurance, however,
that lenders will continue to advance capital to the Company or that the new business operations will be profitable. The possibility of
failure in obtaining additional funding and the potential inability to achieve profitability raise doubts about the Company s ability
to continue as a going concern. 

In the long term, management believes that the Company s
projects and initiatives will be successful and will provide cash flow to the Company, which will be used to finance the Company s
future growth. However, there can be no assurances that the Company s planned activities will be successful, or that the Company
will ultimately attain profitability. The Company s long-term viability depends on its ability to obtain adequate sources of debt
or equity funding to meet current commitments and fund the continuation of its business operations, and the ability of the Company to
achieve adequate profitability and cash flows from operations to sustain its operations. 

NOTE 3 COMMITMENTS 

From time to time, we may be involved in litigation
in the ordinary course of business. To our knowledge, there is no action, suit, proceeding, inquiry or investigation before or by any
court, public board, government agency, self-regulatory organization or body pending or, to the knowledge of our executive officers or
any of our subsidiaries, threatened against or affecting our Company, our common stock, any of our subsidiaries or any of our subsidiaries 
officers or directors in their capacities as such, in which an adverse decision could have a material adverse effect. 

- 19 - 

NOTE 4 EQUITY 

During the year ended June 30, 2021, the Company issued
240,875 shares of common stock for the purchase of two race cars. The stock was valued at 192,700 based on the market value of the stock
on the date of the transaction. 

During the year ended June 30, 2020, the Company issued
7,000 shares of common stock and received cash proceeds of 7,000. 

There are 8,000,000 shares of preferred stock authorized.

The Series A Convertible Preferred Stock has a par
value of 0.001 and the number of shares constituting such class shall be unlimited. As of June 30, 2021, the Company has 6,000,000 shares
of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock issued and outstanding. The Series A Convertible Preferred Stock has priority in liquidation and
has a liquidation preference of 1 per share. The Series A Preferred Stock is convertible into shares of common stock at the option of
the holder at a rate of three shares of common stock for each share of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock. The Series A Convertible
Preferred Stockholders are not entitled to receive dividends and have no voting rights. The Series A Convertible Preferred Stock is redeemable
by the Company at any time at 1 per share. 

The Company has also authorized 1,000,000 shares of
Series E Preferred Stock issued and outstanding. The Series E Preferred Stock has a par value of 0.000001 and ranks junior to all
the Company s common and other preferred stock. There are no dividends on the Series E Preferred Stock and there is no participation
in liquidation, dissolution or winding-up distribution of the assets of the Company. The shares of outstanding Series E Preferred
Stock shall have the right to vote based on the number of votes equal to twice the number of votes of all outstanding shares of capital
stock. 

The Company has authorized 1,000,000 shares of Series
F Preferred Stock. The Series F Preferred Stock has a par value of 0.000001 per share and ranks junior to all of the Company s
common and other preferred stock. There are no dividends on the Series F Preferred Stock and there is no participation in liquidation,
dissolution or winding-up distribution of the assets of the Company. The shares of outstanding Series F Preferred Stock shall have the
right to vote based on the number of votes equal to twice the number of votes of all outstanding shares of capital stock such that the
holders of the outstanding shares of Series F Preferred Stock shall always constitute sixty-six and two thirds of the voting rights of
the Company. The voting rights of the Series F Preferred Stock are superior to the voting rights of the Series E Preferred Stock. 

NOTE 5 INCOME TAXES 

The deferred tax asset as of June 30, 2021 and
2020 was approximately 598,000 and 507,000, respectively, offset by valuation allowances of the same amount resulting in a
deferred tax asset of 0 at both June 30, 2021 and 2020. There is no income tax provision for the years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020
due to the change in the valuation allowance. The difference between the effective rate and the statutory rate is the result of the
change in the valuation allowance. At June 30, 2021 the Company had an unused net operating loss carry over approximating
 2,848,000, that is potentially available to offset future taxable income, which expires beginning 2028. 

The Company has not filed its Federal tax
returns for 2009 through 2021 and could be subject to penalty for its delinquency. Additionally, the availability of its net
operating loss may be subject to adjustment or restriction due to the change in control of the Company during 2019.

36,340 

Convertible note in the original principal amount of 85,465, issued June 30, 2015 and maturing June 30, 2017, bearing interest at 10 per year until maturity and 25 thereafter, and convertible into common stock at a rate of 0.05 per share. 

85,465

61,118 

Total convertible notes 

563,203 

All principal along with accrued interest is
payable on the maturity date. The notes are convertible into common stock at the option of the holder. The holder of the notes
cannot convert the notes into shares of common stock if that conversion would result in the holder owning more than 4.9 of the
outstanding stock of the Company. The notes are unsecured and are in default. As of June 30, 2021, there was 570,229 of
accrued interest related to these notes. For both the years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, the Company recorded interest expense of
 140,800 and 140,800, respectively, related to these notes. 

NOTE 7 DERIVATIVE LIABILITY 

The conversion feature of certain convertible notes payable was accounted
for as a derivative liability. The derivative liability at June 30, 2021, was calculated using the Black Scholes method over the expected
terms of the convertible notes, with a risk free rate of .06 and volatility of 200 . 

Included in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations is a
loss arising from the change in fair value of the derivatives of 22,919 and 22,902 for the years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
As of June 30, 2021, the Company had a payable of 12,000 to Dawson Racing related to these expenses. 

NOTE 8 RELATED PARTY 

The Company has been provided warehouse and office space by an entity owned
by Simon Dawson for which 26,600 and 6,000 was expensed during the years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. As of June 30,
2021, the Company had a payable of 12,000 to Dawson Racing related to these expenses.

of 16,000 and 4,000, respectively, from Dawson Racing, an entity owned by Simon and Ian Dawson, for sponsorship. As of June 30, 2020,
the Company has deferred revenue of 16,000 related to sponsorship and accounts receivable of 10,000 from Dawson Racing. Dawson Racing

ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS
ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE 

Changes in Accounts 

None. 

Disagreements with Accountants 

There were no disagreements with accountants on accounting
and financial disclosures for the year ended June 30, 2021. 

ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

We carried out an evaluation, under the supervision
and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness
of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)). Based upon that evaluation, our
principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that, as of the end of the period covered in this report, our disclosure
controls and procedures were not effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports filed under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the required time periods and is accumulated and communicated to our
management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure. 

Limitations on Systems of Controls 

Our management, including our principal executive
officer and principal financial officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls will prevent
all error or fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance
that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource
constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Due to the inherent limitations in all control systems,
no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. To
address the material weaknesses identified in our evaluation, we performed additional analysis and other post-closing procedures in an
effort to ensure our financial statements included in this annual report have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles. Accordingly, management believes that the financial statements included in this report fairly present in all material respects
our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented. 

Management s Report on Internal Control over
Financial Reporting 

Our management is responsible for establishing and
maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rule 13a-15(f)
or 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company s
principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by the company s board of directors, management and other personnel,
to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and includes those policies and procedures
that: 

Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; 

Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and 

Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 

- 22 - 

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control
over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are
subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies
or procedures may deteriorate. All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those
systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.
Because of the inherent limitations of internal control, there is a risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or detected
on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting. However, these inherent limitations are known features of the financial
reporting process. Therefore, it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce, though not eliminate, this risk. 

As of June 30, 2021, management assessed the effectiveness
of our internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting established
in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO
2013 and SEC guidance on conducting such assessments. Based on that evaluation, they concluded that, during the period covered
by this report, such internal controls and procedures were not effective to detect the inappropriate application of US GAAP rules as more
fully described below. This was due to deficiencies that existed in the design or operation of our internal controls over financial reporting
that adversely affected our internal controls and that may be considered to be material weaknesses. 

The matters involving internal controls and procedures
that our management considered to be material weaknesses under the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board were: lack
of a functioning audit committee; lack of a majority of independent members and a lack of a majority of outside directors on our board
of directors; inadequate segregation of duties consistent with control objectives; and, management is dominated by a single individual.
The aforementioned material weaknesses were identified by our Chief Executive Officer in connection with the audit of our financial statements
as of June 30, 2021. 

Management believes that the material weaknesses set
forth above did not have an effect on our financial results. However, management believes that the lack of a functioning audit committee
and the lack of a majority of outside directors on our board of directors results in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring
of required internal controls and procedures, which could result in a material misstatement in our financial statements in future periods.

Biographies 

Simon Dawson joined his father on the Project Libra
Race program, which developed the Radical Ford Eco Boost race engine and its first race car in 2012. 

This led to his permanent move from North Carolina
to Houston to develop a full Radical dealership and track day business, which he runs with his father today. 

Over the last six years, Simon and his father have
enjoyed great success with Radical Texas selling track day cars, track day experiences and along the way, testing and developing the cars
and technologies that will bring them race championships well into the future. 

The driving force behind Simon s passion for
motorsports is family, and the dream of making racing an obtainable pastime and sport for all families and inspire the future linking
the real and virtual worlds with an investment into eSport for the ultimate experience.

Director Independence 

We are not currently subject to listing requirements
of any national securities exchange or inter-dealer quotation system which has requirements that a majority of the board of directors
be independent and, as a result, we are not at this time required to have our Board of Directors comprised of a majority
of independent directors. None of our directors are independent directors under the applicable standards of the SEC and
the NASDAQ stock market. 

Family Relationships 

There are no family relationships among our directors,
executive officers or persons nominated to become executive officers or directors. 

Involvement in Certain Legal Proceedings 

During the past ten (10) years, none of our directors,
persons nominated to become directors, executive officers, promoters or control persons was involved in any of the legal proceedings listen
in Item 401 (f) of Regulation S-K. 

Arrangements 

There are no arrangements or understandings between
an executive officer, director or nominee and any other person pursuant to which he was or is to be selected as an executive officer or
director. 

Committees of the Board of Directors 

Our sole director has not established any committees,
including an Audit Committee, a Compensation Committee, or a Nominating Committee, any committee performing a similar function. The functions
of those committees are being undertaken by our sole director. Because we do not have any independent directors, our sole director believes
that the establishment of committees of the Board would not provide any benefits to our company and could be considered more form than
substance. 

We do not have a policy regarding the consideration
of any director candidates that may be recommended by our stockholders, including the minimum qualifications for director candidates,
nor has our sole director established a process for identifying and evaluating director nominees. We have not adopted a policy regarding
the handling of any potential recommendation of director candidates by our stockholders, including the procedures to be followed. Our
sole director has not considered or adopted any of these policies, as we have never received a recommendation from any stockholder for
any candidate to serve on our Board of Directors. Given our relative size and lack of directors and officers insurance coverage, we do
not anticipate that any of our stockholders will make such a recommendation in the near future. 

While there have been no nominations of additional
directors proposed, in the event such a proposal is made, all current members of our Board will participate in the consideration of director
nominees. 

Our sole director is not an audit committee
financial expert within the meaning of Item 401(e) of Regulation S-K. In general, an audit committee financial expert 
is an individual member of the audit committee or Board of Directors who: 

understands generally accepted accounting principles and financial statements, 

is able to assess the general application of such principles in connection with accounting for estimates, accruals and reserves, 

has experience preparing, auditing, analyzing or evaluating financial statements comparable to the breadth and complexity to our financial statements, 

understands internal controls over financial reporting, and 

understands audit committee functions 

- 24 - 

Our Board of Directors is comprised of solely of Mr.
Dawson who is involved in our day-to-day operations. We would prefer to have an audit committee financial expert on our board of directors.
As with most small, early stage companies until such time our company further develops its business, achieves a stronger revenue base
and has sufficient working capital to purchase directors and officers insurance, the Company does not have any immediate prospects to
attract independent directors. When the Company is able to expand our Board of Directors to include one or more independent directors,
the Company intends to establish an Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. It is our intention that one or more of these independent
directors will also qualify as an audit committee financial expert. Our securities are not quoted on an exchange that has requirements
that a majority of our Board members be independent and the Company is not currently otherwise subject to any law, rule or regulation
requiring that all or any portion of our Board of Directors include independent directors, nor are we required to establish
or maintain an Audit Committee or other committee of our Board of Directors. 

WE DO NOT HAVE ANY INDEPENDENT DIRECTORS AND THE COMPANY
HAS NOT VOLUNTARILY IMPLEMENTED VARIOUS CORPORATE GOVERNANCE MEASURES, IN THE ABSENCE OF WHICH, STOCKHOLDERS MAY HAVE MORE LIMITED PROTECTIONS
AGAINST INTERESTED DIRECTOR TRANSACTIONS, CONFLICTS OF INTEREST, AND SIMILAR MATTERS.

Director Compensation 

Directors receive no compensation for serving on the
Board. We have no non-employee directors. 

Our Board of Directors is comprised of Simon Dawson.
Mr. Dawson also serves as the CEO of the Company. None of our directors has or had a compensation arrangement with the Company for director
services, nor have any of them been compensated for director services since the Company s inception. 

We reimburse our directors for all reasonable ordinary
and necessary business related expenses, but we did not pay director s fees or other cash compensation for services rendered as
a director in the year ended June 30, 2021 to any of the individuals serving on our Board during that period. We have no standard arrangement
pursuant to which our directors are compensated for their services in their capacity as directors. We may pay fees for services rendered
as a director when and if additional directors are appointed to the Board of Directors. 

Director Independence 

We do not currently have any independent directors
and we do not anticipate appointing additional directors in the foreseeable future. If we engage further directors and officers, however,
we plan to develop a definition of independence. 

ITEM 12. SECURITY OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL
OWNERS AND MANAGEMENT AND RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS 

We do not currently have a stock option plan in favor
of any director, officer, consultant, or employee of our company. No individual grants of stock options, whether or not in tandem with
stock appreciation rights known as SARs or freestanding SARs have been made to our sole director and officer since our inception; accordingly,
no stock options have been granted or exercised by our sole director and officer since we were founded. 

Beneficial ownership is determined in accordance with
the rules of the SEC and generally includes voting or investment power with respect to securities. In accordance with SEC rules, shares
of our common stock which may be acquired upon exercise of stock options or warrants which are currently exercisable or which become exercisable
within 60 days of the date of the applicable table below are deemed beneficially owned by the holders of such options and warrants and
are deemed outstanding for the purpose of computing the percentage of ownership of such person, but are not treated as outstanding for
the purpose of computing the percentage of ownership of any other person. Subject to community property laws, where applicable, the persons
or entities named in the tables below have sole voting and investment power with respect to all shares of our common stock indicated as
beneficially owned by them. 

The following table sets forth information with respect
to the beneficial ownership of our common stock as of June 30, 2021, by (i) each stockholder known by us to be the beneficial owner of
more than 5 of our common stock, voting preferred stock or convertible preferred stock, (ii) each of our directors and executive officers,
and (iii) all of our directors and executive officers as a group. To the best of our knowledge, except as otherwise indicated, each of
the persons named in the table has sole voting and investment power with respect to the shares of our stock beneficially owned by such
person, except to the extent such power may be shared with a spouse. To our knowledge, none of the shares listed below are held under
a voting trust or similar agreement, except as noted. Other than the Acquisition, to our knowledge, there is no arrangement, including
any pledge by any person of securities of the Company or any of its parents, the operation of which may at a subsequent date result in
a change in control of the Company.

 __________ 

 (1) Under
Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act, a beneficial owner of a security includes any person who, directly or indirectly, through any contract,
arrangement, understanding, relationship, or otherwise has or shares: (i) voting power, which includes the power to vote, or to direct
the voting of shares; and (ii) investment power, which includes the power to dispose or direct the disposition of shares. Certain shares
may be deemed to be beneficially owned by more than one person (if, for example, persons share the power to vote or the power to dispose
of the shares). In addition, shares are deemed to be beneficially owned by a person if the person has the right to acquire the shares
(for example, upon exercise of an option) within 60 days of the date as of which the information is provided. In computing the percentage
ownership of any person, the number of shares is deemed to include the number of shares beneficially owned by such person (and only such
person) by reason of these acquisition rights. As a result, the percentage of outstanding shares of any person as shown in this table
does not necessarily reflect the person s actual ownership or voting power with respect to the number of shares of common stock
outstanding on January 29, 2019. 

(2) In
addition to common stock, Landor Investment Corp. owns 1,000,000 shares of series E preferred stock. The Series E preferred stock has
a par value of 0.000001, does not vote because of the superior voting rights of the Series E Preferred Stock, ranks subordinate to the
Company s common stock and Series F Preferred Stock and is not entitled to participate in distributions of assets upon liquidation,
dissolution, or winding up of the Company, whether voluntary or involuntary. 

(3) Our
calculation of the percentage of beneficial ownership is based on 45,670,063 shares of common stock, 6,000,000 shares of Series A Preferred
Stock, 1,000,000 shares of Series E Preferred Stock and 1,000,000 shares of Series F Preferred Stock outstanding as of June 30, 2021. 

(4) Represents
Series E preferred stock 

- 27 - 

(5) Represents
Series A preferred stock, each convertible to 3 shares of common stock. The number of shares of the common stock held as of the date hereof
is 4.99 of the total outstanding because. all the convertible preferred stock are subject to a conversion cap of 4.99 of the total outstanding.
Therefore, the holder of the preferred stock does not have the right to hold more than the amount of the cap as expressed
by the Commission s amicus curiae brief in the case of Mark Levy v. Southbrook International Investments,
Ltd . (2 nd Cir. Mar 31, 2001). In addition to these shares, Lead Enterprises, Inc. holds several convertible
promissory notes which are convertible into a total of approximately 9,622,466 shares of common stock of the Company, all subject to the
4.99 limitation. 

(6) Robert
Wilson is the natural person who exercises the sole voting and or dispositive powers with respect to the shares of Recycled Capital Corp. 

(7) Robert
Sonfield is the natural person who exercises the sole voting and or dispositive powers with respect to the shares of Hampton Bay Trading
Corp. 

(8) Represents
Series F preferred stock
