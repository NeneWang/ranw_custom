PART I 

Item 1. BUSINESS 
 
 Overview 
 
 Northern Technologies International Corporation (NTIC) develops and markets proprietary, environmentally beneficial products and services in over 65 countries either directly or via a network of subsidiaries, joint ventures, independent distributors, and agents. NTIC s primary business is corrosion prevention marketed mainly under the ZERUST brand. NTIC has been selling its proprietary ZERUST products and services to the automotive, electronics, electrical, mechanical, military, and retail consumer markets for over 45 years and, in recent years, has targeted and expanded into the oil and gas industry. NTIC also markets and sells a portfolio of bio-based and certified compostable (fully biodegradable) polymer resin compounds and finished products under the Natur-Tec brand. These products are intended to reduce NTIC s customers carbon footprint and provide environmentally sound waste disposal options. 
 
 NTIC s ZERUST rust and corrosion inhibiting products include plastic and paper packaging, liquids, coatings, rust removers, cleaners, and diffusers as well as engineered solutions designed specifically for the oil and gas industry. NTIC also offers worldwide, on-site, technical consulting for rust and corrosion prevention issues. NTIC s technical service consultants work directly with the end users of NTIC s ZERUST rust and corrosion inhibiting products to analyze their specific needs and develop systems to meet their performance requirements. In North America, NTIC sells its ZERUST corrosion prevention solutions through a network of independent distributors and agents supported by a direct sales force. 
 
 Internationally, NTIC sells its ZERUST corrosion prevention solutions through its wholly-owned subsidiary in China, NTIC (Shanghai) Co., Ltd. (NTIC China), its majority-owned joint venture holding company for NTIC s joint venture investments in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) region, NTI Asean LLC (NTI Asean), certain majority-owned and wholly-owned subsidiaries, and joint venture arrangements in North America, Europe, and Asia. Effective as of September 1, 2021, NTIC purchased the remaining ownership interest in Harita-NTI Limited (Harita-NTI) and now sells its ZERUST products in India through this wholly-owned subsidiary. NTIC also sells products directly to its European joint venture partners through its wholly-owned subsidiary in Germany, NTIC Europe GmbH (NTI Europe). 
 
 One of NTIC s strategic initiatives is to expand into and penetrate other markets for its ZERUST corrosion prevention technologies. Consequently, for the past several years, NTIC has focused significant sales and marketing efforts on the oil and gas industry, as the infrastructure that supports that industry is typically constructed using metals that are highly susceptible to corrosion. NTIC believes that its ZERUST corrosion prevention solutions will minimize maintenance downtime on critical oil and gas industry infrastructure, extend the life of such infrastructure, and reduce the risk of environmental pollution due to leaks caused by corrosion. 
 
 NTIC markets and sells its ZERUST rust and corrosion prevention solutions to customers in the oil and gas industry in a continuously increasing number of countries either directly, through its subsidiaries, or through its joint venture partners and other strategic partners. The sale of ZERUST corrosion prevention solutions to customers in the oil and gas industry typically involves long sales cycles, often including multi-year trial periods with each customer and a slow integration process thereafter. 

Natur-Tec bio-based and compostable plastics are manufactured using NTIC s patented and/or proprietary technologies and are intended to replace conventional petroleum-based plastics. The Natur-Tec biopolymer resin compound portfolio includes formulations that have been optimized for a variety of applications, including blown-film extrusion, sheet/profile extrusion, injection molding, extrusion coating/lamination and engineered plastics. These resin compounds are certified to be fully biodegradable in a commercial composting environment and are currently being used to produce finished products, including can liners, shopping and grocery bags, lawn and leaf bags, branded apparel packaging bags and accessories, and various foodservice items, such as disposable cutlery, drinking straws, food-handling gloves, and coated paper products. In North America, NTIC markets its Natur-Tec resin compounds and finished products primarily through a network of regional and national distributors as well as independent agents. NTIC continues to see significant opportunities for finished bioplastic products and, therefore, continues to strengthen and expand its North American distribution network for finished Natur-Tec bioplastic products. 

1

Internationally, NTIC sells its Natur-Tec resin compounds and finished products both directly and through its NTIC China wholly-owned subsidiary as well as its Natur-Tec India and Natur-Tec Lanka majority-owned subsidiaries in India and Sri Lanka, and through distributors and certain joint ventures. 
 
 Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic and Worldwide Supply Chain Disruptions 
 
 Beginning last year, the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic negatively impacted the global economy, disrupted global supply chains, created significant volatility and disruption in financial markets and resulted in lockdowns. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and related government mandated restrictions on the Company s business, as well as the businesses of its joint ventures, customers and suppliers, disruption to the Company s business and the manufacture and sale of its products and services has occurred. In fiscal year 2021, the Company was impacted by shipping issues, including freight container shortages, shipping delays, and increased costs, and supply chain issues, including longer lead times and raw material cost increases. These impacts were largely a result of disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and the uptick in demand due to the ongoing global economic recovery. While there has been some recovery in the global economy and financial markets due in part to the easing of government mandated restrictions due to lower rates of infection, these restrictions may be reinstated if rates of infection continue to rise due to the Delta variant or subsequent variants of COVID-19, which could cause the COVID-19 pandemic to continue to have a material adverse effect on NTIC s business, operating results and financial condition in fiscal 2022. 
 
 Worldwide supply chain disruptions, which were initially brought about by the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, have persisted despite the recovery in the global economy and financial markets, and these issues are expected to continue in fiscal 2022. In fiscal 2021, NTIC experienced longer lead times for raw materials, was forced to find new suppliers of certain raw materials, and experienced raw material cost increases compared to prior fiscal years. Additionally, NTIC experienced significantly longer shipping times and significant price increases per shipping container compared to prior fiscal years due to ocean freight capacity issues resulting from increased demand for shipping and reduced capacity and equipment. These and other issues resulting from worldwide supply chain disruptions are expected to continue in fiscal 2022 and could continue to have a material adverse effect on NTIC s business, operating results and financial condition. The precise financial impact and duration, however, cannot be reasonably estimated at this time.

 (1) Indirect ownership interest through NTI Asean. 
 
 NTIC receives funds from its joint ventures as fees received for services that NTIC provides to its joint ventures and as dividend distributions. The fees for services provided to joint ventures are determined based on either a flat fee or a percentage of sales depending on local laws and tax regulations. With respect to NTIC s joint venture in Germany (EXCOR), NTIC recognizes an agreed upon quarterly fee for services. NTIC recognizes equity income from each joint venture based on the overall profitability of the joint venture. Such profitability is subject to variability from quarter to quarter, which, in turn, subjects NTIC s earnings to variability from quarter to quarter. The profits of each joint venture are shared by the respective joint venture owners in accordance with their respective ownership percentages. NTIC typically directly or indirectly owns 50 or less of each of its joint venture entities and, thus, does not control the decisions of these entities regarding whether dividends are paid and, if so, what amount is paid in a given year. The payment of a dividend by an entity is determined by a joint vote of the owners and is not at the sole discretion of NTIC. 
 
 As of August 31, 2021, Harita-NTI Limited was a joint venture and consolidated using the equity method of accounting. Harita-NTI Limited only became a wholly owned subsidiary as of September 1, 2021. 
 
 NTIC accounts for the investments and financial results of its joint ventures in its financial statements utilizing the equity method of accounting. 
 
 NTIC considers EXCOR to be individually significant to NTIC s consolidated assets and income as of August 31, 2021. NTIC considers EXCOR, ACOBAL SAS, ZERUST OY, ZERUST SPECIALTY TECH CO. LTD. and its former joint venture, Harita-NTI Limited, to be individually significant to NTIC s consolidated assets and income as of August 31, 2020. Therefore, NTIC provides certain additional information regarding these joint ventures in the notes to NTIC s consolidated financial statements and in this section of this report.

For more information regarding NTIC s joint ventures and their effect on NTIC s operating results, see NTIC s consolidated financial statements in Part II. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data and Part II. Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this report. 
 
 Products 
 
 NTIC derives revenues directly and/or indirectly through its subsidiaries and joint ventures from two reportable business segments based on products sold, customer base, and distribution center: ZERUST corrosion prevention solutions and Natur-Tec resin compounds and finished products. 
 
 ZERUST Corrosion Prevention Solutions . In fiscal 2021, 80.6 of NTIC s consolidated net sales were derived from developing, manufacturing and marketing ZERUST rust and corrosion inhibiting products and services. NTIC s consolidated net sales in fiscal 2021 included 45,554,434 in sales of ZERUST rust and corrosion inhibiting products and services, an increase of 32.1 from such sales in fiscal 2020. Corrosion not only damages the appearance of metal products and components but also negatively impacts their mechanical performance. This applies to the rusting of ferrous metals (iron and steel) and the deterioration by oxidation of nonferrous metals (aluminum, copper, brass, etc.). NTIC s ZERUST corrosion prevention solutions include plastic and paper packaging, powders, liquids, coatings, rust removers, cleaners, diffusers, and engineered solutions for the oil and gas industry as well as technical corrosion management and consulting services. 
 
 Plastic and Paper Packaging . NTIC s ZERUST packaging products contain proprietary chemical formulations that continuously release invisible, odorless and non-toxic vapor that forms a passivating layer on any metal surfaces it comes in contact with and thereby inhibits rust and corrosion. The corrosion inhibiting protection is maintained only as long as the metal products to be protected remain enclosed within the ZERUST packaging. Electron scanning shows that once metal products are removed from the ZERUST packaging, the ZERUST protective layer dissipates from the contents surfaces within two hours, leaving a clean, dry, and corrosion-free metal component. This mechanism of corrosion protection enables NTIC s customers to easily package metal objects for rust-free shipment and/or long-term storage. Furthermore, by eliminating costly greasing and degreasing processes and/or significantly reducing the use of certain coatings to inhibit corrosion, NTIC s ZERUST corrosion prevention solutions provide customers significant savings as compared to traditional methods of corrosion prevention in terms of labor, material, and capital expenditures for equipment to apply, remove, and dispose of oils and greases, as well as environmental, health and safety benefits provided by not having to handle and work with hazardous chemicals. 
 
 NTIC was first to develop the means of infusing volatile corrosion inhibiting chemical compounds (VCIs) into polyethylene and polypropylene resins. Combining ZERUST chemical compounds with polyethylene and polypropylene resins permitted NTIC to introduce a line of plastic packaging products in the form of low and high-density polyethylene bags and shroud film, including stretch, shrink, skin, and bubble cushioning film, thereby giving customers the ability to ship and store ferrous, nonferrous, and mixed-metal products in a clean, dry, and corrosion-free condition, at an overall savings in total process costs. In addition to plastic packaging, NTIC has also developed VCI compounds to imbue kraft paper, corrugated cardboard, solid fiber, and chipboard packaging materials with corrosion protection properties. NTIC s ZERUST plastic and paper packaging products come in various thicknesses, strength enhancements, protection types, shapes, and sizes. This product line also includes items such as ZERUST gun cases, car covers, and tool-drawer liners, which are targeted at retail consumers. 
 
 Liquids and Coatings . NTIC s corrosion prevention solutions include a line of metal surface treatment liquids and coatings, which are oil, water, or bio-solvent based, and are marketed under brand names including Axxatec , Axxanol , and Z-Maxx . These liquids and coatings provide powerful protection in aggressively corrosive environments, such as salt air, high humidity, and/or high temperatures. Products are formulated for most metal types and protection levels. For exceptionally harsh environments, customers may choose to use a combination of NTIC s liquids and coatings with ZERUST plastic and/or paper products to achieve robust corrosion protection during manufacturing, shipping, and warehousing stages. 

4

Rust Removers and Cleaners . NTIC also sells rust removal and cleaning products, under the Axxaclean brand name, designed to restore rusty parts to a usable condition without the use of labor-intensive, abrasive cleaners that damage surfaces and commonly fail to remove rust from complex metal surfaces, like the teeth of small gears. 
 
 Diffusers . NTIC s corrosion prevention solutions include a line of corrosion inhibiting vapor diffusers, such as ZERUST ActivPak , ZERUST ICT Vapor Capsules, ZERUST ICT Plastabs , ZERUST ICT Cor-Tabs , ZERUST ICT Pipe Strip, and ZERUST ICT Tube Strip. These diffusers are designed to protect metals within enclosures, like switch gearboxes and electronics cabinets, or can be used as extra protection when added to ZERUST packaging products. Diffusers work by permeating the interior air of an enclosure with an invisible and odorless corrosion inhibiting vapor that settles as a protective layer on all metal surfaces that are within the range of a specific radius of protection for a period of one or two years depending on the product model. This invisible and dry protective layer revaporizes and dissipates into the air upon removal of a diffuser from an enclosure, leaving all surfaces clean, dry, residue-free, and corrosion-free. 
 
 Z-CIS Technical Services . As an on-going effort to help NTIC s customers improve and control their corrosion management processes, NTIC markets and offers unique corrosion management and consulting services to target customers. This ZERUST corrosion inhibition system (known as Z-CIS leverages NTIC s global network to dispatch highly-trained technical service engineers to customer sites to solve complex corrosion problems. Several major automotive companies and their automotive parts suppliers have used NTIC s Z CIS system. 
 
 ZERUST Corrosion Prevention Solutions Designed Specifically for the Oil and Gas Industry . NTIC has developed proprietary engineered corrosion inhibiting solutions specifically for the mitigation of corrosion of the types of capital assets used in the petroleum and chemical process industries and has targeted the sale of these ZERUST corrosion solutions to potential customers in the oil and gas industry. NTIC s consolidated net sales in fiscal 2021 included 3,793,466 in sales made to customers in the oil and gas industry, an increase of 36.3 from such sales in fiscal 2020. NTIC anticipates that its sales of ZERUST products and services into the oil and gas industry will continue to remain subject to significant volatility, specifically due to economic factors, such as potential crude oil price changes and global production slowdowns caused by travel and other restrictions that may be reinstated as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. NTIC anticipates that its sales of ZERUST products and services into the oil and gas industry may be subject to additional volatility due to uncertainty caused by certain environmental policies of the current administration. Demand for ZERUST oil and gas products around the world depends primarily on market acceptance and the reach of NTIC s distribution network. Because of the typical size of individual orders and overall size of NTIC s net sales derived from sales of oil and gas products, the timing of one or more orders can materially affect NTIC s sales compared to prior fiscal year period sales. Projects in Europe and the Middle East are a small but strategically important part of the sales growth picture. 
 
 The infrastructure/assets that support the oil and gas industry are predominantly constructed using metals that are highly susceptible to corrosion. The industrial environment at these facilities usually contains compounds, including sulfides and chlorides, which cause aggressive corrosion. This problem affects the service life and safety of pipelines, petroleum storage tanks, spare parts in long-term storage, processing, and other critical equipment. In addition to the costs associated with the replacement of parts and structures, maintenance and repairs, and product loss, there are significant economic losses associated with critical infrastructure being down for repair and maintenance. Furthermore, there are also considerable health, safety, and environmental risks caused by corrosion that can greatly increase economic losses. While the industry predominantly uses various paints/coatings, engineered alloys, cathodic protection, etc. to mitigate corrosion, there are several situations where such options are not feasible and NTIC believes that its ZERUST oil and gas corrosion prevention solutions are more effective at minimizing maintenance downtime on critical oil and gas industry infrastructure, extend the life of such infrastructure, and reduce the risk of environmental pollution due to leaks caused by corrosion. 
 
 NTIC s rust and corrosion inhibiting products for the oil and gas industry include ZERUST Flange Savers , ZERUST ReCAST-SSB solutions, and ZERUST chemicals, including Zerion powders and gels, in addition to many of the standard industrial ZERUST rust and corrosion inhibiting products previously described. 
 
 ZERUST Flange Savers are specially designed covers that have been impregnated with a proprietary ZERUST inhibitor formulation to provide corrosion protection for flanges, valves, and welded joints. Oil and gas pipeline segments are connected by flanges and welded joints of varying sizes, designs, and materials. These connection points often corrode under aggressive industrial environments and harsh operating conditions, thereby causing costly maintenance, operational, and safety problems. ZERUST Flange Savers are available in various sizes to accommodate different pipe diameters, pressure ratings, and international standards for pipeline valves and flanges.

ZERUST ReCAST-SSB solutions protect the Soil Side Bottoms (SSB) of aboveground storage tanks through a variety of unique and highly effective delivery systems designed by the Zerust Oil Gas team to deliver proprietary Zerion FVS corrosion inhibitor to spaces under tank bottoms that are susceptible to significant corrosion. Tank bottoms are typically made of steel plates, which are in direct contact with a foundation surface that may be concrete, sand/soil, or asphalt/bitumen. It is typically not possible to protect this underside surface with traditional coatings. Cathodic protection (CP) systems can only provide partial protection, but also have significant limitations that cause failures well ahead of the expected service life of a tank. The ZERUST solutions provide effective protection even to areas that cannot be addressed with CP. These are engineered solutions where each system is tailored to a customer s requirements depending on factors including the tank foundation design, specific environmental conditions, and tank diameter. 
 
 ZERUST Zerion powder-based inhibitor solutions include the following: 

Zerion FVS is a unique inhibitor blend that is used in both the SSB Solutions and in internal pipeline protection. This best-in-class product has been successfully deployed at multiple client sites in North and South America, Europe, the Middle East, India as well as other parts of Asia. 

Zerion FAN-5 is a lower cost inhibitor that is very effective at protecting metals upon contact. It can be used to treat large volumes of water that may be used for hydrotesting. In combination with Zerion FVS, it offers a more complete solution for the protection of pipeline internals. 

AutoFog is a revolutionary product that allows for the quick VCI saturation of large volume spaces without the need for mechanical fogging equipment. This rapid self-diffusing capability is designed for sealed void spaces, protection of large/complex assets like heat exchangers, and heater-treaters. 

Natur-Tec Resin Compounds and Finished Products. NTIC manufactures and sells a broad range of bioplastic packaging solutions, including bio-based and certified compostable (fully biodegradable) polymer resin compounds, and finished products under the Natur-Tec brand. NTIC s consolidated net sales in fiscal 2021 included 10,939,385 in sales of Natur-Tec resins and finished products, a decrease of 16.9 compared to sales in fiscal 2020. Market drivers such as volatile petroleum prices, reduced dependence on foreign oil, reduced carbon footprints, requirements by multinational brands for sustainable packaging solutions that meet Circular Economy and environmentally responsible end-of-life disposal mandates, and concerns about plastic residue in the environment have led to heightened interest in using sustainable, bio-based and renewable plant-biomass resources for the manufacture of plastics and industrial products. Plastics that are fully biodegradable in commercial composting or anaerobic digestor systems allow the safe and effective conversion of these plastics to carbon dioxide, water, and fertilizer at the end of their service life. Increased environmental and sustainability awareness at the corporate and consumer level, improved technical properties and product functionality, as well as recent foreign, state, and local governmental regulations banning the use of conventional plastics or mandating the use of certain biodegradable or compostable products, including regulations in China and India, have also fueled this interest in bio-based and biodegradable-compostable plastics. The term bio-plastics encompasses a broad category of plastics that are either bio-based, which means derived from renewable resources such as corn or cellulosic/plant material or blends thereof, or are engineered to be fully commercially compostable, or both. 
 
 Natur-Tec resins and finished products sales in North America and finished product sales at NTIC s majority-owned subsidiary in India, Natur-Tec India Private Limited, experienced reduced demand globally as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic continues to have an impact on demand from many large users of bioplastics, including college campuses, stadiums, arenas, restaurants, and corporate office complexes. These are expected to be some of the last businesses to re-open, and many of these institutions have still not reopened to pre-COVID capacity. Furthermore, production across the apparel industry has declined sharply, further decreasing demand for our Natur-Tec bioplastic bags, which have become an important part of the sustainability initiatives within this industry. 
 
 Resin Compounds . Natur-Tec resin compounds are produced by blending commonly available base resins, such as Ecoflex from BASF, Ingeo PLA from NatureWorks LLC, and Luminy from Total-Corbion with organic and inorganic fillers and proprietary polymer modifiers and compatibilizers using NTIC s proprietary and patented ReX Process. In this process, biodegradable polymers, natural polymers made from renewable, plant-biomass resources, and organic and inorganic materials are reactively blended in the presence of proprietary compatibilizers and polymer modifiers to produce bio-based and/or compostable polymer resin formulations that exhibit unique and stable morphology. Natur-Tec resin compounds are engineered for high performance, ease of processing, and reduced cost compared to most other bio-plastic materials and can be processed by converters using conventional plastic manufacturing processes and equipment.

Natur-Tec resin compounds are sold in several grades tailored for a variety of applications, such as blown-film extrusion, profile extrusion, thermoforming, extrusion coating, and injection molding. 
 
 Natur-Tec flexible film resin compounds are fully commercially compostable and meet the requirements of international standards for compostable plastics, such as ASTM (American Society for Testing and Materials) D6400 (U.S.), EN 13432 (European standards for products and services by European Committee for Standardization), and ISO (International Organization for Standardization) 17088, and are certified as 100 compostable by organizations including the BPI (Biodegradable Products Institute) in the United States and T V Austria in Europe. Natur-Tec film resin compounds can be used to produce film for applications, such as bags, including compost bags, lawn and leaf bags, pet waste collection bags, and carry-out bags, agricultural film, and consumer and industrial packaging. Natur-Tec film resin compounds are also used to produce bags and covers for branded apparel packaging and to manufacture specialty foodservice items, such as compostable drinking straws, thermoformed lids and disposable food-handling gloves. 
 
 The Natur-Tec compostable extrusion coating resin compounds are bio-based and biodegradable and are designed to replace conventional plastic materials for extrusion coating applications. Natur-Tec extrusion coating resin compounds are manufactured using sustainable and renewable resources, per the ASTM D6866 standard, which allows companies and consumers the opportunity to reduce or neutralize their carbon footprint and are designed to meet the requirements of international standards for compostable plastics, such as ASTM D6400. Natur-Tec extrusion coating resin compounds provide good adhesion to paper, an excellent print surface, and good heat seal strength and the coating material is suitable for food contact applications, including both hot and cold applications. Natur-Tec extrusion coating resin compounds can be used for coating paper and paperboards for the manufacture of disposable cups, plates, and other foodservice items. 
 
 The Natur-Tec compostable injection molding resin compounds are bio-based and compostable and are designed to replace conventional plastic materials for injection molded plastic applications. Natur-Tec compostable injection molding resin compounds are manufactured using sustainable and renewable resources, per the ASTM D6866 standard, and are designed to meet the requirements of international standards for compostable plastics, such as ASTM D6400 and EN 13432. Natur-Tec compostable injection molding resin compounds can be used for injection molded plastic applications, such as cutlery, pens, hangers, containers, and packaging. Natur-Tec bio-based injection molding resin compounds are made with at least 90 bio-based/renewable resource-based materials, per the ASTM D6866 standard, and are meant to enhance sustainability by replacing petroleum-based plastics. Natur-Tec bio-based injection molding resin compounds exhibit the same properties as conventional plastic materials and can be used in applications such as automotive components, consumer goods, electronics, medical products, furniture, and packaging. 
 
 Finished Products . Natur-Tec finished products include totally biodegradable and compostable trash bags, agricultural film, and other single-use disposable products, such as compostable cutlery and food and consumer goods packaging currently marketed under the Natur-Bag or Natur-Ware brands. 
 
 The Natur-Bag product line offers 15 different compostable trash bag sizes, from 3-gallon to 96-gallon, as well as shopper bags, produce bags and gloves. The bags are available in various SKU configurations, including retail packs that are sold to the consumer either through retail outlets or through online stores and industrial case packs that are sold to commercial and industrial customers primarily through wholesalers and distributors. The Natur-Bag products are manufactured from the Natur-Tec flexible film resin compounds and thus are fully biodegradable and compostable. 
 
 The Natur-Ware product line consists of bio-based and compostable cutlery made from the Natur-Tec compostable injection molding resin compounds. Natur-Ware cutlery can be composted along with food scraps in zero-waste programs.

Both Natur-Bag and Natur-Ware products are certified fully commercially compostable and carry the BPI Compostable logo in the United States and the T V Austria OK Compost logo in Europe. Furthermore, these products were also independently tested and approved for use in organic waste diversion systems by Cedar Grove, one of the largest compost operators in the United States. 
 
 Sales, Marketing, and Distribution 
 
 ZERUST Corrosion Prevention Solutions . In the United States, NTIC markets its ZERUST rust and corrosion inhibiting products and services, including its products designed for the oil and gas industry, principally to industrial users in the automotive, electronics, electrical, mechanical, military, retail consumer, and oil and gas markets by a direct sales force and through a network of independent distributors, manufacturer s sales representatives, and strategic partners. Prior to placing an order, NTIC s technical service consultants work directly with the end users of NTIC s ZERUST products to analyze their specific corrosion prevention needs and develop systems to meet their performance requirements. 
 
 Internationally, NTIC has entered into a series of joint ventures with foreign partners (either directly or through a holding company). NTIC receives fees for providing technical support, marketing assistance, and other services to its joint ventures based primarily on the net sales of the individual joint ventures in accordance with the terms of the joint venture arrangements. Such services include consulting, legal, insurance, technical, and marketing services. 
 
 In China, NTIC sells its products and services through NTIC China. NTIC has wholly-owned or majority-owned subsidiaries to conduct its business in Brazil, Mexico, Vietnam and Singapore. In addition, effective as of September 1, 2021, NTIC purchased the remaining 50 ownership interest in its Indian joint venture, Harita-NTI Limited, and will continue selling its ZERUST products in India through this wholly-owned subsidiary. 
 
 With respect to the sales and marketing of ZERUST rust and corrosion inhibiting products and services to the oil and gas industry, NTIC uses a combination of direct sales personnel, independent sales agents, and its joint venture network. In addition, in an attempt to penetrate the oil and gas industry within certain markets more quickly, NTIC has entered into various agreements with specific organizations that have existing long-term relationships with key oil and gas industry clients. NTIC also engages in certain direct marketing activities to build its brand within the oil and gas industry, such as traditional advertising and direct mail campaigns and presence and participation at selected key trade shows and technical forums. Additionally, NTIC has worked to adapt its marketing activities in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. NTIC continues to believe the sale of its ZERUST corrosion prevention solutions to customers in the oil and gas industry will involve long sales cycles, likely including multi-year trial periods with each user and a slow integration process thereafter. 
 
 Natur-Tec Resin Compounds and Finished Products . In the United States, NTIC markets its Natur-Tec resin compounds and finished products through a network of national and regional distributors and independent manufacturer s sales representatives and two NTIC direct sales employees as of August 31, 2021. Target customers for Natur-Tec finished products include individual consumers as well as commercial and institutional organizations, such as corporations and government agencies, and educational organizations, such as universities and school districts. NTIC is also targeting key national and regional retailers utilizing independent sales agents. Target customers for Natur-Tec resin compounds include plastics converters and foodserviceware brands that would purchase Natur-Tec resin compounds to manufacture and sell their own finished bio-based and compostable end products, such as film, bags, and cutlery. Additionally, NTIC has targeted retailers and customers that may have applications for our products related to the COVID-19 pandemic. 
 
 Internationally, NTIC uses Natur-Tec India, Natur Tec Lanka, NTIC China and a network of international distributors to market its Natur-Tec resin compounds and finished products. The government of India recently announced a phased ban on the manufacture and sale of single-use plastics beginning in July 2022. The first phase bans earbuds and plastic sticks used in balloons and ice cream. The second phase bans plastic cigarette packets and plastic bags less than 100 microns thick. Notably, compostable plastics are exempt from this ban. Accordingly, NTIC expects the market in India for bio-plastic packaging solutions to continue to grow substantially. Similarly, in the last fiscal year, NTIC saw a rise in the sales of Natur-Tec products in China and anticipates that sales will continue to grow.

Competition 
 
 ZERUST Corrosion Prevention Solutions . While NTIC is unaware of any third parties with which NTIC competes on a worldwide basis with respect to its corrosion prevention solutions, NTIC does compete with several third parties on a regional basis. NTIC evaluates competing rust and corrosion inhibiting products on an ongoing basis. Some of NTIC s competitors are established companies that may have financial resources, marketing capabilities, distribution networks and other resources substantially greater than those of NTIC. As a result, they may be able to adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements or to devote greater resources to the promotion and sale of their products than NTIC. With respect to its rust and corrosion inhibiting products, NTIC competes on the basis of product innovation, quality, reliability, product support, customer service, reputation, and price. Some of NTIC s competitors may have achieved significant market acceptance of their competing products and brand recognition. NTIC, however, believes it has an advantage over most of its competitors as a result of NTIC s technical innovation and its value-added services. NTIC attempts to provide its customers with the highest level of technical service and applications engineering in addition to ZERUST rust and corrosion inhibiting products. Nonetheless, the commoditization of certain of NTIC s ZERUST rust and corrosion inhibiting products has led, and may continue to lead, to lower prices and lower margins on such products. In addition, because certain barriers to entry are low, additional competitors may emerge, which likely would lead to the further commoditization of NTIC s rust and corrosion inhibiting products. 
 
 With respect to NTIC s corrosion prevention solutions for use in the oil and gas industry, NTIC s primary barrier to entry is a combination of conservatism, complacency, and confidence in old approaches, as well as the complexity of the buying organizations. Some of NTIC s competitors with respect to its traditional ZERUST rust and corrosion inhibiting products also compete in the oil and gas industry. NTIC also faces competition from new suppliers who provide alternative approaches to corrosion prevention, some of which have a significant market presence and more years of experience and credibility in the oil and gas industry. Original equipment manufacturer (OEM) suppliers to the oil and gas industry present a new market vertical for NTIC s traditional industrial ZERUST products. 
 
 Natur-Tec Resin Compounds and Finished Products. With respect to NTIC s Natur-Tec resin compounds and finished products, NTIC competes with several established companies that have been producing and selling similar products for a significantly longer time period and have significantly more sales, more extensive and effective distribution networks, and better brand recognition than NTIC. Most of these companies also have substantially more financial and other resources than NTIC. NTIC competes on the basis of performance, brand awareness, distribution network, product availability, product offering, improved shelf life, place of manufacture, and price. Because of price competition, NTIC s margins on its Natur-Tec resin compounds and finished products are lower than its margins on its ZERUST corrosion prevention solutions. NTIC also has encountered in the past and could continue to encounter additional supply constraints for the base polymer resins used to manufacture NTIC s Natur-Tec resin compounds and finished products since there are a limited number of suppliers of such base polymer resins and limited capacity for their production. 
 
 Research and Development 
 
 NTIC s research and development activities are directed at improving existing products, developing new products, reducing costs, and improving quality assurance through improved testing of NTIC s products. NTIC s internal research and development activities are conducted at its facilities located in Circle Pines, Minnesota; Beachwood, Ohio; and Dresden, Germany under the direction of internationally known scientists and research institutes under exclusive contract with NTIC with respect to the subject of their respective research efforts. EXCOR has established a wholly-owned subsidiary, Excor Korrosionsforschung GmbH, to conduct research into new fields of corrosion inhibiting packaging and the applications engineering of such products in conjunction with NTIC s domestic research and development operations. With respect to NTIC s Natur-Tec resin compounds and finished products, Ramani Narayan, Ph.D., a current director of NTIC and Distinguished Professor in the Department of Chemical Engineering Materials Science at Michigan State University, provides his expertise and technical support to NTIC. 
 
 NTIC anticipates that it will spend between 4,400,000 and 4,800,000 in fiscal 2022 on research and development activities.

Intellectual Property Rights 
 
 NTIC s success depends and will continue to depend in part upon its ability to maintain patent and trademark protection for its products and processes, to preserve its proprietary information and trade secrets, and to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties. NTIC s policy is to attempt to protect its technology by, among other things, filing patent applications and trademark applications and vigorously preserving the trade secrets covering its technology and other intellectual property rights. 
 
 In 1980, NTIC developed and patented the first polyolefin (plastic) based industrial corrosion inhibiting packing material in the world. The U.S. patent granted under this patent application became the most important intellectual property right in NTIC s history. This patent expired in 2000. NTIC has since filed for 12 letters of patent in the United States covering various corrosion inhibiting technologies, systems, and applications and now owns several patents in these areas. These patents and patent applications have been extended to the countries of strategic relevance to NTIC, including Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Europe, Japan, India, Korea, Mexico, Russia, and Taiwan. In addition, EXCOR owns several patents in the area covering various corrosion inhibiting technologies and has also applied for new patents on proprietary new corrosion inhibiting technologies. NTIC is also seeking additional patent protection covering various host materials into which its corrosion inhibiting additives and other protective features can be incorporated, proprietary new process technologies, and chemical formulations outside the area of corrosion protection. NTIC owns several patents outside the area of corrosion protection both in the United States and in countries of strategic relevance to NTIC, including the above-noted countries. 
 
 In addition to seeking patent protection, NTIC maintains an extensive portfolio of trademarks in countries where NTIC has a presence directly or through its subsidiaries and joint ventures. NTIC continuously pursues new trademark applications of strategic interest worldwide. NTIC owns the following U.S. registered trademarks: NTI , NTI Globe Design , ZERUST , EXCOR , ICT , Z-CIS , COR TAB , PLASTABS , NATUR-TEC , NATUR-TEC Design , NATUR-BAG and NATUR-WARE , ZERION , AUTOFOG , FLANGE SAVER , and ACTIVPAK . NTIC also has a registered trademark on the use of the Color Yellow with respect to corrosion inhibiting packaging. Furthermore, NTI , ZERUST , EXCOR , the Color Yellow , and NTI ASEAN , as well as other marks, have been registered in the European Union, and several new applications are pending. 
 
 NTIC requires its employees, consultants, and advisors with access to its confidential information, including trade secrets, to execute confidentiality agreements upon commencement of their employment or consulting relationships with NTIC. These agreements generally provide that all confidential information NTIC develops or makes known to the individual during the course of the individual s employment or consulting relationship with NTIC must be kept confidential by the individual and not disclosed to any third parties. NTIC also requires all of its employees and consultants who perform research and development for NTIC to execute agreements that generally provide that all inventions developed by these individuals during their employment or service arrangement with NTIC will fall under NTIC s proprietary intellectual property rights. 
 
 Manufacturing 
 
 NTIC s ZERUST rust and corrosion inhibiting products are manufactured according to NTIC s specifications primarily by selected independent sub-contractors under trade secrecy agreements and/or license agreements. In addition, NTIC manufactures select ZERUST rust and corrosion inhibiting products, consisting primarily of liquids and powders, at its corporate headquarters location in Circle Pines, Minnesota. 
 
 NTIC s Natur-Tec resin compounds and finished products are produced at facilities in India, China, Malaysia, and the United States. NTIC s Natur-Tec resin compounds can be shipped to manufacturing facilities around the world, where they then can be converted into finished products, such as film or piece of cutlery. NTIC s Natur-Tec finished products are manufactured using NTIC s Natur-Tec resin compounds by select sub-contractors. 
 
 NTIC is ISO 9001 certified with respect to the manufacturing of its products. NTIC believes that the process of ISO 9001 certification serves as an excellent total quality management tool, enabling NTIC to ensure consistency in the performance of its products. In addition, because potential customers may prefer or require manufacturers to have achieved ISO certification, such ISO certifications may provide NTIC with certain competitive advantages. 

10

Availability of Raw Materials 
 
 NTIC does not typically carry excess quantities of raw materials because of historically widespread availability for such materials from various suppliers. However, with respect to its Natur-Tec resin compounds and finished products, there are a limited number of suppliers of the base resins used to manufacture the resin compounds and finished products. Additionally, there is growing demand for these base resins, which has caused cost increases and, more recently, supply issues. In the past and during fiscal year 2021, NTIC has experienced some delays in obtaining these base resins. Due to supply chain disruptions associated with the COVID-19 pandemic and otherwise, NTIC experienced longer lead times for raw materials, was forced to find new suppliers of certain raw materials, and experienced raw material cost increases during fiscal 2021 compared to prior fiscal years. It is anticipated that these worldwide disruption in supply issues will continue throughout fiscal year 2022. Additionally, during fiscal year 2021, extreme weather caused supply chain disruptions and caused delays in receiving base resins. 
 
 In addition, a few raw materials and purchased parts used in NTIC s rust and corrosion inhibiting products and Natur-Tec finished products are sourced from suppliers who currently serve as NTIC s sole source of supply for these materials and parts. Although NTIC believes it can obtain these raw materials and parts from other suppliers, an unexpected loss of supply over a short period of time, including as a result of the worldwide disruption in supply issues, may not allow NTIC time to replace these sources in the ordinary course of business. 
 
 Backlog 
 
 NTIC had an estimated order backlog of 4,192,000 as of August 31, 2021, compared to 3,593,000 as of August 31, 2020, which was generally across all business units. Sales relating to this backlog are expected to be realized during first quarter of fiscal 2022. These are orders that are held by NTIC pending release instructions from the customers to be used for just-in-time production. Customers generally place orders on an as needed basis and expect delivery within a relatively short period of time. 
 
 Governmental Regulation 
 
 The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has indicated to NTIC that it has no objection to the use of ZERUST ICT packaging products in protecting metal food containers and processing equipment. In addition, the manufacture, sale and use of NTIC s Natur-Tec resin compounds and finished products are subject to regulation in the United States by the FDA. The FDA s regulations are concerned with substances used in food packaging materials. Thus, food and beverage containers are in compliance with FDA regulations if the components used in the food and beverage containers are approved by the FDA as indirect food additives for their intended uses and comply with the applicable FDA indirect food additive regulations or are generally recognized as safe for their intended uses and are of suitable purity for those intended uses. NTIC believes that its resin compounds are in compliance with all FDA requirements and that NTIC does not require further FDA approval prior to the sale of its products.

Item 1A. RISK FACTORS 
 
 The following are the most material factors known to NTIC that could materially adversely affect its business, operating results, or financial condition. 
 
 Risk Factors Summary 
 
 This summary is not complete and should be read in conjunction with the risk factors set forth below. 
 
 Risks Related to NTIC s Business and Industry 

Any weakness in the global economy, and in particular in the United States, Europe, India and China, and in the automotive industry, may negatively impact NTIC s business, operating results, and financial condition. 

The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely impacted and will likely continue to adversely impact NTIC s business, operating results and financial condition. 

Supply chain disruptions could interrupt product manufacturing, increase product costs and result in lost sales, which may have a material adverse effect on NTIC s business, operating results and financial condition. 

Disruptions to the distribution channels for NTIC s products may negatively impact NTIC s business, operating results, and financial condition. 

NTIC s dependence on key suppliers puts NTIC at risk of interruptions in the availability of its products, which could reduce its net sales and adversely affect its operating results and harm its reputation. 

NTIC s dependence on key suppliers puts NTIC at risk of interruptions in the availability of its products, which could reduce its net sales and adversely affect its operating results and harm its reputation. 

Increases in prices for raw materials and components used in NTIC s products could adversely affect NTIC s operating results. 

NTIC relies on others for its production and any interruptions of these arrangements could disrupt NTIC s ability to fill its customers orders. 

Changes to trade regulation, quotas, duties, or tariffs, caused by the changing U.S. and geopolitical environments or otherwise, may negatively impact NTIC s business, operating results, and financial condition. 

Global credit and financial markets in the past have experienced disruptions, including diminished liquidity and credit availability and rapid fluctuations in market valuations, which, if they happen again, could negatively impact NTIC s business, operating results, and financial condition. 

NTIC has limited staffing, faces challenges caused by its aging workforce and given its limited resources, it may not effectively manage its growth. 

Risks Related to NTIC s Joint Ventures 

NTIC s liquidity and financial position rely on the receipt of fees for services provided to its joint ventures and dividend distributions from its joint ventures. No assurance can be provided that NTIC will continue to receive such fees and dividend distributions in amounts NTIC historically has received or anticipates receiving. 

Since a significant portion of NTIC s earnings results from its equity income from joint ventures which varies quarter to quarter, NTIC s earnings are subject to quarterly fluctuations. 

Risks Related to NTIC s International Operations and the Foreign Markets in which NTIC Operates 

NTIC s international business, which is conducted primarily through its subsidiaries and joint ventures, requires management attention and financial resources and exposes NTIC to difficulties and risks presented by international economic, political, legal, accounting, and business factors. 

If sales of NTIC s products and services by its joint venture in Germany were to decline significantly or if NTIC s relationships with this joint venture were to deteriorate significantly, NTIC s operating results likely would be adversely affected. 

NTIC s recent acquisition of the remaining 50 ownership interest of Harita-NTI and any future similar acquisitions involve risk. 

NTIC China s operations may be adversely affected by China s evolving economic, political, and social conditions and intellectual property rights are difficult to enforce in China, which could harm NTIC s business, results of operations, or financial condition. 

Uncertainties with respect to the Chinese legal system may adversely affect the operations of NTIC China. 

Failure to comply with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act could subject NTIC to penalties and legal expenses. 

Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could result in declines in NTIC s earnings and changes in NTIC s foreign currency translation adjustments. 

Economic uncertainty in developing markets could adversely affect NTIC s revenue and earnings. 

17

Risks Related to NTIC s Products 

NTIC faces intense competition in almost all of its product lines, including from competitors that have substantially greater resources than NTIC does. No assurance can be provided that NTIC will be able to compete effectively, which would harm its business and operating results. 

NTIC s ZERUST rust and corrosion inhibiting products and services generate a significant portion of NTIC s net sales and the net sales of NTIC s joint ventures. Accordingly, if sales of these products and services were to decline, NTIC s operating results would be adversely affected. 

If NTIC is unable to continue to enhance its existing products and develop and market new products that respond to customer needs and achieve market acceptance, NTIC may experience a decrease in demand for its products, and its business could suffer. 

No assurance can be provided that NTIC s investments in additional research and development and marketing efforts and resources into the application of its corrosion prevention solutions into the oil and gas industry and the continued launch of its Natur-Tec resin compounds and finished products will be successful. 

NTIC s strategy of expanding its corrosion prevention solutions into the oil and gas industry and continuing the expansion of its Natur-Tec bioplastics resin compounds and finished products is risky and may not prove to be successful, which could harm NTIC s operating results and financial condition. 

NTIC s dependence on manufacturing and logistical services provided by contractors could give rise to product defect or warranty liability. 

The commercial success of NTIC s Natur-Tec resin compounds and finished products depends on the widespread market acceptance of products manufactured with bio-based and biodegradable resins. 

NTIC relies on its joint ventures, distributors, manufacturer s sales representatives, and other agents to market and sell its products. 

NTIC may be subject to product liability claims or other claims arising out of the activities of its joint ventures, which could adversely affect NTIC and its business, and the sale of ZERUST rust and corrosion inhibiting products into the oil and gas industry is risky in light of the hazards typically associated with such operations and the significant amount of potential liability involved. 

The sale of ZERUST rust and corrosion inhibiting products into the oil and gas industry is somewhat seasonal and dependent upon oil prices. 

The expansion of NTIC s corrosion prevention solutions into the oil and gas industry and the continued launch of NTIC s Natur-Tec resin compounds and finished products may require additional capital in the future, which may not be available or may be available only on unfavorable terms. 

Risks Related to Governmental Regulation, Laws, and Compliance 

NTIC s business, properties, and products are subject to governmental regulation and taxes, compliance with which may require NTIC to incur expenses or modify its products or operations, and which may expose NTIC to penalties for non-compliance. Governmental regulation also may adversely affect the demand for some of NTIC s products and its operating results. 

Fluctuations in NTIC s effective tax rate could have a significant impact on NTIC s financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. 

Certain of NTIC s operations are subject to regulation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. 

NTIC s reliance upon patents, trademark laws, trade secrets, and contractual provisions to protect its proprietary rights may not be sufficient to protect its intellectual property. 

NTIC s compliance with generally accepted accounting principles any changes in such principles might adversely affect NTIC s operating results and financial condition. 

Risks Related to NTIC s Common Stock 

The trading volume of NTIC s common stock is typically very low, leaving NTIC s common stock open to risk of high volatility and the price and trading volume has been, and may continue to be, volatile. 

A large percentage of NTIC s outstanding common stock is held by insiders, and, as a result, the trading market for NTIC s common stock is not as liquid as the stock of other public companies. 

18

Risks Related to NTIC s Business and Industry 
 
 Any weakness in the global economy, and in particular in the United States, Europe, India and China, and in the automotive industry, may negatively impact NTIC s business, operating results, and financial condition. 
 
 The U.S. and world economies may suffer from uncertainty, volatility, disruption, and other adverse conditions, such as the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and those conditions have adversely impacted and may continue to adversely impact the business community and the financial markets. Adverse economic and financial market conditions may negatively affect NTIC s customers and its markets, thereby negatively impacting its business and operating results. For example, weak market conditions could extend the length of NTIC s sales cycle and cause potential customers to delay, defer, or decline to make purchases of NTIC s products and services due to uncertainties surrounding the future performance of their businesses, limitations on their capital expenditures due to internal budget constraints, the inability to obtain financing in the capital markets, and the adverse effects of the economy on their business and financial condition. As a result, if economic and financial market conditions weaken or deteriorate, then NTIC s business, financial condition, and operating results, including its ability to grow and expand its business and operations, could be materially and adversely affected. 
 
 NTIC s operating results are especially dependent upon the economic health of the economies in the United States, Europe, India and China. Since a significant portion of NTIC s ZERUST rust and corrosion inhibiting products and services are sold to customers in the automotive industry, adverse economic conditions affecting the automotive industry, in particular, may result in an adverse effect on NTIC s net sales and its other operating results. Accordingly, any weakness in the global economy, particularly the United States, Europe, India and China, and in the automotive industry, including decreased production resulting from the ongoing microchip shortage, have negatively impacted and may continue to negatively impact NTIC s business, operating results, and financial condition. 
 
 The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely impacted and will likely continue to adversely impact NTIC s business, operating results and financial condition. 
 
 The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a periodic, substantial curtailment of business activities worldwide and has caused, and may again cause, recessionary economic conditions in many countries, including the United States and many countries abroad. As part of efforts to contain the spread of COVID-19, many state, local and foreign governments at times imposed various restrictions on the conduct of business and travel, including lockdowns imposed in parts of China and India during fiscal 2021. While some of these restrictions have been curtailed or lifted, others have been reinstated or may be reinstated in the future. Government restrictions, such as stay-at-home orders, quarantines and worker absenteeism as a result of COVID-19 have led to a significant number of business closures and slowdowns. These business closures and slowdowns adversely impacted, and will likely continue to adversely impact, NTIC directly and have caused its customers and suppliers to slow or stop production, which has significantly disrupted and will likely continue to significantly disrupt NTIC s sales, production and supply chain. These and other factors, such as uncertainty due to the Delta variant and other COVID-19 variants that may arise, contributed to NTIC experiencing significantly decreased global demand for its products and services during fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020 and increased supply chain and shipping costs and disruptions, which will likely continue during fiscal 2022. This significantly decreased demand has had, and will likely continue to have, a material adverse effect on NTIC s business, operating results and financial condition in fiscal 2022. Due to the international reach of COVID-19, NTIC anticipates that its international joint ventures will continue to be adversely impacted by the causes listed above, as well as other local issues that may arise, which will likely continue to have a material adverse effect on NTIC s joint venture operations and equity in income from joint ventures. It is currently not possible to predict the precise potential impact, as well as the extent of any impact, of the COVID-19 pandemic on NTIC s business, and on the global economy as a whole. It is also currently not possible to predict how long the pandemic will last or the time that it will take for economic activity to return to prior levels or supply chain disruptions to cease. A prolonged situation could have a significant adverse effect on economies and financial markets globally, potentially deepening the current worldwide economic downturn, which could have a significant adverse effect on NTIC s business, operating results and financial condition. 

19

The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts NTIC s business will likely depend on numerous evolving factors that NTIC may not be able to accurately predict, including: 

the duration and scope of the pandemic; 

governmental, business and individuals actions that have been and continue to be taken in response to the pandemic; 

the availability, acceptance and efficacy of vaccines; 

the spread of COVID-19 variants; 

the impact of the pandemic on economic activity and actions taken in response; 

the effect on NTIC s customers and demand for its products and services; 

NTIC s ability to continue to manufacture and sell its products and services, including as a result of travel restrictions and people working from home; 

the ability of NTIC s customers to pay for its products and services; and 

any closures of NTIC s facilities and the facilities of its customers and suppliers. 

Any of these events could materially adversely affect NTIC s business, operating results and financial condition. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic has already adversely affected and could continue to adversely affect NTIC s stock price. 
 
 Supply chain disruptions could interrupt product manufacturing, increase product costs and result in lost sales, which may have a material adverse effect on NTIC s business, operating results and financial condition. 
 
 Supply chain disruptions, resulting from factors such as the COVID-19 pandemic, labor supply shortages and shipping container shortages, have impacted, and may continue to impact, NTIC and its third-party manufacturers. These disruptions have resulted in longer lead times and increased product costs and shipping expenses. While NTIC has taken steps to minimize the impact of these increased costs by working closely with its suppliers and customers, there can be no assurances that unforeseen events impacting the supply chain will not have a material adverse effect on NTIC in the future. Additionally, the impacts supply chain disruptions have on NTIC s third-party manufacturers are not within NTIC s control. It is not currently possible to predict how long it will take for these supply chain disruptions to cease. Prolonged supply chain disruptions impacting NTIC and its third-party manufacturers could interrupt product manufacturing, increase product costs and result in lost sales, which may have a material adverse effect on NTIC s business, operating results and financial condition. 
 
 Disruptions to the distribution channels for NTIC s products may negatively impact NTIC s business, operating results, and financial condition. 
 
 During fiscal 2021, supply chain disruptions began to emerge because of the COVID-19 pandemic, shipping container shortages, and the changes in global demand. Ocean freight capacity issues continue to persist worldwide as there is much greater demand for shipping and reduced capacity and equipment, which has resulted in significantly longer shipping times and significant price increases per shipping container. Shipping companies are charging priority booking fees to allocate space as they have fewer ships and workers operating. While NTIC continues to manage and evaluate its freight carriers, there is no indication that these shipping delays and increased shipping container rates will return to historical levels in the near-term, and these delays and increases could have a material adverse effect on NTIC s consolidated results of operations. Furthermore, transportation delays, increases on shipping containers, more extensive travel restrictions, closures or disruptions of businesses and facilities or social, economic, political or labor instability in the affected areas may impact the operations of NTIC s suppliers, which could in turn adversely affect NTIC, and its revenues and operating costs. Any of these disruptions may negatively impact NTIC s business, operating results, and financial condition. 
 
 NTIC s dependence on key suppliers puts NTIC at risk of interruptions in the availability of its products, which could reduce its net sales and adversely affect its operating results and harm its reputation. 
 
 NTIC relies on suppliers for certain raw materials and components used in its products. For reasons of quality assurance, cost effectiveness, or availability, NTIC procures certain raw materials and components from sole or limited source suppliers. Among the limited source suppliers NTIC does business with are the manufacturers of plastic resins used in Natur-Tec products. NTIC generally acquires these and other raw materials and components through purchase orders placed in the ordinary course of business, and as a result, NTIC does not have a significant inventory of these materials and components and does not have any guaranteed or contractual supply arrangements with many of these suppliers for these materials and components. NTIC s dependence on third-party suppliers involves several risks, including limited control over pricing, availability, quality, and delivery schedules, as well as manufacturing yields and costs. Suppliers of such raw materials and components may decide, or be required, for reasons beyond NTIC s control, to cease supplying such raw materials and components to NTIC or to raise their prices. 

20

Shortages of raw materials, quality control problems, production capacity constraints, or delays by suppliers could negatively affect NTIC s ability to meet its production obligations and result in increased prices for affected parts. For example, the rapid growth in demand for bioplastics products globally has increased the demand and the price for plastic resins, and limited suppliers of such plastic resins may experience shortages caused by demand outpacing their production capabilities, which could result in NTIC s inability to produce its Natur-Tec products promptly or in the volumes demanded. Additionally, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has caused supply shortages, which also could result in NTIC s inability to produce its Natur-Tec products. These and other shortages, constraints, or delays may result in delays in shipments of products or components, which could adversely affect NTIC s net sales and other operating results and its reputation. From time to time, materials and components used in NTIC s products are subject to allocation because of shortages of these materials and components. 
 
 Increases in prices for raw materials and components used in NTIC s products could adversely affect NTIC s operating results. 
 
 NTIC uses certain raw materials and components in its products, including in particular plastic resins, which are subject to price increases. In light of increased global demand for bioplastics, the prices of certain plastic resins have increased, which could adversely affect gross margins on NTIC s Natur-Tec products. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused additional shortages in certain raw materials and components, which could adversely affect the cost and/or production of NTIC s products. Additionally, changes to international trade agreements could result in additional tariffs, duties, or other charges on raw materials or components we import into the U.S. Increases in prices for raw materials and components used in NTIC s products could adversely affect NTIC s gross margins and other operating results. 
 
 NTIC relies on others for its production and any interruptions of these arrangements could disrupt NTIC s ability to fill its customers orders. 
 
 NTIC utilizes contract manufacturers for a significant portion of its production requirements. The majority of NTIC s manufacturing is conducted in the United States by contract manufacturers that also perform services for numerous other companies. NTIC does not have a guaranteed level of production capacity with any of its contract manufacturers. Qualifying new contract manufacturers is time consuming and might result in unforeseen manufacturing and operations problems. The loss of NTIC s relationships with its contract manufacturers or their inability to conduct their manufacturing and assembly services for NTIC as anticipated in terms of capacity, cost, quality, and timeliness could adversely affect NTIC s ability to fill customer orders in accordance with required delivery, quality, and performance requirements, thus adversely affecting NTIC s net sales and other operating results. 
 
 Changes to trade regulation, quotas, duties, or tariffs, caused by the changing U.S. and geopolitical environments or otherwise, may negatively impact NTIC s business, operating results, and financial condition. 
 
 There is significant uncertainty about the future relationship between the United States and other countries with respect to trade policies, taxes, government regulations, and tariffs. The Trump administration had signaled support for implementing and, in some instances, proposed or took action with respect to major changes to certain trade policies in an effort to encourage U.S. production. Such changes included the imposition of additional tariffs on imported products in an effort to address trade imbalances, specifically with China, the withdrawal of the U.S. from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, and the renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement. In response to such actions, certain countries imposed retaliatory actions against the U.S. NTIC and its subsidiaries and joint ventures engage in sales outside of the United States and is, therefore, negatively impacted by such actions. Any changes or potential changes in trade policies in the United States, including changes made by the Biden administration, and the potential corresponding actions by other countries in which NTIC does business could adversely and materially affect NTIC s business, results of operations, and financial condition. 

21

Global credit and financial markets in the past have experienced disruptions, including diminished liquidity and credit availability and rapid fluctuations in market valuations, which, if they happen again, could negatively impact NTIC s business, operating results, and financial condition. 
 
 Any tightening of the credit and financial markets could negatively impact the ability of companies to borrow money from their existing lenders, obtain credit from other sources, or raise financing to fund their operations. This could negatively impact the ability of NTIC s customers and the customers of NTIC s joint ventures to purchase NTIC s products, suppliers ability to provide NTIC and its joint ventures with materials and components, and the ability of NTIC and its joint ventures, distributors, and sales representatives to finance operations, if needed, on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Any or all of these events could negatively impact NTIC s business, operating results, and financial condition. Although NTIC maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers, distributors, and joint ventures to make required payments, and such losses historically have been within NTIC s expectations and the provisions established, NTIC cannot guarantee that it will continue to experience the same loss rates that it has in the past, especially if there are weaknesses in the worldwide economy. A significant change in the liquidity or financial condition of NTIC s customers, distributors, or joint ventures could cause unfavorable trends in NTIC s receivable collections and additional allowances may be required, which could adversely affect NTIC s operating results. In addition, weaknesses in the worldwide economy, including the imposition of higher tariffs and withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, may adversely impact the ability of suppliers to provide NTIC with materials and components, which could adversely affect NTIC s business and operating results. NTIC is unable to predict the prospects for a global economic recovery, but the longer the duration of such adverse and uncertain economic conditions, the greater the risks NTIC faces in operating its business. 
 
 NTIC has limited staffing and will continue to be dependent upon key employees. 
 
 NTIC s success is dependent upon the efforts of a small management team and group of employees. NTIC s future success will depend in large part on its ability to retain its key employees and identify, attract, and retain other highly qualified managerial, technical, research and development, sales and marketing, and customer service personnel when needed. Competition for these individuals may be intense, especially in the markets in which NTIC operates. NTIC may not succeed in identifying, attracting, and retaining these personnel. Inadequate performance by any of NTIC s limited staff could have a negative impact on the performance of the company. In addition, none of NTIC s employees have any contractual obligation to maintain his or her employment with NTIC. The loss or interruption of services of any of NTIC s key personnel, including in particular its technical personnel, the inability to identify, attract, or retain qualified personnel in the future, delays in hiring qualified personnel, or any employee slowdowns, strikes, or similar actions could make it difficult for NTIC to manage its business and meet key objectives, which could harm NTIC s business, operating results, and financial condition. 
 
 Although we have not experienced any material labor shortage to date, we have recently observed an overall tightening and increasingly competitive labor market. A sustained labor shortage or increased turnover rates within our employee base, caused by COVID-19 or as a result of general macroeconomic factors, could lead to increased costs, such as increased overtime to meet demand and increased wage rates to attract and retain employees, and could negatively affect our ability to efficiently operate our manufacturing and distribution facilities and overall business. If we are unable to hire and retain employees capable of performing at a high-level, or if mitigation measures we may take to respond to a decrease in labor availability, such as overtime and third-party outsourcing, have unintended negative effects, our business could be adversely affected. An overall labor shortage, lack of skilled labor, increased turnover or labor inflation, caused by COVID-19 or as a result of general macroeconomic factors, could have a material adverse impact on NTIC s operations, results of operations, liquidity or cash flows. 
 
 NTIC faces challenges caused by its aging workforce, and NTIC may not be able to recruit, train and retain adequate replacements for its qualified and skilled employees. 
 
 Many of our employees are approaching retirement age. As these experienced employees retire, we may have difficulty recruiting new employees with comparable qualifications and experience, and we may be unable to transfer our employees institutional knowledge successfully to new qualified employees. Any such failures would be exacerbated at times of peak demand. Our failure to recruit and train new employees and to ensure they obtain the adequate qualifications and experience could result in reduced revenues, loss of customer goodwill and a material negative impact on our results of operations. 

22

Given NTIC s limited resources, it may not effectively manage its growth. 
 
 NTIC s strategy to grow its business, including in particular its ZERUST rust and corrosion inhibiting products for the oil and gas industry and its Natur-Tec bio-plastic resin compounds and finished products, requires significant management time and operational and financial resources. There is no assurance that NTIC has the necessary operational and financial resources to manage its growth. This is especially true as it expands facilities and manufactures its products on a larger commercial scale. In addition, rapid growth in NTIC s headcount and operations may place a significant strain on its management, administrative, operational, and financial infrastructure. Failure to adequately manage its growth could have a material and adverse effect on NTIC s business, operating results, and financial condition. For example, NTIC s soil side bottom solutions for tanks require implementation teams comprised of both internal NTIC personnel and outside consulting firms. NTIC s failure to expand these implementation teams to service additional customers may limit NTIC s ability to grow this business. In addition, NTIC may not be successful in its strategy to grow its business. 
 
 Risks Related to NTIC s Joint Ventures 
 
 NTIC s liquidity and financial position rely on the receipt of fees for services provided to its joint ventures and dividend distributions from its joint ventures. No assurance can be provided that NTIC will continue to receive such fees and dividend distributions in amounts NTIC historically has received or anticipates receiving. 
 
 NTIC conducts business, either directly or indirectly, through several joint venture arrangements that operate in North America, Europe, and Asia. Each of these joint ventures manufactures, markets, and sells finished products in the geographic territory that it is assigned. NTIC s receipt of funds as a result of sales by its joint ventures is dependent upon NTIC s receipt of fees for services that NTIC provides to its joint ventures based primarily on the net sales of the individual joint ventures and NTIC s receipt of dividend distributions from its joint ventures based on the profitability of its joint ventures. NTIC s liquidity and financial position in part rely on NTIC s receipt of fees for services that NTIC provides to its joint ventures and dividend distributions from its joint ventures. During fiscal 2021, NTIC recognized 5,964,260 in fees and 3,665,365 in dividend distributions from its joint ventures. Because NTIC owns 50 or less of each of its joint venture entities, NTIC does not control the decisions of these entities regarding whether to pay dividends and, if paid, how much they should be in any given year. Thus, NTIC cannot guarantee that any of its joint ventures will pay dividends in any given year. The failure of NTIC s joint ventures to declare dividends or the failure of NTIC to receive fees for services provided to joint ventures in amounts typically expected by NTIC could adversely affect NTIC s liquidity and financial position. 
 
 Since a significant portion of NTIC s earnings results from NTIC s equity income from joint ventures, and since NTIC s equity income from joint ventures varies from quarter to quarter, NTIC s earnings are subject to quarterly fluctuations. 
 
 A significant portion of NTIC s earnings results from NTIC s equity income from its joint ventures. NTIC s equity in income from joint ventures consists of NTIC s share of equity in income from its joint ventures based on the overall profitability of the joint ventures. Such profitability varies from quarter to quarter. Since NTIC s management typically receives quarterly joint venture financial information after the completion of each fiscal quarter, it is impossible for NTIC s management to cut costs and expenses to make up for any unanticipated shortfall in NTIC s equity income from joint ventures. Accordingly, the variability in NTIC s equity income from joint ventures, in turn, subjects NTIC s earnings to quarterly fluctuations. 
 
 Risks Related to NTIC s International Business and the Foreign Markets in which NTIC Operates 
 
 NTIC s international business, which is conducted primarily through its subsidiaries and joint ventures, requires management attention and financial resources and exposes NTIC to difficulties and risks presented by international economic, political, legal, accounting, and business factors. 
 
 NTIC sells products and services directly, through its wholly-owned and majority-owned subsidiaries, and indirectly, via a network of joint ventures, independent distributors, manufacturer s sales representatives, and agents in over 65 countries, including countries in North America, South America, Europe, Asia, and the Middle East. One of NTIC s strategic objectives is the continued expansion of its international operations. The expansion of NTIC s existing international operations and entry into additional international markets requires management attention and financial resources. 

23

The sale and shipping of products and services across international borders subjects NTIC to extensive and complicated U.S. and foreign governmental trade regulations. Compliance with such regulations is costly and exposes NTIC to penalties for non-compliance. Other laws and regulations that can significantly impact NTIC include various anti-bribery laws, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, laws restricting business with suspected terrorists, and anti-boycott laws. Any failure to comply with applicable legal and regulatory obligations could impact NTIC in a variety of ways that include, but are not limited to, significant criminal, civil, and administrative penalties, including imprisonment of individuals, fines and penalties, denial of export privileges, seizure of shipments, and restrictions on certain business activities. Also, the failure to comply with applicable legal and regulatory obligations could result in the disruption of NTIC s shipping and sales activities. 
 
 Several factors, including implications of withdrawal by the U.S. from, or revision to, international trade agreements, foreign policy changes between the U.S. and other countries, weakened international economic conditions, or the impact of sovereign debt defaults by certain European countries, could adversely affect our international net sales. Additionally, the expansion of our existing international operations and entry into additional international markets require significant management attention and financial resources. In many of the countries in which NTIC sells its products directly or indirectly through NTIC China, Zerust Brazil, Natur-Tec India, Natur-Tec Lanka, Zerust Mexico, Zerust Singapore, Zerust Vietnam and NTI Asean, its joint ventures, distributors, representatives, and agents are, to some degree, subject to political, economic, and/or social instability. NTIC s international operations expose NTIC and its joint venture partners, distributors, representatives, and agents to risks inherent in operating in foreign jurisdictions. These risks include: 

difficulties in managing and staffing international operations and the required infrastructure costs, including legal, tax, accounting, and information technology; 

the imposition of additional U.S. and foreign governmental controls or regulations, new trade restrictions, and restrictions on the activities of foreign agents, representatives, and distributors, the imposition of costly and lengthy export licensing requirements and changes in duties and tariffs, license obligations, and other non-tariff barriers to trade; 

the imposition of U.S. and/or international sanctions against a country, company, person, or entity with whom NTIC does business that would restrict or prohibit continued business with the sanctioned country, company, person, or entity; 

pricing pressure that NTIC or its joint ventures, distributors, representatives, and agents may experience internationally; 

laws and business practices favoring local companies; 

adverse currency exchange rate fluctuations; 

longer payment cycles and difficulties enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through certain foreign legal systems; 

national and international conflicts, including foreign policy changes or terrorist acts; 

difficulties in enforcing or defending intellectual property rights; 

multiple, changing, and often inconsistent enforcement of laws and regulations; and 

the potential payment of U.S. income taxes on certain earnings of joint ventures upon repatriation. 

Furthermore, in June 2016, the United Kingdom held a referendum in which voters approved an exit from the European Union, commonly referred to as Brexit. The United Kingdom officially terminated its membership of the European Union on January 31, 2020 and remained in a transition phase until December 31, 2020. The British government continues to negotiate the terms of the United Kingdom s future relationship with the European Union. Although it is unknown what those terms will be, or whether an agreement will be reached, it is possible that there will be increased regulatory complexities, which could affect NTIC s ability to sell its products in certain European Union countries. Brexit has created legal, political and economic uncertainty, which could subject NTIC to heightened risks in that region, including disruptions to trade and free movement of goods, services, and people to and from the United Kingdom, and increased foreign exchange volatility with respect to the British pound. NTIC does not know to what extent these changes will impact its business. Any of these effects of Brexit, and other similar referenda that NTIC cannot anticipate, could adversely affect its business, operations, and financial results. 

24

Out of NTIC s joint ventures, NTIC s joint venture in Germany is the most significant in terms of assets and income to NTIC. If sales of NTIC s products and services by this joint venture were to decline significantly or if NTIC s relationships with this joint venture were to deteriorate significantly, NTIC s operating results likely would be adversely affected. 
 
 NTIC considers its joint venture in Germany (EXCOR) to be individually significant to NTIC s consolidated assets and income and, therefore, provides certain additional information regarding EXCOR in the notes to NTIC s consolidated financial statements and in certain sections of this report, in addition to a few other entities for fiscal 2020. Of the total equity in income from joint ventures of 7,465,214 during fiscal 2021, NTIC had equity in income from joint ventures of 4,400,403 attributable to EXCOR. Of the total fee income for services provided to joint ventures of 5,964,260 during fiscal 2021, fees of 920,902 were attributable to EXCOR. Accordingly, if sales of NTIC s products and services by this joint venture were to decline significantly or if NTIC s relationships with this joint venture were to deteriorate significantly such that the joint venture terminated or was not motivated to sell NTIC s products and services, NTIC s operating results likely would be adversely affected. While this is also true with respect to the other joint venture entities of which additional information is provided in NTIC s consolidated financial statements and in certain other sections of this report, the significance is not as great as with EXCOR. 
 
 NTIC s recent acquisition of the remaining 50 ownership interest of Harita-NTI and any future similar acquisitions involve risk. 
 
 Effective as of September 1, 2021, NTIC acquired the remaining 50 ownership interest in its Indian joint venture, Harita-NTI. It is possible that as part of its succession planning efforts with respect to its joint venture partners that NTIC may complete similar acquisitions in the future. Similar future acquisitions will depend, in part, on the availability of similar opportunities or other suitable acquisition candidates at acceptable prices, terms, and conditions and the availability of capital and personnel resources to complete such acquisitions and run and integrate the acquired business effectively. These acquisitions involve risk and may harm NTIC s business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results. For instance, the benefits of the recent Harita-NTI acquisition or any future acquisition may take more time than expected to develop or integrate into NTIC s operations, and NTIC cannot guarantee that either the Harita-NTI or any future acquisitions will, in fact, produce any benefits. Acquisitions, including the recent Harita-NTI acquisition, involve a number of risks, the occurrence of which could adversely affect NTIC s business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results, including: 

diversion of management's attention to manage and integrate the acquired business; 

disruption to existing operations and plans; 

inability to effectively manage the expanded operations; 

difficulties or delays, which may be exacerbated by the impact of COVID-19, in integrating and assimilating information and financial systems, internal controls, operations, manufacturing processes and products of an acquired business or in realizing projected efficiencies, growth prospects, cost savings, and other synergies; 

potential loss of key employees, customers or suppliers of the acquired businesses or adverse effects on existing business relationships with employees, customers or suppliers; 

write-off of significant amounts of goodwill, other intangible assets, and/or long-lived assets as a result of deterioration in the performance of an acquired business, adverse market conditions, changes in the competitive landscape, changes in laws or regulations that restrict activities of an acquired business, or as a result of a variety of other circumstances; 

violation of confidentiality, intellectual property, and non-compete obligations or agreements by employees of an acquired business or lack of or inadequate formal intellectual property protection mechanisms in place at an acquired business; 

adverse impact on overall profitability if NTIC s expanded operations do not achieve the growth prospects, net sales, net earnings, cost and/or revenue synergies, or other financial results projected in NTIC s valuation models, delays in the realization thereof or costs or charges incurred to achieve any revenue or cost synergies; 

reallocation of amounts of capital from other operating initiatives and/or an increase in leverage and debt service requirements to pay acquisition purchase prices, which could in turn restrict NTIC s ability to access additional capital when needed or limit its ability to pursue other important elements of its business strategy; 

inaccurate assessment of additional post-acquisition, undisclosed, contingent or other liabilities or problems, unanticipated costs associated with an acquisition; and 

impacts as a result of purchase accounting adjustments, incorrect estimates made in the accounting for acquisitions, incurrence of non-recurring charges, or other potential financial accounting or reporting impacts. 

25

In addition, effective internal controls are necessary for NTIC to provide reliable and accurate financial reports and to effectively prevent fraud. The integration of acquired businesses may result in NTIC s systems and controls becoming increasingly complex and more difficult to manage. NTIC devotes significant resources and time to comply with the internal control over financial reporting requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. However, it cannot be certain that these measures will ensure that NTIC designs, implements, and maintains adequate control over its financial processes and reporting in the future, particularly in the context of acquisitions of other businesses. Any difficulties in the assimilation of acquired businesses into NTIC s internal control framework could harm its operating results or cause NTIC to fail to meet its financial reporting obligations. Also, acquisitions require the consent of PNC Bank, National Association under NTIC s loan agreement with PNC Bank. NTIC cannot predict whether such approvals would be forthcoming or the terms on which PNC Bank would approve such acquisitions. These risks, among others, could be heightened if NTIC completes a large acquisition or multiple transactions within a relatively short period of time. 
 
 The operations of NTIC China may be adversely affected by China s evolving economic, political, and social conditions. 
 
 The results of operations and future prospects of NTIC China may be adversely affected by, among other things, changes in China s political, economic, and social conditions, changes in the relationship between China and its western trade partners, changes in policies of the Chinese government, changes in laws and regulations or in the interpretation of existing laws and regulations, changes in foreign exchange regulations, measures that may be introduced to control inflation, such as interest rate increases, and changes in the rates or methods of taxation. In addition, changes in demand could result from increased competition with local Chinese manufacturers who have cost advantages or who may be preferred suppliers for Chinese end users. Also, Chinese commercial laws, regulations, and interpretations applicable to non-Chinese owned market participants, such as NTIC China, are continually changing. These laws, regulations, and interpretations could impose restrictions on NTIC s and NTIC China s ownership or operations or NTIC s interests in China and could adversely affect NTIC s business, results of operations, and financial condition. 
 
 Local regulations in China related to the recent electric power shortage may adversely affect NTIC China s operations. For example, these regulations could result in partial or complete factory shutdowns due to a lack of continuous supply of electrical power. Additionally, the price of electric power may be increased, and peak-demand periods during which prices are higher may be extended by local governments. Although NTIC China s operations have not been significantly impacted by regulations related to electric power shortages to date, such regulations may in the future decrease or shut down production or increase product costs, which could adversely affect NTIC s business, results of operations, and financial condition. 
 
 Intellectual property rights are difficult to enforce in China, which could harm NTIC s business, results of operations, or financial condition. 
 
 Chinese commercial law is relatively undeveloped compared to commercial law in many of NTIC s other major markets, and limited protection of intellectual property is available in China as a practical matter. Although NTIC takes precautions in the operation of NTIC China to protect NTIC s intellectual property, any local manufacturer of products that NTIC undertakes in China could subject NTIC to an increased risk that unauthorized parties will be able to copy or otherwise obtain or use NTIC s intellectual property, which could harm NTIC s business. NTIC may also have limited legal recourse in the event it encounters patent or trademark infringers, which could adversely affect NTIC s business, results of operations, and financial condition. 
 
 Uncertainties with respect to the Chinese legal system may adversely affect the operations of NTIC China. 
 
 NTIC China is subject to laws and regulations applicable to foreign investment in China. There are uncertainties regarding the interpretation and enforcement of laws, rules, and policies in China. The Chinese legal system is based on written statutes, and prior court decisions have limited precedential value. Because many laws and regulations are relatively new, and the Chinese legal system is still evolving, the interpretations of many laws, regulations, and rules are not always uniform. Moreover, the relative inexperience of China s judiciary in many cases creates additional uncertainty as to the outcome of any litigation, and the interpretation of statutes and regulations may be subject to government policies reflecting domestic political agendas. Finally, enforcement of existing laws or contracts based on existing law may be uncertain and sporadic. For the preceding reasons, it may be difficult for NTIC or NTIC China to obtain timely or equitable enforcement of laws ostensibly designed to protect companies like NTIC or NTIC China, which could adversely affect NTIC s business, results of operations, and financial condition. 

26

Failure to comply with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act could subject NTIC to, among other things, penalties and legal expenses that could harm its reputation and have a material adverse effect on its business, results of operations, and financial condition. 
 
 NTIC is subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or the FCPA, which generally prohibits covered entities and their intermediaries from engaging in bribery or making other prohibited payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or other benefits. In addition, the FCPA imposes accounting standards and requirements on U.S. publicly-traded corporations and their foreign affiliates, which are intended to prevent the diversion of corporate funds to the payment of bribes and other improper payments and to prevent the establishment of off books slush funds from which such improper payments can be made. NTIC also is subject to similar anticorruption legislation implemented in Europe under the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development s Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions. NTIC and its joint ventures, distributors, independent representatives, and agents operate in a number of jurisdictions that pose a high risk of potential violations of the FCPA and other anticorruption laws, based on measurements such as Transparency International s Corruption Perception Index, and NTIC utilizes a number of joint ventures, distributors, independent representatives, and agents for whose actions NTIC could be held liable under the FCPA. NTIC informs its personnel, joint ventures, distributors, independent representatives, and agents of the requirements of the FCPA and other anticorruption laws, including, but not limited to, their reporting requirements. NTIC also has developed and will continue to develop and implement systems for formalizing its contracting processes, performing due diligence on agents, and improving its recordkeeping and auditing practices regarding these regulations. However, there is no guarantee that NTIC s employees, joint ventures, distributors, independent representatives, or other agents have not or will not engage in conduct undetected by NTIC s processes and for which NTIC might be held responsible under the FCPA or other anticorruption laws. 
 
 If NTIC s employees, joint ventures, distributors, third-party sales representatives, or other agents are found to have engaged in such practices, NTIC could suffer severe penalties, including criminal and civil penalties, disgorgement, and other remedial measures, including further changes or enhancements to its procedures, policies, and controls and potential personnel changes and disciplinary actions. 
 
 Certain private and foreign companies, including some of NTIC s competitors, are not subject to prohibitions as strict as those under the FCPA or, even if subjected to strict prohibitions, such prohibitions may be laxly enforced in practice. If NTIC s competitors engage in corruption, extortion, bribery, pay-offs, theft, or other fraudulent practices, they may receive preferential treatment from personnel of some companies or from government officials, giving NTIC s competitors an advantage in securing business and putting NTIC at a disadvantage. 
 
 Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could result in declines in NTIC s earnings and changes in NTIC s foreign currency translation adjustments. 
 
 Because the functional currency of NTIC s foreign operations is the applicable local currency, NTIC is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk arising from transactions in the normal course of business. NTIC s principal exchange rate exposure is with the Euro, the Japanese Yen, the Indian Rupee, the Chinese Renminbi, the South Korean Won, and the English Pound against the U.S. dollar. NTIC s fees for services provided to its joint ventures and dividend distributions from these foreign entities are paid in foreign currencies; thus, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could result in declines in NTIC s earnings. Any changes in foreign currency exchange rates would be reflected as a foreign currency translation adjustment and would not change NTIC s equity in income from joint ventures reflected in its consolidated statements of operations. NTIC does not hedge against its foreign currency exchange rate risk. 
 
 Economic uncertainty in developing markets could adversely affect NTIC s revenue and earnings. 
 
 NTIC conducts business, or is contemplating expansion, in developing markets with economies that tend to be more volatile than those in the United States and Western Europe. The risk of doing business in developing markets such as China, Brazil, India, Russia, the United Arab Emirates, Mexico, and other economically volatile areas could adversely affect NTIC s operations and earnings. Such risks include the financial instability among customers in these regions, political instability, fraud or corruption, and other non-economic factors, such as the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and irregular trade flows that need to be managed successfully with the help of the local governments. In addition, commercial laws in some developing countries can be vague, inconsistently administered, and retroactively applied. If NTIC is deemed not to be in compliance with applicable laws in developing countries where NTIC conducts business, its prospects and business in those countries could be harmed, which could then have a material adverse impact on NTIC s operating results and financial position. NTIC s failure to successfully manage economic, political, and other risks relating to doing business in developing countries and economically and politically volatile areas could adversely affect its business. 

27

Risks Related to NTIC s Products 
 
 NTIC faces intense competition in almost all of its product lines, including from competitors that have substantially greater resources than NTIC does. No assurance can be provided that NTIC will be able to compete effectively, which would harm its business and operating results. 
 
 NTIC s products are sold in intensely competitive markets throughout the world. This intense competition could result in pricing pressures, lower sales, reduced margins, and lower market share. With respect to its rust and corrosion inhibiting products, NTIC competes on the basis of product innovation, quality, reliability, product support, customer service, reputation, and price. With respect to its Natur-Tec resin compounds and finished products, NTIC competes on the basis of performance, brand awareness, distribution network, product availability, product offering, shelf life, place of manufacture, and price. NTIC often competes with numerous manufacturers, many of which have substantially greater financial, marketing, and other resources than NTIC. As a result, they may be able to adapt more quickly than NTIC to new or emerging technologies, industry trends, and changes in customer requirements or to devote greater resources to the promotion and sale of their products than NTIC. In addition, competition could increase if new companies enter the markets in which NTIC competes, especially when the barriers to entry are low, which may be true with respect to NTIC s rust and corrosion prevention business, or if existing competitors expand their product lines or intensify efforts within existing product lines. NTIC s current products, products under development, and its ability to develop new and improved products may be insufficient to enable NTIC to compete effectively with its competitors. No assurance can be provided that NTIC will be able to compete effectively, which would harm its business and operating results. In particular, NTIC has experienced more intense competition with respect to many of its traditional ZERUST rust and corrosion inhibiting products and services, which has led to decreased pricing and smaller margins for NTIC. Recently, NTIC has experienced lower margins on its contracts with Chinese automotive customers. NTIC anticipates that such intense competition likely will continue and that new competitors may emerge, including plastic extrusion companies, which would continue to adversely affect NTIC s operating results. 
 
 NTIC s ZERUST rust and corrosion inhibiting products and services generate a significant portion of NTIC s net sales and the net sales of NTIC s joint ventures. Accordingly, if sales of these products and services were to decline, NTIC s operating results would be adversely affected. 
 
 NTIC s ZERUST rust and corrosion inhibiting products and services generate a significant portion of NTIC s net sales and the net sales of NTIC s joint ventures. During fiscal 2021, 80.6 of NTIC s consolidated net sales were derived from sales of ZERUST rust and corrosion inhibiting products and services. While the net sales of NTIC s joint ventures are not included in NTIC s net sales on NTIC s consolidated financial statements, NTIC s receipt of fees for services that NTIC provides to its joint ventures and NTIC s receipt of dividend distributions from its joint ventures are based primarily on the revenues and profitability of the joint ventures. Accordingly, if sales of these products and services were to decline due to increased competition, the introduction of a new disruptive technology, or otherwise, NTIC s operating results would be adversely affected. 
 
 If NTIC is unable to continue to enhance its existing products and develop and market new products that respond to customer needs and achieve market acceptance, NTIC may experience a decrease in demand for its products, and its business could suffer. 
 
 One of NTIC s strategies is to enhance its existing products and develop and market new products that respond to customer needs. NTIC may not be able to compete effectively with its competitors unless NTIC can keep up with existing or new products or alternative technologies in the markets in which it competes. Product development requires significant research and development, financial, and other resources. Although in the past NTIC has implemented lean manufacturing and other productivity improvement initiatives to provide investment funding for new products, no assurance can be provided that NTIC will be able to continue to do so in the future. Product improvements and new product introductions also require significant planning, design, development, and testing at the technological, product, and manufacturing process levels, and NTIC may not be able to timely develop product improvements or new products. NTIC s competitors new products may beat NTIC s products to market, may be more effective or less expensive than NTIC s products, or may render NTIC s products obsolete. Any new products that NTIC may develop may not receive market acceptance or otherwise generate any meaningful net sales or profits for NTIC relative to its expectations, based on, among other things, existing and anticipated investments in manufacturing capacity and commitments to fund advertising, marketing, promotional programs, and research and development. 

28

NTIC has invested and intends to continue to invest additional research and development and marketing efforts and resources into the application of its corrosion prevention solutions into the oil and gas industry and the continued launch of its Natur-Tec resin compounds and finished products. No assurance can be provided, however, that NTIC s investments in these new markets and products will be successful and result in additional revenue to NTIC. 
 
 In an effort to increase net sales, NTIC has expanded the marketing of its corrosion prevention solutions into the oil and gas industry and its Natur-Tec resin compounds and finished products. NTIC expects to continue to invest additional research and development and marketing efforts and resources into these strategic initiatives. No assurance can be provided, however, that such strategic initiatives will be successful or that NTIC will be successful in obtaining additional revenue as a result of them. The introduction of new products into new markets takes significant resources, and there can be no assurance that NTIC is dedicating a sufficient amount of resources to ensure the success of these strategic initiatives. The sale of NTIC s ZERUST rust and corrosion inhibiting products and services into the oil and gas industry, in particular, typically involves a long sales cycle, often including a one- to multi-year trial period with each customer and a slow integration process thereafter. This long sales cycle may cause NTIC s management, stockholders, and investors to lose faith in the business opportunities for NTIC s ZERUST rust and corrosion inhibiting products and services in the oil and gas industry. 
 
 NTIC s strategy of expanding its corrosion prevention solutions into the oil and gas industry and continuing the expansion of its Natur-Tec bioplastics resin compounds and finished products is risky and may not prove to be successful, which could harm NTIC s operating results and financial condition. 
 
 NTIC s strategy of expanding its corrosion prevention solutions into the oil and gas industry and continuing the expansion of its Natur-Tec bioplastics resin compounds and finished products, either directly or indirectly through joint ventures and independent distributors and agents, is risky and subject to all of the risks inherent in the establishment of a new business enterprise, including: 

the absence of a significant operating history; 

the lack of commercialized products; 

the lack of market acceptance of new products; 

expected substantial and continual losses for such businesses for the foreseeable future; 

the lack of manufacturing experience and limited marketing experience; 

an expected reliance on third parties for the manufacture and commercialization of some of the products; 

a competitive environment characterized by numerous, well-established and well-capitalized competitors; 

insufficient capital and other resources; and 

reliance on key personnel. 

NTIC s dependence on manufacturing and logistical services provided by contractors could give rise to product defect or warranty liability. 
 
 NTIC uses third-party manufacturers to produce the majority of its products. In addition, NTIC relies upon certain contractors for logistical services. Although NTIC s arrangements with its contract manufacturers and contractors may contain provisions for warranty expense reimbursement, NTIC may remain responsible to its customers for warranty service in the event of product defects and could experience an unanticipated product defect or warranty liability. In addition, product defects could harm NTIC s reputation amongst its customers. 

29

The commercial success of NTIC s Natur-Tec resin compounds and finished products depends on the widespread market acceptance of products manufactured with bio-based and biodegradable resins. 
 
 Although there is a developed market for petroleum-based plastics, the market for bioplastics which are plastics produced with bio-based resins, which are derived from renewable resources such as corn or cellulosic/plant material or blends thereof, or plastics that are engineered to be fully biodegradable or both, is still developing. The commercial success of NTIC s Natur-Tec resin compounds and finished products depends on the widespread market acceptance of products manufactured with bio-based and biodegradable resins. It is currently difficult to assess or predict with any assurance the potential size, timing, and viability of market opportunities for NTIC s Natur-Tec resin compounds and finished products. The traditional plastics market sector is well-established with entrenched competitors with whom NTIC competes. Pricing for traditional plastics has been highly volatile in recent years, which drives, to some extent, the commercial and other support for bioplastics. While NTIC expects to be able to command a premium price for its Natur-Tec resin compounds and finished products, a widening gap in the pricing for bioplastics versus petroleum-based plastics may reduce the size of the addressable market for NTIC s Natur-Tec resin compounds and finished products. In addition, the growth of the market will create some pressure on price for applications today considered commodities, including in particular NTIC s current Natur-Tec finished products. 
 
 NTIC relies on its joint ventures, distributors, manufacturer s sales representatives, and other agents to market and sell its products. 
 
 In addition to its direct sales force, NTIC relies on its joint ventures, distributors, manufacturer s sales representatives, and other agents to market and sell its products in the United States and internationally. NTIC s joint ventures, distributors, manufacturer s sales representatives, and other agents might terminate their relationship with NTIC or devote insufficient sales efforts to NTIC s products. NTIC does not control its joint ventures, distributors, manufacturer s sales representatives, and other agents, and they may not be successful in implementing NTIC s marketing plans. NTIC s failure to maintain its existing relationships with these entities, or its failure to recruit and retain additional skilled joint venture partners, distributors, manufacturer s sales representatives, and other agents, could have an adverse effect on NTIC s operations. It is anticipated that several of NTIC s joint venture partners will retire during the next several years, which will require a transition on the part of the joint venture as well as NTIC and could harm NTIC s relationship with the joint venture and NTIC s business. 
 
 NTIC may be subject to product liability claims or other claims arising out of the activities of its joint ventures, which could adversely affect NTIC and its business. 
 
 While NTIC is not aware of any specific potential risk beyond its initial investment in, and any undistributed earnings of, each of its joint ventures, there can be no assurance that NTIC will not be subject to lawsuits based on product liability claims or other claims arising out of the activities of its joint ventures. To mitigate the ramifications of such an occurrence, NTIC maintains liability insurance specifically applicable to its ownership positions in its joint venture arrangements in excess of any insurance the joint ventures may maintain. No assurance can be provided, however, that such insurance will be available or adequate in the event of a claim. 
 
 The sale of ZERUST rust and corrosion inhibiting products into the oil and gas industry is risky in light of the hazards typically associated with such operations and the significant amount of potential liability involved, which could adversely affect NTIC s business if ZERUST rust and corrosion inhibiting products are involved, even if the cause of such events was not related to NTIC s products. 
 
 Because NTIC sells its ZERUST rust and corrosion inhibiting products into the oil and gas industry, NTIC is subject to some of the risks and hazards typically associated with such operations, including hazards such as fire, explosion, blowouts, cratering, unplanned gas releases, and spills, each of which could be claimed to be attributed to the failure of NTIC s products to perform as anticipated. If such events occur and NTIC s products are involved, NTIC s business and operating results may suffer, even if the cause of such events was not related to NTIC s products. 
 
 The sale of ZERUST rust and corrosion inhibiting products into the oil and gas industry is somewhat seasonal and dependent upon oil prices. 
 
 In the past, NTIC has experienced some seasonality with respect to the sale of its ZERUST rust and corrosion inhibiting products into the oil and gas industry, with sales during parts of the second and third fiscal quarters being adversely affected by winter in the United States. In addition, the sale of NTIC s ZERUST rust and corrosion inhibiting products into the oil and gas industry, particularly in the United States, has been and may continue to be hampered by low global crude oil prices. Low global crude oil prices have recently been caused by oversupply, price wars between Saudi Arabia and Russia and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. NTIC believes low global crude oil prices constrain capital improvement budgets of its existing and prospective customers and may result in personnel turnover at its oil and gas customers or prospects. 

30

The expansion of NTIC s corrosion prevention solutions into the oil and gas industry and the continued launch of NTIC s Natur-Tec resin compounds and finished products may require additional capital in the future, which may not be available or may be available only on unfavorable terms. In addition, any equity financings may be dilutive to NTIC s stockholders. 
 
 The expansion of NTIC s corrosion prevention solutions into the oil and gas industry and the continued expansion of NTIC s Natur-Tec resin compounds and finished products will continue to require resources during fiscal 2022 and beyond. To the extent that NTIC s existing capital, including amounts available under its revolving line of credit, is insufficient to meet these requirements, NTIC may raise additional capital through financings or additional borrowings. Any equity or debt financing, if available at all, may be on terms that are not favorable to NTIC, and any equity financings could result in dilution to NTIC s stockholders. 
 
 Risks Related to Governmental Regulation, Laws, and Compliance 
 
 NTIC s business, properties, and products are subject to governmental regulation and taxes, compliance with which may require NTIC to incur expenses or modify its products or operations, and which may expose NTIC to penalties for non-compliance. Governmental regulation also may adversely affect the demand for some of NTIC s products and its operating results. 
 
 NTIC s business, properties, and products are subject to a wide variety of international, federal, state, and local laws, rules, taxes, and regulations relating to the protection of the environment, natural resources, and worker health and safety and the use, management, storage, and disposal of hazardous substances, wastes, and other regulated materials. These laws, rules, and regulations may affect the way NTIC conducts its operations, and the failure to comply with these regulations could lead to fines and other penalties. These laws, rules, and regulations may be subject to change by the Biden administration, which has stalled construction of the Keystone XL Pipeline and may in the future take action to further restrict such activities. Further, because NTIC owns and operates real property, various environmental laws also may impose liability on NTIC for the costs of cleaning up and responding to hazardous substances that may have been released on NTIC s property, including releases unknown to NTIC. These environmental laws and regulations also could require NTIC to pay for environmental remediation and response costs at third-party locations where NTIC disposed of or recycled hazardous substances. NTIC s future costs of complying with the various environmental requirements, as they now exist or may be altered in the future, could adversely affect NTIC s financial condition and operating results. NTIC is also subject to other international, federal, and state laws, rules, and regulations, the future non-compliance with which may harm NTIC s business or may adversely affect the demand for some of its products. Changes in laws and regulations, including changes in accounting standards and taxation changes, including tax rate changes, new tax laws, and revised tax law interpretations, also may adversely affect NTIC s operating results. 
 
 Fluctuations in NTIC s effective tax rate could have a significant impact on NTIC s financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. 
 
 The mix of pre-tax income or loss among the tax jurisdictions in which NTIC operates, which have varying tax rates, could impact NTIC s effective tax rate. NTIC is subject to income taxes as well as non-income based taxes in both the United States and various foreign jurisdictions. Judgment is required in determining the worldwide provision for income taxes, other tax liabilities, interest, and penalties. Future events could change management s assessment. NTIC operates within multiple taxing jurisdictions and is subject to tax audits in these jurisdictions. These audits can involve complex issues, which may require an extended period of time to resolve. NTIC also has made assumptions about the realization of deferred tax assets. Changes in these assumptions or jurisdictional regulations could result in a valuation allowance for these assets. Final determination of tax audits or tax disputes may be different from what is currently reflected by NTIC s income tax provisions and accruals. 

31

Certain of NTIC s operations are subject to regulation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. 
 
 The manufacture, sale, and use of NTIC s Natur-Tec bio-plastic resin compounds are subject to regulation by the U.S. FDA. The FDA s regulations are concerned with substances used indirectly in food packaging materials, not with specific finished food packaging products. Thus, food and beverage containers are in compliance with FDA regulations if the components used in the food and beverage containers: (i) are approved by the FDA as indirect food additives for their intended uses and comply with the applicable FDA indirect food additive regulations; or (ii) are generally recognized as safe for their intended uses and are of suitable purity for those intended uses. NTIC believes that its Natur-Tec resin compounds comply with all FDA requirements. However, failure to comply with FDA regulations could subject NTIC to administrative, civil, or criminal penalties. 
 
 NTIC s compliance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and any changes in such principles might adversely affect NTIC s operating results and financial condition. Any requirement to consolidate NTIC s joint ventures could adversely affect NTIC s operating results and financial condition. 
 
 If there were a change in accounting rules and NTIC were required to fully consolidate its joint ventures or if NTIC s joint ventures otherwise would be required to be consolidated with NTIC, NTIC and the individual joint venture would incur significant additional costs. In addition, other accounting pronouncements issued in the future could have a material cost associated with NTIC s implementation of such new accounting pronouncements. 
 
 Risks Related to NTIC s Intellectual Property 
 
 NTIC s reliance upon patents, trademark laws, trade secrets, and contractual provisions to protect its proprietary rights may not be sufficient to protect its intellectual property from others who may sell similar products. 
 
 NTIC holds patents relating to various aspects of its products and believes that proprietary technical know-how is critical to many of its products. Proprietary rights relating to NTIC s products are protected from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent that they are covered by valid and enforceable patents or are maintained in confidence as trade secrets. NTIC cannot be certain that it will be issued any patents from any pending or future patent applications owned by or licensed to NTIC or that the claims allowed under any issued patents will be sufficiently broad to protect its technology. In the absence of patent protection, NTIC may be vulnerable to competitors who attempt to copy NTIC s products or gain access to its trade secrets and know-how. NTIC s competitors may initiate litigation to challenge the validity of NTIC s patents, or they may use their resources to design comparable products that do not infringe NTIC s patents. NTIC may incur substantial costs if its competitors initiate litigation to challenge the validity of its patents or if it initiates any proceedings to protect its proprietary rights, and if the outcome of any such litigation is unfavorable to NTIC, its business and operating results could be materially adversely affected. 
 
 In addition, NTIC relies substantially on trade secrets and proprietary know-how that it seeks to protect, in part, by confidentiality agreements with its employees and consultants. These agreements may be breached, and NTIC may not have adequate remedies for any such breach. Even if these confidentiality agreements are not breached, NTIC s trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently developed by competitors. 
 
 Risks Related to NTIC s Common Stock 
 
 The trading volume of NTIC s common stock is typically very low, leaving NTIC s common stock open to risk of high volatility. 
 
 The number of shares of NTIC s common stock being traded daily is often very low, and on some trading days, there is no trading volume at all. During fiscal 2021, the daily trading volume ranged from 400 shares to 100,200 shares. Any NTIC stockholder wishing to sell his, her, or its stock may cause a significant fluctuation in the trading price of NTIC s common stock. In addition, low trading volume of a stock increases the possibility that, despite rules against such activity, the price of the stock may be manipulated by persons acting in their own self-interest. NTIC may not have adequate market makers and market making activity to prevent manipulation in its common stock. 

32

The price and trading volume of NTIC s common stock has been, and may continue to be, volatile. 
 
 The market price and trading volume of NTIC s common stock price historically has fluctuated over a wide range. During fiscal 2021, the sale price of NTIC s common stock ranged from a low of 7.79 per share to a high of 21.50 per share, and the daily trading volume ranged from 400 shares to 100,200 shares. It is likely that the price and trading volume of NTIC s common stock will continue to fluctuate in the future. The securities of small capitalization companies, including NTIC, from time-to-time experience significant price and volume fluctuations, often unrelated to the operating performance of these companies. Securities class action litigation is sometimes brought against a company following periods of volatility in the market price of its securities or for other reasons. NTIC may become the target of similar litigation, especially if NTIC fails to meet its annual projected financial guidance or lowers its annual projected financial guidance. Securities litigation, whether with or without merit, could result in substantial costs and divert management s attention and resources, which could harm NTIC s business, operating results, and financial condition as well as the market price of its common stock. 
 
 A large percentage of NTIC s outstanding common stock is held by insiders, and, as a result, the trading market for NTIC s common stock is not as liquid as the stock of other public companies. 
 
 As of November 15, 2021, NTIC had 9,187,446 shares of common stock outstanding, 23.5 of which were beneficially owned by directors, executive officers, principal stockholders, and their respective affiliates. The stock of companies with a substantial amount of stock held by insiders is usually not as liquid as the stock of other public companies where insider ownership is not as concentrated. Thus, the trading market for shares of NTIC s common stock may not be as liquid as the stock of other public companies. 
 
 If securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about NTIC s business, or if they adversely change their recommendations regarding NTIC s common stock, the market price for NTIC s common stock and trading volume could decline. 
 
 The trading market for NTIC s common stock has been influenced by research or reports that industry or securities analysts publish about NTIC or its business. If one or more analysts who cover NTIC downgrade NTIC s common stock, the market price for NTIC s common stock would likely decline. If one or more cease coverage of NTIC or fail to regularly publish reports on NTIC, NTIC could lose visibility in the financial markets, which, in turn, could cause the market price or trading volume for NTIC s common stock to decline. 
 
 One of NTIC s principal stockholders beneficially owns a significant percentage of NTIC s outstanding common stock and is affiliated with NTIC s President and Chief Executive Officer and, thus, may be able to influence matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors, and could discourage or otherwise impede a transaction in which a third-party wishes to purchase NTIC s outstanding shares at a premium. 
 
 As of November 15, 2021, Inter Alia Holding Company, or Inter Alia, beneficially owned approximately 13.1 of NTIC s outstanding common stock. Inter Alia is an entity partially owned by G. Patrick Lynch, NTIC s President and Chief Executive Officer and director, as well as two other members of the Lynch family. Mr. Lynch shares voting and dispositive power of shares of NTIC s common stock held by Inter Alia with the other owners. As a result of his share ownership through Inter Alia and his position as President and Chief Executive Officer and director of NTIC, Mr. Lynch may be able to influence the affairs and actions of NTIC, including matters requiring stockholder approval, such as the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions. The interests of Mr. Lynch and Inter Alia may differ from the interests of NTIC s other stockholders. This concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying, preventing, or deterring a change in control of NTIC, could deprive NTIC s stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their common stock as part of a sale or merger of NTIC, and may negatively affect the market price of NTIC s common stock. Transactions that could be affected by this concentration of ownership include proxy contests, tender offers, mergers, or other purchases of common stock that could give stockholders the opportunity to realize a premium over the then-prevailing market price for shares of NTIC s common stock. 

33

General Risk Factors 
 
 Climate change, or legal, regulatory, or market measures to address climate change, may negatively affect our business and operations. 
 
 Climate change resulting from increased concentrations of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere may have an adverse impact on global temperatures, weather patterns and the frequency and severity of extreme weather and natural disasters, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes, wildfires or flooding. Climate change may also cause water shortages, changes in rainfall and storm patterns, changes in sea levels and other negative weather and climate patterns. Such weather conditions could pose physical risks to our facilities and disrupt operation of our supply chain and may impact operational costs. 
 
 The increasing global focus on climate change and the need for corporate change also may lead to new regional, federal, and/or global legal and regulatory requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of greenhouse gases. Inconsistency of regulations in the countries in which we operate may affect the costs of compliance with such legal or regulatory requirements. Additionally, in the event that such regulation is enacted and is more aggressive than the sustainability measures that we are currently undertaking to monitor our emissions and improve our energy efficiently, we may be subject to curtailment or reduced access to resources or experience significant increases in our costs of operation and delivery. As a result, climate change could negatively affect our business and operations. 
 
 In addition, public company stockholders are increasingly sensitive to the climate change impacts and mitigation efforts of companies, are increasingly seeking enhanced disclosure on the risks, challenges, governance implications, and financial impacts of climate change faced by companies and are demanding that companies take a proactive approach to addressing perceived environmental risks, including risks associated with climate change, relating to their operations. Adverse publicity or climate-related litigation that impacts us could have a negative impact on our business. 
 
 Severe weather could have a material adverse effect on our business. 
 
 NTIC s business has been and could in the future be materially and adversely affected by severe weather. NTIC s customers, including in particular NTIC s oil and gas customers, may have operations located in parts of the southern United States or other places and may be adversely affected by hurricanes and tropical storms, resulting in reduced demand for NTIC s products and services or increased operating costs. Furthermore, NTIC s customers and raw material suppliers operations have been and could in the future be adversely affected by such hurricanes and other extreme or seasonal weather conditions. During fiscal year 2021, extreme weather caused supply chain disruptions and caused delays in receiving base resins. Adverse weather can also directly impede NTIC s operations. Repercussions of severe weather conditions may include: 

curtailment of services or reduced demand for products; 

weather-related damage to facilities and equipment, resulting in suspension of operations; 

inability to deliver equipment, personnel and products to job sites in accordance with contract schedules or increased transportation or other operating costs; and 

loss of productivity. 

These constraints could delay NTIC s operations and materially increase NTIC s operating and capital costs. 
 
 NTIC may grow its business through additional joint ventures, subsidiaries, alliances, and acquisitions, which could be risky and harm its business. 
 
 One of NTIC s growth strategies may be to expand its business by entering into additional joint ventures and alliances and acquiring businesses, technologies, and products that complement or augment NTIC s existing products. The benefits of a joint venture, alliance, or acquisition may take more time than expected to develop, and NTIC cannot guarantee that any future joint ventures, alliances, or acquisitions will in fact produce the intended benefits. In addition, joint ventures, alliances, and acquisitions involve a number of risks, including: 

34

diversion of management s attention; 

difficulties in assimilating the operations and products of a new joint venture or acquired business or in realizing projected efficiencies, cost savings, and revenue synergies; 

potential loss of key employees or customers of the new joint venture or acquired business or adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers; 

adverse impact on overall profitability if the new joint venture or acquired business does not achieve the financial results projected in NTIC s valuation models; 

reallocation of amounts of capital from other operating initiatives and/or an increase in NTIC s leverage and debt service requirements to pay the joint venture capital contribution or the acquisition purchase price, which could in turn restrict NTIC s ability to access additional capital when needed or to pursue other important elements of NTIC s business strategy; 

inaccurate assessment of undisclosed, contingent, or other liabilities or problems and unanticipated costs associated with the new joint venture or acquisition; and 

incorrect estimates made in the accounting for acquisitions, occurrence of non-recurring charges, and write-off of significant amounts of goodwill that could adversely affect NTIC s operating results. 

NTIC s ability to grow through joint ventures, alliances, and acquisitions will depend, in part, on the availability of suitable opportunities at an acceptable cost, NTIC s ability to compete effectively for these opportunities, and the availability of capital to complete such transactions. 
 
 NTIC relies on its management information systems for inventory management, distribution, and other functions. If these information systems fail to adequately perform these functions or if NTIC experiences an interruption in their operation, NTIC s business and operating results could be adversely affected. 
 
 The efficient operation of NTIC s business is dependent on its management information systems. NTIC relies on its management information systems to effectively manage accounting and financial functions; manage order entry, order fulfillment, and inventory replenishment processes; and to maintain its research and development data. The failure of management information systems to perform as anticipated could disrupt NTIC s business and product development and could result in decreased sales, causing NTIC s business and operating results to suffer. In addition, NTIC s management information systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from natural or man-made disasters, including terrorist attacks, attacks by computer viruses or hackers, power loss to computer systems, Internet outages, and telecommunications or data network failure. Any such interruption could adversely affect NTIC s business and operating results. 
 
 NTIC s business could be negatively impacted by cyber security threats. 
 
 In the ordinary course of NTIC s business, NTIC uses its management information systems to store and access proprietary business information. NTIC faces various cyber security threats, including cyber security attacks to its information technology infrastructure and attempts by others to gain access to its proprietary or sensitive information. The procedures and controls NTIC uses to monitor these threats and mitigate its exposure may not be sufficient to prevent cyber security incidents. The result of these incidents could include disrupted operations, lost opportunities, misstated financial data, liability for stolen assets or information, increased costs arising from the implementation of additional security protective measures, litigation, and reputational damage. Any remedial costs or other liabilities related to cyber security incidents may not be fully insured or indemnified by other means. 
 
 NTIC s quarterly results are typically unpredictable and subject to variation. 
 
 NTIC s quarterly operating results vary from quarter to quarter for a variety of reasons. For example, NTIC s quarterly sales to joint ventures can be affected by individual orders to joint ventures. Because of the typical size of individual orders to joint ventures and the overall size of NTIC s net sales to joint ventures, the timing of one or more orders can materially affect NTIC s quarterly sales to joint ventures and the comparisons to prior year quarters. In addition, because of the typical size of individual orders and the overall size of NTIC s net sales derived from sales of Natur-Tec products, the timing of one or more orders can materially affect NTIC s quarterly sales of Natur-Tec products and the comparisons to prior year quarters. Furthermore, since ZERUST products for the oil and gas industry typically carry higher margins than other traditional ZERUST products, the amount of sales of ZERUST products for the oil and gas industry typically affects NTIC s overall margins. Such variability in operating results makes the prediction of NTIC s net sales, earnings, and other operating results for each quarter difficult and increases the risk of unanticipated variations in quarterly operating results. NTIC s quarterly results have been and, in the future, may be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors. 

35

NTIC s business is subject to a number of other miscellaneous risks that may adversely affect NTIC s operating results, financial condition, or business. 
 
 NTIC s business is subject to a number of other miscellaneous risks that may adversely affect NTIC s operating results, and financial condition, such as natural or man-made disasters, an unexpected business loss of supply due to a force majeure event or global pandemics that may result in shortages of raw materials, higher commodity costs, an increase in insurance premiums, and other adverse effects on NTIC s business; the continued threat of terrorist acts and war that may result in heightened security and higher costs for import and export shipments of components or finished goods; and the ability of NTIC s management to adapt to unplanned events.

Business Overview 
 
 NTIC develops and markets proprietary, environmentally beneficial products and services in over 65 countries either directly or via a network of subsidiaries, joint ventures, independent distributors, and agents. NTIC s primary business is corrosion prevention, marketed mainly under the ZERUST brand. NTIC has been selling its proprietary ZERUST products and services to the automotive, electronics, electrical, mechanical, military, and retail consumer markets for over 45 years and, in recent years, has targeted and expanded into the oil and gas industry. NTIC also markets and sells a portfolio of bio-based and certified compostable (fully biodegradable) polymer resin compounds and finished products under the Natur-Tec brand. These products are intended to reduce NTIC s customers carbon footprint and provide environmentally sound waste disposal options. 

38

NTIC s ZERUST rust and corrosion inhibiting products include plastic and paper packaging, liquids, coatings, rust removers, cleaners, and diffusers as well as engineered solutions designed specifically for the oil and gas industry. NTIC also offers worldwide, on-site, technical consulting for rust and corrosion prevention issues. NTIC s technical service consultants work directly with the end users of NTIC s ZERUST rust and corrosion inhibiting products to analyze their specific needs and develop systems to meet their performance requirements. In North America, NTIC sells its ZERUST corrosion prevention solutions through a network of independent distributors and agents supported by a direct sales force. 
 
 Internationally, NTIC sells its ZERUST corrosion prevention solutions through its wholly-owned subsidiary in China, NTIC (Shanghai) Co., Ltd. (NTIC China), starting September 1, 2021 its wholly-owned subsidiary in India, Harita-NTI Ltd., its majority-owned joint venture holding company for NTIC s joint venture investments in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) region, NTI Asean LLC (NTI Asean), certain majority-owned and wholly-owned subsidiaries, and joint venture arrangements in North America, Europe, and Asia. NTIC also sells products directly to its European joint venture partners through its wholly-owned subsidiary in Germany, NTIC Europe GmbH (NTI Europe). 
 
 One of NTIC s strategic initiatives is to expand into and penetrate other markets for its ZERUST corrosion prevention technologies. Consequently, for the past several years, NTIC has focused significant sales and marketing efforts on the oil and gas industry, as the infrastructure that supports that industry is typically constructed using metals that are highly susceptible to corrosion. NTIC believes that its ZERUST corrosion prevention solutions will minimize maintenance downtime on critical oil and gas industry infrastructure, extend the life of such infrastructure, and reduce the risk of environmental pollution due to leaks caused by corrosion. 
 
 NTIC markets and sells its ZERUST rust and corrosion prevention solutions to customers in the oil and gas industry in a continuously increasing number of countries either directly, through its subsidiaries, or through its joint venture partners and other strategic partners. The sale of ZERUST corrosion prevention solutions to customers in the oil and gas industry typically involves long sales cycles, often including multi-year trial periods with each customer and a slow integration process thereafter. 
 
 Natur-Tec bio-based and compostable plastics are manufactured using NTIC s patented and/or proprietary technologies and are intended to replace conventional petroleum-based plastics. The Natur-Tec biopolymer resin compound portfolio includes formulations that have been optimized for a variety of applications, including blown-film extrusion, extrusion coating, injection molding, and engineered plastics. These resin compounds are certified to be fully biodegradable in a composting environment and are currently being used to produce finished products, including can liners, shopping and grocery bags, lawn and leaf bags, branded apparel packaging bags and accessories, and various foodservice items, such as disposable cutlery, drinking straws, food-handling gloves, and coated paper products. In North America, NTIC markets its Natur-Tec resin compounds and finished products primarily through a network of regional and national distributors as well as independent agents. NTIC continues to see significant opportunities for finished bioplastic products and, therefore, continues to strengthen and expand its North American distribution network for finished Natur-Tec bioplastic products. 
 
 Internationally, NTIC sells its Natur-Tec resin compounds and finished products both directly and through its wholly-owned subsidiary in China and majority-owned subsidiaries in India and Sri Lanka, and through distributors and certain joint ventures. 
 
 NTIC s Subsidiaries and Joint Venture Network 
 
 NTIC has ownership interests in 10 operating subsidiaries in North America, South America, Europe, and Asia, which are listed in Part I. Item 1. Business of this annual report on Form 10-K. The results of these subsidiaries are fully consolidated in NTIC s consolidated financial statements, except for Harita-NTI Limited, which will be consolidated commencing September 1, 2021. On September 21, 2021, NTIC announced that it acquired the remaining 50 ownership interest in its Indian joint venture, Harita-NTI Limited, for 6.25 million in cash, effective as of September 1, 2021. 
 
 NTIC participates in 19 active joint venture arrangements in North America, Europe, and Asia. NTIC has historically funded its investments in joint ventures with cash generated from operations. NTIC s receives funds from its joint ventures as fees for services that NTIC provides to its joint ventures and as dividend distributions. The fees for services provided to joint ventures are determined based on either a flat fee or a percentage of sales depending on local laws and tax regulations. With respect to NTIC s joint venture in Germany (EXCOR), NTIC recognizes an agreed upon quarterly fee for services. NTIC recognizes equity income from each joint venture based on the overall profitability of the joint venture. Such profitability is subject to variability from quarter to quarter, which, in turn, subjects NTIC s earnings to variability from quarter to quarter. The profits of each joint venture are shared by the respective joint venture owners in accordance with their respective ownership percentages. NTIC typically directly or indirectly owns 50 or less of each of its joint venture entities and, thus, does not control the decisions of these entities regarding whether to pay dividends and, if paid, what amount is paid in a given year. The payment of a dividend by an entity is determined by a joint vote of the owners and is not at the sole discretion of NTIC. 

39

NTIC accounts for the investments and financial results of its joint ventures in its financial statements utilizing the equity method of accounting. NTIC considers EXCOR to be individually significant to NTIC s consolidated assets and income as of August 31, 2021. NTIC considers EXCOR, ACOBAL SAS, ZERUST OY, ZERUST SPECIALTY TECH CO. LTD. and its former joint venture, Harita-NTI Limited, to be individually significant to NTIC s consolidated assets and income as of August 31, 2020. Therefore, NTIC provides certain additional information regarding these entities in the notes to NTIC s consolidated financial statements and in this section of this report. Additional information related to NTIC s joint ventures is available in Part I. Item 1. Business of this annual report on Form 10-K. 
 
 Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic 
 
 In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak a global pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted the global economy, disrupted global supply chains and shipping, created significant volatility and disruption in financial markets and has resulted in an economic recession. The outbreak and continuing rapid spread of COVID-19 has resulted in a substantial curtailment of business activities worldwide and is causing weakened economic conditions, both in the United States and abroad. 
 
 As part of efforts to contain the spread of COVID-19, federal, state, local and foreign governments imposed various restrictions on the conduct of business and travel, some of which remain in place in whole or in part and some of which have been or may be reinstated. Government restrictions, such as stay-at-home orders, quarantines and worker absenteeism as a result of COVID-19, led to a significant number of business closures and slowdowns. These business closures and slowdowns adversely impacted and may continue to adversely impact NTIC directly and caused some of NTIC s customers and suppliers to operate at a fraction of their capacities or wholly lock down, which disrupted and may continue to disrupt NTIC s sales and production. 
 
 As the events surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic unfolded, NTIC s primary focus was, and continues to be, the health, safety and wellbeing of its employees, customers and suppliers. In order to continue its operations, as permitted by respective state, local and foreign governments, NTIC has adopted numerous safety measures in accordance with U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, World Health Organization, and federal, state, local and foreign guidance in order to protect its employees, customers and suppliers. These safety measures include, but are not limited to, adhering to social distancing protocols, enabling the majority of its employees to work from home, suspending non-essential travel, disinfecting facilities and workspaces extensively and frequently, suspending all non-essential visitors and requiring employees who must be present at NTIC s facilities to wear face coverings. NTIC expects to continue such safety measures for the foreseeable future and may take further actions, or adapt these existing policies, as government authorities may require or recommend or as it may determine to be in the best interests of its employees, customers and suppliers. 
 
 NTIC has been balancing its safety-focused approach with the needs of its customers. Government mandated measures resulting in the substantial curtailment of business activities generally have excluded certain essential businesses and services, including certain manufacturing. With the exception of the temporary closures of NTIC s facilities in China and India during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and again sporadically during 2021, NTIC s manufacturing activities are generally considered part of the critical sector with respect to state and local government orders. This has allowed NTIC to continue to receive orders and provide uninterrupted order fulfillment to its customers. However, its facilities have been operating at a reduced capacity in order to abide by local government requirements and recommendations, such as social distancing practices, and in response to reduced demand. During fiscal 2021, certain of NTIC s facilities were impacted by reduced levels of production, manufacturing inefficiencies due to the reconfiguration of certain of its manufacturing processes in order to implement social distancing protocols and reduced demand. NTIC has engaged and continues to engage in communications with its suppliers in an attempt to identify and mitigate supply chain risks and shipping delays and proactively manage inventory levels in order to align production with demand. While domestic and international governmental measures may be modified or extended, NTIC currently expects that its global facilities will remain operational, although operating at reduced production capacity at certain of its facilities. However, such expectation is dependent upon future governmental actions and demand for NTIC s products, the stability of its global supply chain and the ability of carriers to transport supplies to its facilities and products to its customers. 

40

As a result of the global economic slowdown caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, NTIC experienced softened demand in various regions and markets during fiscal 2021, which had an adverse effect on NTIC s operating results and financial condition. In addition, NTIC has experienced supply shortages and price increase on raw materials which have adversely affected its margins. NTIC has also experienced increased shipping costs and shipping delays as a result of freight container shortages. These issues are expected to persist into fiscal 2022. Due to the international reach of COVID-19, NTIC s international joint ventures have also been adversely impacted. It is not possible to predict how long the pandemic will last or the time that it will take for economic activity to return to prior levels for all business units. 
 
 Any of these events could materially adversely affect NTIC s business, operating results and financial condition. 
 
 Worldwide Supply Chain Disruptions 
 
 Worldwide supply chain disruptions, which were initially brought about by the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, have persisted despite the recovery in the global economy and financial markets, and these issues are expected to continue in fiscal 2022. In fiscal 2021, NTIC experienced longer lead times for raw materials, was forced to find new suppliers of certain raw materials, and experienced raw material cost increases compared to prior fiscal years. Additionally, NTIC experienced significantly longer shipping times and significant price increases per shipping container compared to prior fiscal years due to ocean freight capacity issues resulting from increased demand for shipping and reduced capacity and equipment. These and other issues resulting from worldwide supply chain disruptions are expected to continue in fiscal 2022 and could continue to have a material adverse effect on NTIC s business, operating results and financial condition. The precise financial impact and duration, however, cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. 
 
 Financial Overview 
 
 NTIC s management, including its chief executive officer, who is NTIC s chief operating decision maker, reports and manages NTIC s operations in two reportable business segments based on products sold, customer base, and distribution center: ZERUST products and services and Natur-Tec products. 
 
 NTIC s consolidated net sales increased 18.6 during fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020. NTIC s consolidated net sales for fiscal 2021 were positively affected by increased demand globally as a result of the recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. During fiscal 2021, 80.6 of NTIC s consolidated net sales were derived from sales of ZERUST products and services, which increased 32.1 to 45,554,434 during fiscal 2021 compared to 34,474,535 during fiscal 2020. This increase was due to increased sales to new and existing customers in all countries in addition to the recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. During fiscal 2021, 19.4 of NTIC s consolidated net sales were derived from sales of Natur-Tec products compared to 27.6 during fiscal 2020. Net sales of Natur-Tec products decreased 16.9 to 10,939,385 during fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 primarily due to a decrease in finished product sales in North America and at NTIC s majority-owned subsidiary in India, Natur-Tec India Private Limited (Natur-Tec India). 
 
 Cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales decreased to 65.4 during fiscal 2021 compared to 66.4 during fiscal 2020 primarily as a result of a decreased percentage of product sales from Natur-Tec products, which have lower gross margins than NTIC s traditional ZERUST industrial products and services or its oil and gas products, partially offset by price increases on raw materials used in NTIC s products. 
 
 NTIC s equity in income from joint ventures increased 74.8 to 7,465,214 during fiscal 2021 compared to 4,270,327 during fiscal 2020. This increase was primarily due to a corresponding 39.0 increase in net sales at the joint ventures, which were 120,954,550 during fiscal 2021, compared to 87,030,062 during fiscal 2020. The majority of the increase in sales at the joint ventures is attributable to the increase in net sales at EXCOR, which were 46,522,688 during fiscal 2021, compared to 32,546,402 during fiscal 2020. The increase in the net sales of NTIC s joint ventures was due primarily to increased sales to existing customers as a result of increased demand for existing products. 
 
 NTIC s total operating expenses increased 1,355,173, or 5.8 , to 24,679,626 during fiscal 2021 compared to 23,324,453 during fiscal 2020. These increases were primarily due to increased expenses due to the resumption of travel and other activities as a result of the recovery associated with COVID-19 pandemic and increased research and development expenses. NTIC spent 4,400,479 in fiscal 2021 in connection with its research and development activities, compared to 3,979,455 in fiscal 2020. 

41

NTIC had net income attributable to NTIC of 6,281,238, or 0.64 per diluted common share, for fiscal 2021, compared to net loss attributable to NTIC of (1,337,709), or (0.15) per diluted common share, for fiscal 2020. This increase was primarily a result of increased demand globally as a result of the recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, although NTIC anticipates that its earnings may continue to be somewhat adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic during fiscal 2022. Additionally, NTIC anticipates that its quarterly net income or loss will continue to remain subject to significant volatility primarily due to the financial performance of its subsidiaries and joint ventures, sales of its ZERUST products and services into the oil and gas industry, and sales of its Natur-Tec bioplastics products, which fluctuate more on a quarterly basis than the traditional ZERUST business. 
 
 NTIC s working capital, defined as current assets less current liabilities, was 25,230,893 at August 31, 2021, including 7,680,641 in cash and cash equivalents and 4,634 in available for sale securities, compared to 27,104,746 at August 31, 2020, including 6,403,032 in cash and cash equivalents and 5,544,722 in available for sale securities. NTIC expects its working capital to decrease at the end of first quarter of fiscal 2022 as compared to August 31, 2021 due to the 6.25 million payment by NTIC for the remaining 50 ownership interest in Harita-NTI in September 2021. 
 
 During fiscal 2020, NTIC s Board of Directors declared cash dividends of 0.065 per share during its first and second quarters. On April 23, 2020, NTIC announced the temporary suspension of its quarterly cash dividend pending clarity on the financial impact of COVID-19 on NTIC. On January 15, 2021, NTIC announced the reinstatement of its quarterly cash dividend. During fiscal 2021, NTIC s Board of Directors declared cash dividends of 0.065 per share during its second, third and fourth quarters. On October 20, 2021, NTIC s Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of 0.07 per share of NTIC s common stock, payable on November 17, 2021 to stockholders of record on November 3, 2021. The declaration of future dividends is not guaranteed and will be determined by NTIC s Board of Directors in light of conditions then existing, including NTIC s earnings, financial condition, cash requirements, restrictions in financing agreements, business conditions, and other factors, including without limitation the effect of COVID-19 on its business, operating results, and financial condition. 
 
 Sales and Expense Components 
 
 The following is a description of the primary components of net sales and expenses: 
 
 Net Sales, Excluding Joint Ventures . NTIC derives net sales from the sale of its ZERUST products and services and its Natur-Tec products. NTIC sells its ZERUST products and services and its Natur-Tec products either directly, through its subsidiaries, or via a network of joint ventures, independent distributors, and agents. Net sales, excluding joint ventures represents net sales by NTIC either directly to end users or to distributors worldwide, but not sales to NTIC s joint ventures and not sales by NTIC s joint ventures. NTIC recognizes revenue from the sale of its products primarily upon shipment of the products. 
 
 Net Sales, To Joint Ventures . Net sales, to joint ventures represents net sales by NTIC to NTIC s joint ventures, but not sales by NTIC either directly to end users or to distributors or sales by NTIC s joint ventures. NTIC s revenue recognition policy for sales to its joint ventures is the same as NTIC s policy for sales to unaffiliated customers. NTIC recognizes revenue from the sale of its products to joint ventures primarily upon shipment of the products. 
 
 Cost of Goods Sold . Most of NTIC s products are manufactured by third parties, and its cost of goods sold for those products consists primarily of the price invoiced by its third-party vendors. For the portion of products that NTIC manufactures, NTIC s cost of goods sold for those products consists primarily of direct labor, allocated manufacturing overhead, raw materials, and components. NTIC s margins on its Natur-Tec resin compounds and finished products are generally smaller than its margins on its ZERUST products and services, and NTIC s margins on its ZERUST products and services sold into the oil and gas industry are generally greater than its margins on its traditional ZERUST products and services. 

42

Equity in Income from Joint Ventures . NTIC s equity in income from joint ventures consists of NTIC s share of equity in income from each joint venture based on the overall profitability of the joint ventures. Such profitability is subject to variability from quarter to quarter, which, in turn, subjects NTIC s earnings to variability from quarter to quarter. Traditionally, a portion of the equity income recorded in a given fiscal year is paid to the owners of the joint venture entity during the following fiscal year through a dividend. The payment of a dividend by a joint venture entity is determined by a vote of the joint venture owners and is not at the sole discretion of NTIC. NTIC typically owns only 50 or less of its joint venture entities and, thus, does not control the decisions of these entities regarding whether to pay dividends and, if paid, how much they should be in a given year. 
 
 Fees for Services Provided to Joint Ventures . NTIC provides certain services to its joint ventures, including consulting, legal, travel, insurance, technical, and marketing services based on licensing or other agreements with its joint ventures. NTIC receives fees for these services it provides to its joint ventures based primarily on the net sales by NTIC s joint ventures, the latter of which are not included in NTIC s net sales reflected on NTIC s consolidated statements of operations. The fees for services received by NTIC from its joint ventures are generally determined based on either a flat fee or a percentage of net sales by NTIC s joint ventures depending on local laws and tax regulations. With respect to EXCOR, NTIC receives an agreed upon fixed quarterly fee for such services. Under NTIC s agreements with its joint ventures in which the fees for services is described, amounts are earned when product is shipped from joint venture facilities, at which point a sale is deemed to have occurred and results in obligation of the joint venture to pay the royalty and recognition of the fee by NTIC. 
 
 Selling Expenses . Selling expenses consist primarily of sales commissions and support costs for NTIC s direct sale and distribution system and marketing costs. 
 
 General and Administrative Expenses . General and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits and other costs for NTIC s executives, accounting, stock-based compensation, finance, legal, information technology, and human resources functions. 
 
 Research and Development Expenses . Research and development expenses include costs associated with the design, development, market analysis, lab testing, and field trials and enhancements of NTIC s products and services. NTIC expenses all costs related to product research and development as incurred. Research and development expenses reflect the net amount after being reduced by reimbursements related to certain research and development contracts. With respect to such research and development contracts, NTIC accrues proceeds received under the contracts and offsets research and development expenses incurred in equal installments over the timelines associated with completion of the contracts specific objectives and milestones. 
 
 Interest Income . Interest income consists of interest earned on investments, which typically consist of investment-grade, interest-bearing securities and money market accounts. 
 
 Interest Expense . Interest expense results primarily from interest associated with any borrowings under NTIC s line of credit with PNC Bank. 
 
 Income Tax Expense . Income tax expense includes federal income taxes, foreign withholding taxes, income tax of consolidated entities in foreign jurisdictions, state income tax, and changes to NTIC s deferred tax valuation allowance. NTIC utilizes the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes, which requires an asset and liability approach to financial accounting and reporting for income taxes. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are computed annually for differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future, based on enacted tax laws and rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized. NTIC records a tax valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of its deferred tax assets will not be realized. NTIC makes this determination based on all available evidence, including historical data and projections of future results. Income tax expense is the tax payable or refundable for the period plus or minus the change during the period in deferred tax assets and liabilities.

NTIC s consolidated net sales to unaffiliated customers excluding NTIC s joint ventures increased 17.1 to 53,470,623 during fiscal 2021 compared to 45,666,045 during fiscal 2020. Net sales to joint ventures increased 53.3 to 3,023,196 during fiscal 2021 compared to 1,972,646 during fiscal 2020. These increases were primarily a result of increased demand globally as a result of the recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic.

During fiscal 2021, 80.6 of NTIC s consolidated net sales were derived from sales of ZERUST products and services, which increased 32.1 to 45,554,434 compared to 34,474,535 during fiscal 2020. NTIC has strategically focused its sales efforts for ZERUST products and services on customers with sizeable corrosion problems in industry sectors that offer sizable growth opportunities, including the oil and gas sector. Overall, demand for ZERUST products and services depends heavily on the overall health of the market segments to which NTIC sells its products, including the automotive, oil and gas, agriculture, and mining markets in particular. Beginning in fiscal 2021, the automotive industry experienced a microchip shortage that has decreased the production of vehicles. This decreased production has decreased demand for ZERUST products and services within the automotive industry. The microchip shortage and the corresponding decrease in the production of vehicles is anticipated to continue into fiscal 2022. The increase in NTIC s consolidated net sales derived from sales of ZERUST products and services was primarily a result of increased demand across all geographies, partially offset by decreased demand from the automotive industry.

32.1 

NTIC s total ZERUST net sales increased during fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 primarily due to overall increased demand for ZERUST industrial products and services. Overall demand for ZERUST products and services depends heavily on the overall health of the markets in which NTIC sells its products, including the automotive, oil and gas, agriculture, and mining markets in particular. 

44

ZERUST oil and gas net sales increased 36.3 during fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 primarily as a result of new opportunities with new customers, partially offset by reduced demand as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. NTIC anticipates that its sales of ZERUST products and services into the oil and gas industry will continue to remain subject to significant volatility from quarter to quarter as sales are recognized, specifically due to the volatility of oil prices. Demand for oil and gas products around the world depends primarily on market acceptance and the reach of NTIC s distribution network. Because of the typical size of individual orders and overall size of NTIC s net sales derived from sales of oil and gas products, the timing of one or more orders can materially affect NTIC s quarterly sales compared to prior fiscal year quarters. 
 
 During fiscal 2021, 19.4 of NTIC s consolidated net sales were derived from sales of Natur-Tec products, compared to 27.6 during fiscal 2020. Sales of Natur-Tec products decreased 16.9 to 10,939,385 during fiscal 2021 compared to 13,164,156 during fiscal 2020. The COVID pandemic has adversely impacted demand for Natur-Tec products from across the apparel industry, as well as many large users of bioplastics, including college campuses, stadiums, arenas, restaurants, and corporate office complexes. NTIC currently expects these customers will be some of the last businesses to fully re-open, and accordingly, anticipates that the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to significantly adversely affect sales of Natur-Tec products during fiscal 2022. 
 
 Cost of Goods Sold . Cost of goods sold increased 16.8 in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 primarily as a result of the increase in net sales, as described above. Cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales decreased to 65.4 during fiscal 2020 compared to 66.4 during fiscal 2020 primarily due to changes in product mix. Sales from Natur-Tec products have lower gross margins than NTIC s traditional ZERUST oil and gas products. This decrease was partially offset by price increases on raw materials used in NTIC s products. 
 
 Equity in Income from Joint Ventures . NTIC s equity in income from joint ventures increased 74.8 to 7,465,214 during fiscal 2021 compared to 4,270,327 during fiscal 2020. This increase was primarily a result of increased profitability of the joint ventures, which fluctuates based on net sales, during the fiscal 2021. Of the total equity in income from joint ventures, NTIC had equity in income from joint ventures of 4,400,403 attributable to EXCOR during fiscal 2021 compared to 2,622,423 attributable to EXCOR during fiscal 2020. NTIC had equity in income of all other joint ventures of 3,064,811 during fiscal 2021 compared to 1,647,904 during fiscal 2020. 
 
 Fees for Services Provided to Joint Ventures . NTIC recognized fee income for services provided to joint ventures of 5,964,260 during fiscal 2021 compared to 4,612,885 during fiscal 2020, representing an increase of 29.3 , or 1,351,375. Fee income for services provided to joint ventures is traditionally a function of the sales made by NTIC s joint ventures; however, at various joint ventures, the fee income for services is a fixed amount that does not fluctuate with the increases in sales which was experienced by certain joint ventures during fiscal 2021. Total net sales of NTIC s joint ventures increased 33,924,488 to 120,954,550 during fiscal 2021 compared to 87,030,062 during fiscal 2020, representing an increase of 39.0 . Net sales of NTIC s joint ventures are not included in NTIC s product sales and are not included in NTIC s consolidated financial statements. Of the total fee income for services provided to joint ventures, fees of 920,902 were attributable to EXCOR during fiscal 2021 compared to 843,752 attributable to EXCOR during fiscal 2020. 
 
 Selling Expenses . NTIC s selling expenses increased 12.8 in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 due primarily to increased travel expenses and personnel expense compared to the expenses incurred during fiscal 2020. Selling expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased to 21.3 for fiscal 2021 compared to 22.4 in fiscal 2020 primarily due to the fluctuations in net sales and selling expenses, as previously described. 
 
 General and Administrative Expenses . NTIC s general and administrative expenses decreased 4.9 in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 primarily due to decreased travel expenses and other expenses due to work from home arrangements necessitated by the COVID-19 pandemic. As a percentage of net sales, general and administrative expenses decreased to 14.6 for fiscal 2021 from 18.2 for fiscal 2020 primarily due to the decrease in general and administrative expenses, as well as the increase in net sales, as previously described. 
 
 Research and Development Expenses . NTIC s research and development expenses increased 10.6 in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 primarily due to increased personnel and development efforts, partially offset by decreased travel expenses and other expenses due to work from home arrangements necessitated by the COVID-19 pandemic. 

45

Interest Income . NTIC earned net interest income of 151,875 in fiscal 2021 compared to 167,733 in fiscal 2020 due primarily to volatile changes to the invested cash in a conservative bond fund. 
 
 Income Before Income Tax Expense . NTIC had income before income tax expense of 8,458,642 for fiscal 2021 compared to income before income tax expense of 1,739,875 for fiscal 2020. 
 
 Income Tax Expense . Income tax expense was 1,461,905 during fiscal 2021 compared to 2,674,635 during fiscal 2020 for an effective tax rate of 17.3 and 153.7 , respectively. Income tax expense during fiscal 2020 includes 1,626,251 related to the impact of a tax valuation allowance recorded with respect to NTIC s domestic deferred tax assets during fiscal 2020. 
 
 Net Income (Loss) Attributable to NTIC . Net income attributable to NTIC was 6,281,238, or 0.64 per diluted common share, for fiscal 2021 compared to a net loss attributable to NTIC of (1,337,709), or (0.15) per diluted common share, for fiscal 2020, an increase of 7,618,947 or 0.79 per diluted share. This increase was primarily the result of increased income from joint venture operations and increased gross profit during fiscal 2021. 
 
 NTIC anticipates that its earnings will be adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic throughout fiscal 2022 and that its quarterly net income or loss will continue to remain subject to significant volatility primarily due to the financial performance of its subsidiaries and joint ventures, sales of its ZERUST products and services into the oil and gas industry, and sales of its Natur-Tec bioplastics products, which fluctuate more on a quarterly basis than the traditional ZERUST business. 
 
 Other Comprehensive Income Foreign Currency Translations Adjustment . The changes in the foreign currency translations adjustment were due to the fluctuation of the U.S. dollar compared to the Euro and other foreign currencies during fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 Sources of Cash and Working Capital . As of August 31, 2021, NTIC s working capital, defined as current assets less current liabilities, was 25,230,893, including 7,680,641 in cash and cash equivalents and 4,634 in available for sale securities, compared to working capital of 27,104,746, including 6,403,032 in cash and cash equivalents and 5,544,722 in available for sale securities, as of August 31, 2020. The decrease in NTIC s working capital is primarily the result of the purchase of property and equipment partially offset by an increase of dividends received from joint ventures and the collection of outstanding receivables. 
 
 As of August 31, 2021, NTIC has a revolving line of credit with PNC Bank of 5.0 million, which was increased from 3.0 million effective as of August 31, 2021. No amounts were outstanding under the line of credit as of August 31, 2021. Outstanding advances under the line of credit bear interest at the daily London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus 250 basis points (2.50 ). The revolving line of credit matures on February 22, 2022. The line of credit is governed under an amended and restated loan agreement. The loan agreement contains standard covenants, including affirmative financial covenants, such as the maintenance of a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio, and negative covenants, which, among other things, limit the incurrence of additional indebtedness, loans and equity investments, disposition of assets, mergers and consolidations and other matters customarily restricted in such agreements. Under the loan agreement, NTIC is subject to a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.10:1.00. As of August 31, 2021, NTIC was in compliance with all debt covenants. As of August 31, 2021, NTIC did not have any letters of credit outstanding with respect to the letter of credit sub-facility available under the revolving line of credit with PNC Bank. 
 
 NTIC believes that a combination of its existing cash and cash equivalents, available for sale securities, forecasted cash flows from future operations, anticipated distributions of earnings, anticipated fees to NTIC for services provided to its joint ventures, and funds available through existing or anticipated financing arrangements will be adequate to fund its existing operations, investments in new or existing joint ventures or subsidiaries, capital expenditures, debt repayments, cash dividends, and any stock repurchases for at least the next 12 months. During fiscal 2022, NTIC expects to continue to invest directly and through its use of working capital in Harita NTI Limited, NTIC China, Zerust Mexico, NTI Europe, its joint ventures, research and development, marketing efforts, resources for the application of its corrosion prevention technology in the oil and gas industry, and its Natur-Tec bio-plastics business, although the amounts of these various investments are not known at this time. In order to take advantage of such new product and market opportunities to expand its business and increase its revenues, NTIC may decide to finance such opportunities by borrowing under its revolving line of credit or raising additional financing through the issuance of debt or equity securities. There is no assurance that any financing transaction will be available on terms acceptable to NTIC or at all or that any financing transaction will not be dilutive to NTIC s current stockholders.

NTIC traditionally has used the cash generated from its operations, distributions of earnings from joint ventures, and fees for services provided to its joint ventures to fund NTIC s new technology investments and capital contributions to new and existing subsidiaries and joint ventures. NTIC s joint ventures traditionally have operated with little or no debt and have been self-financed with minimal initial capital investment and minimal additional capital investment from their respective owners. Therefore, NTIC believes there is limited exposure by NTIC s joint ventures that could materially impact their respective operations and/or liquidity. 
 
 Uses of Cash and Cash Flow. Net cash provided by operating activities during fiscal 2021 was 2,892,940, which resulted principally from NTIC s net income, dividends received from joint ventures, stock-based compensation, depreciation, amortization and increases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities, partially offset by NTIC s equity in income from joint ventures and an increase in accounts receivable and prepaid expenses and other. Net cash provided by operating activities during fiscal 2020 was 4,912,070, which resulted principally from dividends received from joint ventures, stock-based compensation, depreciation, amortization and deferred income taxes, partially offset by NTIC s net loss, equity in income from joint ventures, and decreases in accrued liabilities and accounts payable. 
 
 NTIC s cash flows from operations are impacted by significant changes in certain components of NTIC s working capital, including inventory turnover and changes in receivables and payables. NTIC considers internal and external factors when assessing the use of its available working capital, specifically when determining inventory levels and credit terms of customers. Key internal factors include existing inventory levels, stock reorder points, customer forecasts, and customer requested payment terms. Key external factors include the availability of primary raw materials and sub-contractor production lead times. NTIC s typical contractual terms for trade receivables, excluding joint ventures, are traditionally 30 days and 90 days for trade receivables from its joint ventures. Before extending unsecured credit to customers, excluding NTIC s joint ventures, NTIC reviews customers credit histories and will establish an allowance for uncollectible accounts based upon factors surrounding the credit risk of specific customers and other information. Accounts receivable over 30 days are considered past due for most customers. NTIC does not accrue interest on past due accounts receivable. If accounts receivables in excess of the provided allowance are determined uncollectible, they are charged to selling expense in the period that the determination is made. Accounts receivable are deemed uncollectible based on NTIC exhausting reasonable efforts to collect. NTIC s typical contractual terms for receivables for services provided to its joint ventures are 90 days. NTIC records receivables for services provided to its joint ventures on an accrual basis, unless circumstances exist that make the collection of the balance uncertain, in which case the fee income will be recorded on a cash basis until there is consistency in payments. This determination is handled on a case-by-case basis. 
 
 NTIC experienced an increase in trade receivables and an increase in inventory as of August 31, 2021 compared to August 31, 2020. Trade receivables, excluding joint ventures, as of August 31, 2021 increased 3,056,593 compared to August 31, 2020, primarily related to an increase in sales. 
 
 Outstanding trade receivables, excluding joint ventures balances, as of August 31, 2021 increased by an average of 11 days to an average of 76 days from balances outstanding from these customers as of August 31, 2020. 
 
 Outstanding trade receivables from joint ventures as of August 31, 2021 increased 148,908 compared to August 31, 2020 primarily due to the timing of payments. Outstanding balances from trade receivables from joint ventures decreased by an average of 13 days as of August 31, 2021 to an average of 75 days from an average of 88 days from balances outstanding from these customers compared to August 31, 2020. The average days outstanding of trade receivables from joint ventures as of August 31, 2021 were primarily due to the receivable balances at NTIC s joint ventures in Indonesia, Thailand and India. 
 
 Outstanding receivables for services provided to joint ventures as of August 31, 2021 increased 577,841 compared to August 31, 2020, and the average days to pay increased from an average of 73 days to an average of 92 days, compared to August 31, 2020. 
 
 Net cash used in investing activities during fiscal 2021 was 103,316, which was primarily the result of the purchase of available for sale securities, purchases of property and equipment and investments in patents, partially offset by proceeds from the sale of available for sale securities. Net cash used in investing activities during fiscal 2020 was 2,784,682, which was primarily the result of the purchase of available for sale securities, purchases of property and equipment and investments in patents, partially offset by proceeds from the sale of available for sale securities. 

47

Net cash used in financing activities for fiscal 2021 was 1,522,209, which resulted from dividends paid on NTIC common stock and dividends paid to a non-controlling interest, partially offset by proceeds from NTIC s employee stock purchase plan and proceeds from stock option exercises. Net cash used in financing activities for fiscal 2020 was 1,518,005, which resulted from dividends paid on NTIC common stock and a dividend paid to a non-controlling interest, partially offset by proceeds from NTIC s employee stock purchase plan. 
 
 Share Repurchase Plan . On January 15, 2015, NTIC s Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to 3,000,000 in shares of NTIC common stock through open market purchases or unsolicited or solicited privately negotiated transactions. This program has no expiration date but may be terminated by NTIC s Board of Directors at any time. As of August 31, 2021, up to 2,640,548 in shares of NTIC common stock remained available for repurchase under NTIC s stock repurchase program. No shares of NTIC common stock were repurchased during fiscal 2021 or fiscal 2020.

On April 23, 2020, NTIC announced the temporary suspension of its quarterly cash dividend pending clarity on the financial impact of COVID-19 on NTIC. Therefore, NTIC s Board of Directors did not declare a cash dividend during the quarter ended May 31, 2020, the quarter ended August 31, 2020, or the quarter ended November 30, 2020. On January 15, 2021, NTIC announced the reinstatement of its quarterly cash dividend. 
 
 The declaration of future dividends is not guaranteed and will be determined by NTIC s Board of Directors in light of conditions then existing, including NTIC s earnings, financial condition, cash requirements, restrictions in financing agreements, business conditions, and other factors, including without limitation the effect of COVID-19 on its business, operating results, and financial condition. 
 
 Capital Expenditures and Commitments . NTIC spent 5,532,750 on capital expenditures during fiscal 2021, which related primarily to the purchase of real estate, a building and equipment in China. On July 7, 2021, NTIC (Shanghai) Co., Ltd., a wholly-owned subsidiary of NTIC, entered into a Real Estate Purchase and Sales Contract with Shanghai FASTO Investment Group Limited Company, pursuant to which NTIC (Shanghai) Co., Ltd. agreed to acquire an approximately 1,950 square meter industrial building and the right to use certain real estate in the Qingpu District of Shanghai, China for a purchase price of approximately RMB 32.6 million yuan (approximately USD 5.1 million), not including approximately RMB 10 million yuan (approximately USD 1.6 million) in anticipated renovation, equipment, transaction and other costs and expenses. The property will be used as the new corporate headquarters of NTIC (Shanghai) Co., Ltd. 

48

NTIC expects to spend an aggregate of approximately 2,200,000 to 2,500,000 on capital expenditures during fiscal 2022, which it expects will relate primarily to anticipated renovation and equipment costs, as described above.

Inflation and Seasonality 
 
 Inflation in the United States and abroad historically has had little effect on NTIC. Although NTIC s business historically has not been seasonal, NTIC believes there is now some seasonality in its business. NTIC believes its net sales in the second fiscal quarter were adversely affected by the long Chinese New Year, the North American holiday season, and overall less corrosion taking place at lower winter temperatures worldwide. 
 
 Market Risk 
 
 NTIC is exposed to some market risk stemming from changes in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, and interest rates. 
 
 Because the functional currency of NTIC s foreign operations and investments in its foreign joint ventures is the applicable local currency, NTIC is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk arising from transactions in the normal course of business. NTIC s principal exchange rate exposure is with the Euro, the Japanese Yen, the Indian Rupee, the Chinese Renminbi, the South Korean Won, and the English Pound against the U.S. Dollar. NTIC s fees for services provided to joint ventures and dividend distributions from these foreign entities are paid in foreign currencies and, thus, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could result in declines in NTIC s reported net income. Since NTIC s investments in its joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method, any changes in foreign currency exchange rates would be reflected as a foreign currency translation adjustment and would not change NTIC s equity in income from joint ventures reflected in its consolidated statements of operations. NTIC does not hedge against its foreign currency exchange rate risk. 
 
 Some raw materials used in NTIC s products are exposed to commodity price changes. The primary commodity price exposures are with a variety of plastic resins. 
 
 Any outstanding advances under NTIC s 5,000,000 amended and restated revolving line of credit with PNC Bank bear interest at an annual rate based on daily LIBOR plus 2.50 . As of August 31, 2021, NTIC had no borrowings under the line of credit. This line of credit was increased from 3,000,000 to 5,000,000 effective as of August 31, 2021. 
 
 Related Party Transactions 
 
 Since NTIC s joint ventures are considered related parties, NTIC recorded sales to its joint ventures as a separate line item on the face of NTIC s consolidated statements of operations and recorded fees for services provided to its joint ventures as separate line items on the face of NTIC s consolidated statements of operations. NTIC also records trade receivables from joint ventures, receivables for fees for services provided to joint ventures, and NTIC s investments in joint ventures as separate line items on its consolidated balance sheets. 
 
 NTIC established its joint venture network approximately 30 years ago as a method to increase its worldwide distribution network for ZERUST rust and corrosion inhibiting products and services. NTIC participates, either directly or indirectly, in 18 active joint venture arrangements in North America, Europe, and Asia. Each of these joint ventures generally manufactures and markets finished products in the geographic territory to which it is assigned. NTIC s joint venture partners are knowledgeable in the applicable environmental, labor, tax, and other requisite regulations and laws of the respective foreign countries in which they operate, as well as the local customs and business practices. NTIC s revenue recognition policy for sales to its joint ventures is the same as its policy for sales to unaffiliated customers. 

49

The fees for services provided to joint ventures are determined based on either a flat fee or a percentage of sales depending on local laws and tax regulations. With respect to NTIC s joint venture in Germany, EXCOR, NTIC recognizes an agreed upon quarterly fee for such services. NTIC records revenue related to fees for services provided to joint ventures when earned, amounts are determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured. Under NTIC s agreements with its joint ventures, fee amounts are earned when product is shipped from joint venture facilities. NTIC reviews the financial situation of each joint venture to assist in the likelihood of collections on amounts earned. From time to time, NTIC elects to account for such fees on a cash basis for certain joint ventures when uncertainty exists surrounding the collections of such fees. There are no fees being accounted for in this manner at present. The expenses incurred in support of its joint ventures are direct expenses that NTIC incurs related to its joint ventures and include such items as employee compensation and benefit expenses, travel expense, insurance, consulting expense, legal expense, and lab supplies and testing expense. 
 
 See Note 13 to NTIC s consolidated financial statements for other related party transaction disclosures. 
 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 
 NTIC does not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which are established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet financial arrangements. As such, NTIC is not materially exposed to any financing, liquidity, market, or credit risk that could arise if NTIC had engaged in such arrangements. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 
 The preparation of NTIC s consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. The Securities and Exchange Commission has defined a company s most critical accounting policies as those that are most important to the portrayal of its financial condition and results of operations and those which require the company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. Based on this definition, NTIC has identified the following critical accounting policies. Although NTIC believes that its estimates and assumptions are reasonable, they are based upon information available when they are made. Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 
 
 Principles of Consolidation 
 
 NTIC evaluates its voting and variable interests in entities on a qualitative and quantitative basis. NTIC consolidates entities in which it concludes it has the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact an entity s economic success and has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could be significant to the entity. All such relationships are evaluated on an ongoing basis. The consolidated financial statements included in this report include the accounts of Northern Technologies International Corporation, its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Northern Technologies Holding Company, LLC, NTIC (Shanghai) Co., Ltd., NTIC Europe GmbH and ZERUST-EXCOR MEXICO, S. de R.L. de C.V., NTIC s majority-owned subsidiary in Brazil, Zerust Preven o de Corros o S.A., NTIC s majority-owned holding company, NTI Asean LLC, and NTIC s majority-owned subsidiary in India, Natur-Tec India Private Limited, Natur-Tec Lanka, Zerust Singapore Pte Ltd (Zerust Singapore) and Zerust Vietnam Co. Ltd (Zerust Vietnam). NTIC s consolidated financial statements do not include the accounts of any of its joint ventures. Effective as of September 1, 2021, Harita-NTI Limited will be consolidated in NTIC s consolidated financial statements. 
 
 Investments in Joint Ventures and Recoverability of Investments in Joint Ventures 
 
 NTIC s investments in its joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method. NTIC assesses its joint ventures for impairment on an annual basis as of August 31 of each year as part of its fiscal year end analysis. In addition to the annual review for impairment, NTIC reviews the operating results of each joint venture on a quarterly basis in comparison to its historical operating results and its accrual for fees for services provided to joint ventures. If the operating results of a joint venture do not meet NTIC s financial performance expectations, an additional evaluation is performed on the joint venture. In addition to the annual assessments for impairment, non-periodic assessments for impairment may occur if cash remittances are less than accrued balances, a joint venture s management requests capital, or other events occur suggesting anything other than temporary decline in value. If an investment were determined to be impaired, then a reserve would be created to reflect the impairment on the financial results of NTIC. NTIC s evaluation of its investments in joint ventures requires NTIC to make assumptions about future cash flows of its joint ventures. These assumptions require significant judgment, and actual results may differ from assumed or estimated amounts. 

50

Investment at Carrying Value 
 
 If NTIC is no longer able to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policy of a joint venture previously accounted for under the equity method, it maintains the investment at the carrying value as of the date that significant influence no longer exists and discontinues accruing the proportionate earnings or losses of the investment. 
 
 Investments are considered to be impaired when a decline in fair value is judged to be other-than-temporary. Fair value is calculated based on publicly available market information or other estimates determined by management. NTIC employs a systematic methodology on a quarterly basis that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of its investments. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, NTIC evaluates, among other factors, general market conditions, credit quality of debt instrument issuers, the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost, and for equity securities, its intent and ability to hold, or plans to sell, the investment. NTIC also considers specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the investee, including industry and sector performance, changes in technology, and operational and financing cash flow factors. Once a decline in fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary, an impairment charge is recorded to other income (expense), and a new cost basis in the investment is established. 
 
 Revenue Recognition 
 
 Revenue is measured based on consideration specified in the contract with a customer, adjusted for any applicable estimates of variable consideration and other factors affecting the transaction price, including noncash consideration, consideration paid or payable to customers, and significant financing components. While most of NTIC s revenue is contracted with customers through one-time purchase orders and short-term contracts, NTIC does have long-term arrangements with certain customers. Revenue from all customers is recognized when a performance obligation is satisfied by transferring control of a distinct good or service to a customer. The transaction price for NTIC s products is the invoiced amount. Revenue is recognized when transfer of control occurs as defined by the terms in the customer agreement, generally upon shipment of product. 
 
 With respect to recording revenue related to fees earned for services provided to NTIC s joint ventures, amounts are earned when product is shipped from joint venture facilities, at which point a sale is deemed to have occurred and results in obligation for the joint venture to pay the royalty and recognition of the fee by NTIC. The support and services NTIC provides its joint ventures include consulting, travel, insurance, technical and marketing services to existing joint ventures, legal fees incurred in the establishment of new joint ventures, registration and promotion and legal defense of worldwide trademarks, and legal fees incurred in connection with the filing of patent applications based on licensing or other agreements with its joint ventures. NTIC receives fees for the services it provides to its joint ventures based primarily on the net sales by NTIC s joint ventures. The fees for support services received by NTIC from its joint ventures are generally determined based on either a flat fee or a percentage of net sales by NTIC s joint ventures depending on local laws and tax regulations. Under NTIC s agreements with its joint ventures, amounts are earned when product is shipped from joint venture facilities. NTIC reviews the financial situation of each of its joint ventures to assist in the likelihood of collections on amounts earned. NTIC elects to account for these fees on a cash basis for certain joint ventures when uncertainty exists surrounding the collections of such fees. 
 
 Accounts Receivable 
 
 Trade receivables arise from sales of NTIC s products and services to NTIC s joint ventures and to unaffiliated customers. Trade receivables from joint ventures arise from sales NTIC makes to its joint ventures of products and the essential additives required to make ZERUST industrial corrosion inhibiting products functional. Receivables for services to NTIC s joint ventures are contractually based primarily on a percentage of the sales of the joint ventures and are intended to compensate NTIC for services NTIC provides to its joint ventures, including consulting, legal, travel, insurance, technical, and marketing services. 

51

Payment terms for NTIC s unaffiliated customers are determined based on credit risk and vary by customer. NTIC typically offers standard payment terms of net 30 days to unaffiliated customers. Payment terms for NTIC s joint ventures also are determined based on credit risk; however, additional consideration is given to the individual joint venture due to the transportation time associated with ocean delivery of most products and certain other factors. NTIC typically offers payment terms to joint ventures of net 90 days. NTIC does not accrue interest on past due accounts receivable. NTIC reviews the credit histories of its customers, including its joint ventures, before extending unsecured credit. NTIC values accounts and notes receivable net of an allowance for doubtful accounts. Each quarter, NTIC prepares an analysis of its ability to collect outstanding receivables that provides a basis for an allowance estimate for doubtful accounts. In doing so, NTIC evaluates the age of its receivables, past collection history, current financial conditions of key customers and its joint ventures, and economic conditions. Based on this evaluation, NTIC establishes a reserve for specific accounts and notes receivable that it believes are uncollectible, as well as an estimate of uncollectible receivables not specifically known. Deterioration in the financial condition of any key customer or joint venture or a significant slowdown in the economy could have a material negative impact on NTIC s ability to collect a portion or all of the accounts and notes receivable. NTIC believes that an analysis of historical trends and its current knowledge of potential collection problems provide NTIC with sufficient information to establish a reasonable estimate for an allowance for doubtful accounts. However, since NTIC cannot predict with certainty future changes in the financial stability of its customers or joint ventures, NTIC s actual future losses from uncollectible accounts may differ from its estimates. In the event NTIC determined that a smaller or larger uncollectible accounts reserve is appropriate, NTIC would record a credit or charge to selling expense in the period that it made such a determination. 
 
 Recoverability of Long-Lived Assets 
 
 NTIC reviews its long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable and determines potential impairment by comparing the carrying value of the assets with expected net cash flows expected to be provided by operating activities of the business or related products. If the sum of the expected undiscounted future net cash flows were less than the carrying value, NTIC would determine whether an impairment loss should be recognized. An impairment loss would be measured by comparing the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset. 
 
 Foreign Currency Translation (Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss) 
 
 The functional currency of each international joint venture and subsidiary is the applicable local currency. The translation of the applicable foreign currencies into U.S. dollars is performed for balance sheet accounts using exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date and for revenue and expense accounts using an average monthly exchange rate. Translation gains or losses are reported as an element of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). 
 
 NTIC (excluding NTIC China, Zerust Brazil, Natur-Tec India, Natur-Tec Lanka, NTI Asean, Zerust Singapore, Zerust Vietnam, Zerust Mexico, NTI Europe, and NTIC s joint ventures) conducts all foreign transactions based on the U.S. dollar. Since NTIC s investments in its joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method, any changes in foreign currency exchange rates would be reflected as a foreign currency translation adjustment and would not change the equity in income from joint ventures reflected in NTIC s consolidated statements of operations. 
 
 Stock-Based Compensation 
 
 NTIC recognizes compensation cost relating to share-based payment transactions, including grants of employee stock options and transactions under NTIC s employee stock purchase plan, in its consolidated financial statements. That cost is measured based on the fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued. NTIC measures the cost of employee services received in exchange for stock options or other stock-based awards based on the grant-date fair value of the award and recognizes the cost over the period the employee is required to provide services for the award. 

52

Inventory Valuation 
 
 NTIC s inventories consist primarily of production materials and finished goods. NTIC purchases production materials and finished goods based on forecasted demand and records inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is determined by the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method. Management regularly assesses inventory valuation based on current and forecasted usage, demand and pricing, shelf life, customer inventory-related contractual obligations, and other considerations. If actual results differ from management estimates with respect to the actual or projected selling of inventories at amounts less than their carrying amounts, NTIC would adjust its inventory balances accordingly. 
 
 Income Taxes 
 
 NTIC utilizes the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the consolidated financial statements. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in operations in the period that includes the enactment date. 
 
 NTIC records net deferred tax assets to the extent NTIC believes these assets will more likely than not be realized. In making such a determination, NTIC considers all available positive and negative evidence, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax-planning strategies, and results of recent operations, including the prior three-year history. In the event NTIC determines that it would be able to realize its deferred income tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded amount, NTIC makes an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance, which would reduce the provision for income taxes.

Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 
 NTIC is exposed to some market risk stemming from changes in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, and interest rates. 
 
 Because the functional currency of NTIC s foreign operations and investments in its foreign joint ventures is the applicable local currency, NTIC is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk arising from transactions in the normal course of business. NTIC s principal exchange rate exposure is with the Euro, the Japanese Yen, the Indian Rupee, the Chinese Renminbi, the South Korean Won, and the English Pound against the U.S. Dollar. NTIC s fees for services provided to joint ventures and dividend distributions from these foreign entities are paid in foreign currencies, and, thus, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could result in declines in NTIC s reported net income. Since NTIC s investments in its joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method, any changes in foreign currency exchange rates would be reflected as a foreign currency translation adjustment and would not change NTIC s equity in income from joint ventures reflected in its consolidated statements of operations. NTIC does not hedge against its foreign currency exchange rate risk. 
 
 Some raw materials used in NTIC s products are exposed to commodity price changes. The primary commodity price exposures are with a variety of plastic resins. 
 
 Any outstanding advances under NTIC s 5,000,000 amended and restated revolving line of credit with PNC Bank bear interest at an annual rate based on daily LIBOR plus 2.50 . As of August 31, 2021, NTIC had no borrowings under the line of credit. This line of credit was increased from 3,000,000 to 5,000,000 effective as of August 31, 2021.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

To the shareholders and the board of directors of 
 Northern Technologies International Corporation and Subsidiaries: 
 
 Opinion on the Financial Statements 
 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Northern Technologies International Corporation and Subsidiaries (the "Company") as of August 31, 2021 and 2020, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), equity, and cash flows, for each of the two years in the period ended August 31, 2021, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the "consolidated financial statements"). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of August 31, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended August 31, 2021, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
 
 Basis for Opinion 
 
 These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) ("PCAOB") and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 
 
 Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 
 Critical Audit Matters 
 
 Critical audit matters are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. We determined that there are no critical audit matters. 

/s/ Baker Tilly US, LLP 
 
 We have served as the Company's auditor since 2004.

countries either directly or via a network of joint ventures, independent distributors, and agents. The Company s primary business is corrosion prevention marketed mainly under the ZERUST brand. The Company has been selling its proprietary ZERUST rust and corrosion inhibiting products and services to the automotive, electronics, electrical, mechanical, military, and retail consumer markets for over 45 years and, more recently, has targeted and expanded into the oil and gas industry. The Company also sells a portfolio of bio-based and certified compostable (fully biodegradable) polymer resin compounds and finished products under the Natur-Tec brand. These products are intended to reduce the Company s customers carbon footprint and provide environmentally sound disposal options. The Company s two operating segments are ZERUST and Natur-Tec. 
 
 The Company participates, either directly or indirectly, in active joint venture arrangements in North America, Europe, and Asia. Each of these joint ventures generally manufactures and markets products in the geographic territory to which it is assigned. While most of the Company s joint ventures exclusively sell rust and corrosion inhibiting products, some of the joint ventures also sell the Company s Natur-Tec resin compounds and finished products. The profits of joint ventures are shared by the respective joint venture owners in accordance with their respective ownership percentages. The Company typically owns or less of its joint venture entities and does not control the decisions of these entities, including dividend declaration or amount in any given year. 
 
 Impact of COVID- 19 Pandemic In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the novel coronavirus (COVID- 19 outbreak a global pandemic. As a result of the COVID- 19 pandemic and related government mandated restrictions on the Company s business as well as the businesses of its joint ventures, customers and suppliers, disruption to the Company s business and the manufacture and sale of its products and services has occurred and is expected to continue into fiscal 2022. In fiscal year 2021, the Company was impacted by shipping issues, including freight container shortages, shipping delays, and increased costs, and supply chain issues, including longer lead times and raw material cost increases. 
 
 ownership interest of Harita-NTI effective as of September 1, 2021. 
 
 of Natur-Tec India, of Natur Tec Lanka, of Zerust Brazil, of NTI Asean, of Zerust Singapore Pte Ltd, and of Zerust Vietnam Co. Ltd. The remaining ownership of the consolidated entities are accounted for as non-controlling interests and reported as part of equity in the consolidated financial statements. The Company allocates gains and losses to the non-controlling interest even when such allocation results in a deficit balance, reducing the losses attributed to the controlling interest. Changes in ownership interests are treated as equity transactions if the Company maintains control. 

The transaction price for the Company s products is the invoiced amount. The Company does not have variable consideration in the form of refunds, credits, rebates, price concessions, pricing incentives, or other items impacting transaction price. The purchase order pricing in arrangements with customers is deemed to approximate standalone selling price; therefore, the Company does not need to allocate proceeds on a relative standalone selling price allocation between performance obligations. The Company applies the practical expedient in paragraph 606 - 10 - 50 - 14 and does not disclose information about remaining performance obligations that have original expected durations of one year or less. There are no material obligations that extend beyond one year. 
 
 Revenue is recognized when transfer of control occurs, as defined by the terms in the customer agreement. The Company immediately recognizes incidental items that are immaterial in the context of the contract. The Company has applied the practical expedient in paragraph 606 - 10 - 25 - 16A and does not assess if immaterial items are promised goods or services. The Company has also applied the practical expedient in paragraph 606 - 10 - 32 - 18 regarding the adjustment of the promised amount of consideration for the effects of a significant financing component when the customer pays for that good or service within one year or less, as the Company does not have any significant financing components in its customer arrangements since payment is received at or shortly after the point of sale, generally thirty to ninety days. 
 
 The Company estimates returns based on an analysis of historical experience if the right to return products is granted to its customers. The Company does not record a return asset, as non-conforming products are generally not returned. The Company s return policy does not vary by geography. The customer has no rotation or price protection rights, and the Company is not under a warranty obligation. 
 
 Sales Commissions Sales commissions paid to sales representatives are eligible for capitalization, as they are incremental costs that would not have been incurred without entering into a specific sales arrangement and are recoverable through the expected margin on the transaction. The Company has elected to apply the practical expedient provided by ASC 340 - 40 - 25 - 4 and recognize the incremental costs of obtaining contracts as an expense when incurred, as the amortization period of the assets that would have otherwise been recognized is one year or less. The Company records these costs as a selling expense. 
 
 Product Warranty The Company offers warranties on various products and services. These warranties are assurance type warranties that are not sold on a standalone basis; therefore, they are not considered distinct performance obligations. The Company estimates the costs that may be incurred under its warranties and records a liability in the amount of such costs at the time the revenue is recognized for the product sale. 
 
 International Revenue The Company markets its products to numerous countries in North America, Europe, Latin America, Asia, and other parts of the world. See Note 11, Segment and Geographical Information, for information regarding revenue disaggregation by geography. 
 
 as of August 31, 2021 and as of August 31, 2020. Accounts are considered past due based on terms agreed upon between the Company and the customer. Accounts receivable are written-off only after all collection attempts have failed and are based on individual credit evaluation and specific circumstances of the customer. 

If the Company is no longer able to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policy of a joint venture previously accounted for under the equity method, it maintains the investment at the carrying value as of the date that significant influence no longer exists and discontinues accruing the proportionate earnings or losses of the investment. 
 
 Investments are considered to be impaired when a decline in fair value is judged to be other-than-temporary. Fair value is calculated based on publicly available market information or other estimates determined by management. The Company employs a systematic methodology on a quarterly basis that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, the Company evaluates, among other factors, general market conditions, credit quality, the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost, and for equity securities, the Company s intent and ability to hold, or plans to sell, the investment. The Company also considers specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the investee, including industry and sector performance, changes in technology, and operational and financing cash flow factors. Once a decline in fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary, an impairment charge is recorded to other income (expense), and a new cost basis in the investment is established.

The dilutive impact summarized above relates to the periods when the average market price of the Company s common stock exceeded the exercise price of the potentially dilutive option securities granted. Net income per common share was based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the periods when computing the basic net income per share. When dilutive, stock options are included as equivalents using the treasury stock market method when computing the diluted net income per share. Excluded from the computation of diluted net income per share as of August 31, 2021 were options outstanding to purchase shares of common stock.

shares. Subject to adjustment as provided in the 2019 Plan, up to a maximum of shares of the Company s common stock are issuable under the 2019 Plan. Options granted generally have a term of ten years and become exercisable over a one - or three - year period beginning on the one -year anniversary of the date of grant. Options are granted at per share exercise prices equal to the market value of the Company s common stock on the date of grant. The Company issues new shares upon the exercise of options. During the fiscal years ended August 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company granted stock options under the 2019 Plan to purchase an aggregate of and shares of its common stock to various employees and directors, respectively. As of August 31, 2021, shares of common stock remained available under the 2019 Plan. 

The maximum number of shares of common stock of the Company available for issuance under the ESPP is shares, subject to adjustment as provided in the ESPP. The ESPP provides for six -month offering periods beginning on September 1 and March 1 of each year. The purchase price of the shares is of the lower of the fair market value of common stock at the beginning or end of the offering period. This discount may not exceed the maximum discount rate permitted for plans of this type under Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. The ESPP is compensatory for financial reporting purposes. The Company issued and shares on March 1, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and and shares on September 1, 2020 and 2019, respectively, under the ESPP. As of August 31, 2021, shares of common stock remained available for sale under the ESPP. 
 
 The fair value of option grants is determined at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the assumptions listed below. The volatility factor used in the Black-Scholes option pricing model is based on historical stock price fluctuations, and the risk-free interest rate is based on U.S. treasury rates appropriate for the expected term. Dividend yield and expected volatility are estimated using historical amounts that are anticipated to be consistent with current values. Expected life of the option is based on the life of the option agreements. Based on these valuations, the Company recognized compensation expense of and during fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020, respectively, related to the options that vested during such time. As of August 31, 2021, the total compensation cost for non-vested options not yet recognized on the Company s consolidated statements of operations was , which is expected to be recognized during fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2023, based on outstanding options as of August 31, 2021. Future option grants will impact the compensation expense recognized. Stock-based compensation expense is included in general and administrative expense on the consolidated statements of operations. 
 
 The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the grant date using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions and results for the grants: 

Expected volatility 
 Expected life of option (in years)

The Company has not provided U.S. income taxes or foreign withholding taxes with respect to its portion of the cumulative undistributed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries and joint ventures that are essentially permanent in duration. As a result of the 2017 tax law changes, U.S. federal income taxes on dividends received from the Company s foreign subsidiaries and joint ventures after December 31, 2017 have been generally eliminated. However, the Company continues to be subject to foreign withholding taxes upon repatriation of any undistributed earnings that are not essentially permanent in duration. The Company recorded a tax expense of approximately and tax benefit of approximately during fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020, respectively, representing changes in the deferred tax liability for foreign withholding taxes to be paid with respect to the portion of the cumulative undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries and joint ventures that the Company determined were not essentially permanent in duration.

As of August 31, 2020, the Company had foreign tax credit carryforwards of of which expired during August 31, 2021. The remaining of foreign tax credit carryforwards as of August 31, 2021 will begin to expire if not utilized prior to August 31, 2022. In addition, the Company had federal and state tax credit carryforwards of as of August 31, 2021, which began to expire in fiscal 2022. These federal and state tax credit carryforwards consist primarily of federal and Minnesota research and development credit carryforwards. The Company also has a deferred tax asset of for federal net operating loss carryforwards and for state net operating loss carryforwards as of August 31, 2021. The federal net operating loss carryforward has an indefinite carryforward period. The state net operating loss carryforward will begin to expire if not utilized prior to August 31, 2022. The Company has a deferred tax asset of for foreign net operating loss carryforwards, of which has an indefinite carryforward period. 
 
 The Company records a tax valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of its deferred tax assets will not be realized. 
 
 The Company determined based on all available evidence, including historical data and projections of future results, that it is more likely than not that its domestic deferred tax assets will not be realized due to the absence of objectively verifiable sources of taxable income. On the basis of this evaluation, the Company has recorded a valuation allowance of and as of August 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, to recognize only the portion of the deferred tax assets that is more likely than not to be realized. The net deferred tax asset as of August 31, 2021 and 2020 relates entirely to non-US deferred tax assets which are expected to be realized by offset of deferred tax liability for withholding tax on cumulative undistributed earnings in foreign subsidiaries and joint ventures that the Company determined were not essentially permanent. The change in the valuation allowance totaled a decrease of and an increase of for the years ended August 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. 

The following is a tabular reconciliation of the total amounts of approximated unrecognized tax benefits: 

Gross increases prior period tax positions 
 Gross increases current period tax positions 
 Gross unrecognized tax benefits ending balance 

The entire amount of unrecognized tax benefits would affect the effective tax rate if recognized. It is not expected that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits will change significantly in the next 12 months. 
 
 The Company recognizes interest related to unrecognized tax benefits and penalties as income tax expense. Accrued interest and penalties are included within the related tax liability line in the consolidated balance sheet. There was liability for the payment of interest and penalties as of both August 31, 2021 and August 31, 2020. 
 
 The Company is subject to taxation in the United States and various states and foreign jurisdictions. With few exceptions, as of August 31, 2021, the Company is no longer subject to federal, state, local, or foreign examinations by tax authorities for years prior to August 31, 2018.

As of August 31, 2021, the weighted-average remaining lease term was years. The Company s lease agreements do not provide a readily determinable implicit rate nor is it available to the Company from its lessors. Instead, as of August 31, 2021, the Company estimates the weighted-average discount rate for its operating leases to be to present value based on the incremental borrowing rate.

 Annual Bonus Plan 
 
 On August 26, 2021, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company approved the material terms of an annual bonus plan for the Company s executive officers as well as certain officers and employees for the fiscal year ending August 31, 2022. For fiscal 2022, as in past years, the total amount available under the bonus plan for all plan participants, including executive officers, is dependent upon the Company s earnings before interest, taxes, and other income, as adjusted to take into account amounts to be paid under the bonus plan and certain other adjustments (Adjusted EBITOI). Each plan participant s percentage of the overall bonus pool is based upon the number of plan participants, the individual s annual base salary, and the individual s position and level of responsibility within the company. In the case of each of the Company s executive officer participants, of the amount of their individual bonus payout will be determined based upon the Company s actual EBITOI for fiscal 2022 compared to a pre-established target EBITOI for fiscal 2022, and of the payout will be determined based upon such executive officer s achievement of certain pre-established individual performance objectives. The payment of bonuses under the plan is discretionary, and bonuses may be paid to executive officer participants in both cash and shares of NTIC common stock, the exact amount and percentages of which were determined by the Company s Board of Directors, upon recommendation of the Compensation Committee, after the completion of the Company s consolidated financial statements for fiscal 2022.

This is compared to recognized for bonuses for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2020, of the bonus comprised of stock options granted to management on September 1, 2019 and was paid out in cash and profit sharing subsequent to year end. 

Concentrations 
 
 Two joint ventures (consisting of the Company s joint ventures in the Thailand and Indonesia) accounted for of the Company s trade joint venture receivables as of August 31, 2021, and five joint ventures (consisting of the Company s joint ventures in the United States, Indonesia, Philippines, Russia and India) accounted for of the Company s trade joint venture receivables as of August 31, 2020. 
 
 Legal Matters 
 
 From time to time, the Company is subject to various claims and legal actions in the ordinary course of its business. The Company records a liability in its consolidated financial statements for costs related to claims, including future legal costs, settlements, and judgments, where the Company has assessed that a loss is probable, and an amount could be reasonably estimated. If the reasonable estimate of a probable loss is a range, the Company records the most probable estimate of the loss or the minimum amount when no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount. The Company discloses a contingent liability even if the liability is not probable or the amount is not estimable, or both, if there is a reasonable possibility that material loss may have been incurred. In the opinion of management, as of August 31, 2021, the amount of liability, if any, with respect to these matters, individually or in the aggregate, will not materially affect the Company s consolidated results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.

Assets and Liabilities That Are Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis 
 
 Assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis primarily relate to marketable equity securities. These items are marked-to-market at each reporting period, and the Company estimates that market value approximates costs. 
 
 The following tables provide information by level for assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis: 

Valuation Techniques 
 
 Financial assets that are classified as Level 1 securities include cash equivalents and available for sale securities. These are valued using quoted market prices in an active market. 
 
 The Company reviews the fair value hierarchy classification on a quarterly basis. Changes in the ability to observe valuation inputs may result in a reclassification of levels for certain securities within the fair value hierarchy. The Company s policy is to recognize transfers into and out of levels within the fair value hierarchy at the end of the fiscal quarter in which the actual event or change in circumstances that caused the transfer occurs. There were no transfers between Level 1, Level 2, or Level 3 during the fiscal years ended August 31, 2021 or August 31, 2020. When a determination is made to classify an asset or liability within Level 3, the determination is based upon the significance of the unobservable inputs to the overall fair value measurement.

Although NTIC s Board of Directors intends to declare regular quarterly cash dividends going forward, the payment of any future dividends will be determined by NTIC s Board of Directors in light of conditions then existing, including NTIC s earnings, financial condition, cash requirements, restrictions in financing agreements, business conditions, and other factors, including without limitation the effect of COVID- 19 on its business, operating results, and financial condition. 
 
 On September 21, 2021, the Company announced that it acquired the remaining ownership interest in its Indian joint venture, Harita-NTI Limited, for USD million in cash, effective as of September 1, 2021. This purchase was funded with cash available from existing operations.

The other material terms of the line of credit, Amended and Restated Loan Agreement and Amended and Restated Security Agreement with PNC Bank and other related documents were not affected by these amendments.

 Item 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 NTIC maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by NTIC in the reports it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to NTIC s management, including NTIC s principal executive officer and principal financial officer, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. NTIC s management evaluated, with the participation of its Chief Executive Officer and its Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness of the design and operation of NTIC s disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered in this report. Based on that evaluation, NTIC s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that NTIC s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of such period to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in the reports that NTIC files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to NTIC s management, including NTIC s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 
 Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 NTIC s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) for Northern Technologies International Corporation and its subsidiaries. This system is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 
 
 The Company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements, and even when determined to be effective, can only provide reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. In addition, projection of any evaluation of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting to future periods is subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
 
 Management, with the participation of NTIC s President and Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of August 31, 2021. In making this evaluation, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013). Based on this assessment, management concluded that the Company's internal control over financial reporting was effective as of August 31, 2021.
