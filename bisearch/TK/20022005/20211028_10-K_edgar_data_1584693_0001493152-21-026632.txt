ITEM
1. BUSINESS. 

Overview 

Healthcare
Integrated Technologies, Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively the Company, we, our or us is a healthcare technology company based in Knoxville, Tennessee. We are creating a diversified spectrum of healthcare technology solutions
to integrate and automate the continuing care, home care and professional healthcare spaces. 

Our
initial product, SafeSpace with AI Vision , is an ambient fall detection solution designed for continuing care communities
and at home use. SafeSpace includes hardware devices utilizing RGB, radar and other sensor technology coupled with our internally developed
software to effectively monitor a person remotely. In continuing care communities, SafeSpace detects resident falls and generates alerts
to a centralized, intelligent dashboard without the use of wearable devices or any action by the resident. In the home, SafeSpace detects
falls and sends alerts directly to designated individuals. 

In
addition to SafeSpace, we are creating a home concierge healthcare service application to provide a virtual assisted living experience
for seniors, recently released postoperative patients and others. The concierge application will enable the consumer to obtain home healthcare
services and health and safety monitoring equipment to improve quality of life. We are also working to develop a fully integrated solution
for the professional healthcare community that integrates electronic health records, remote patient monitoring, telehealth, and other
items where integration is beneficial. 

Our
History 

The
Company has had three distinct businesses. First, we were incorporated in the state of Nevada on June 25, 2013 as Tomichi Creek Outfitters,
aiming to provide professionally guided big game hunts in Sargents, Colorado which is approximately four hours southwest from Denver.
This area of the country is home to trophy size Elk and Mule Deer. Our secondary business included offering guided scenic tours on the
western slopes of the Rocky Mountains. Every season offers a diversified plethora of wildlife and stunning scenic views. Our Chief Executive
Officer CEO and sole director at that time was Jeremy Gindro. These operations were discontinued in 2015. 

Second,
on March 2, 2015, the Company entered into a Business Acquisition Agreement and share exchange under which we acquired the business and
assets of Grasshopper Staffing, Inc. Grasshopper Colorado ), formed in the state of Colorado on January 13, 2015. The exchange
for 10,651 was represented by 250,000 shares of the Company s common stock in exchange for all the outstanding shares of Grasshopper
Colorado. The assets purchased include the trademark and website, office supplies and office furniture. On November 2, 2015 we filed
a Certificate of Amendment to our Articles of Incorporation changing the name of our Company from Tomichi Creek Outfitters to Grasshopper
Staffing, Inc. Grasshopper Colorado was operating as a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company and was the primary operation of our business
until the acquisition of IndeLiving Holdings Inc., on March 13, 2018. Our management consisted of Melanie Osterman as CEO, and Jeremy
Gindro who was our sole director. The operations of Grasshopper Colorado were discontinued in February 2019. 

Third,
we acquired IndeLiving Holdings, Inc. IndeLiving on March 13, 2018 and changed our name to Healthcare Integrated Technologies,
Inc. Our current operations are described above. With the acquisition of IndeLiving, we had another change in management, and Scott M.
Boruff became CEO and sole director of the Company. 

Employees
and Human Capital 

At
July 31, 2021, we had 4 employees. 

At
July 31, 2020, we had 3 employees. 

None
of our employees are represented by a union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We have not experienced any work stoppages
and we consider our relationship with our employees to be good. 

4 

Our
human capital resources objectives include, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing and integrating our existing
and new employees, advisors and consultants. The principal purposes of our equity incentive plan are to attract, retain and reward
personnel through the granting of stock-based compensation awards, in order to increase stockholder value and the success of our company
by motivating such individuals to perform to the best of their abilities and achieve our objectives. 

Available
Information 

We
electronically file certain documents with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC). We file annual reports on Form 10-K; quarterly
reports on Form 10-Q; and current reports on Form 8-K (as appropriate); along with any related amendments and supplements thereto. From
time-to-time, we may also file registration statements and related documents in connection with equity or debt offerings. You may read
and copy any materials we file with the SEC at the SEC s Public Reference Room at 100 F Street, NE, Washington, DC 20549. You may
obtain information regarding the Public Reference Room by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330. In addition, the SEC maintains an internet
website at www.sec.gov that contains reports and other information regarding registrants that file electronically with the SEC. 

ITEM
1A. RISK FACTORS. 

Risks
Related to Economic and Market Conditions 

General
Economic and Financial Conditions 

The
success of any investment activity is influenced by general economic and financial conditions, all of which are beyond the control of
the Company. These conditions, such as the recent global economic crisis and significant downturns in the financial markets, may materially
adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and ability to implement our business strategy and/or meet our return objectives. 

The
recent global outbreak of COVID-19 (more commonly known as the Coronavirus) has disrupted economic markets and the prolonged economic
impact is uncertain, which could adversely affect our business operations and materially and adversely affect our results of operations,
cash flows and financial position. Some economists and major investment banks have expressed concern that the continued spread of the
virus globally could lead to a world-wide economic downturn. Many manufacturers of goods in China and other countries have seen a downturn
in production due to the suspension of business and temporary closure of factories in an attempt to curb the spread of the illness. 

The
impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic may remain prevalent for a significant period of time and may continue to adversely affect our business,
results of operations and financial condition even after the COVID-19 outbreak has subsided. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic
impacts us will depend on numerous evolving factors and future developments that we are not able to predict. Due to the largely unprecedented
and evolving nature of the COVID-19 pandemic, it remains very difficult to predict the extent of the impact on our industry generally
and our business in particular. 

Risks
Related to Our Business 

The
Company s industry is highly competitive and we have less capital and resources than many of our competitors which may give them
an advantage in developing and marketing products similar to ours or make our products obsolete. 

We
are involved in a highly competitive industry where we may compete with numerous other companies who offer alternative methods or approaches,
who may have far greater resources, more experience, and personnel perhaps more qualified than we do. Such resources may give our competitors
an advantage in developing and marketing products similar to ours or products that make our products obsolete. There can be no assurance
that we will be able to successfully compete against these other entities. 

5 

The
Company may be unable to respond to the rapid technological change in its industry and such change may increase costs and competition
that may adversely affect its business 

Rapidly
changing technologies, frequent new product and service introductions and evolving industry standards characterize the Company s
market. The continued growth of the Internet and intense competition in the Company s industry exacerbate these market characteristics.
The Company s future success will depend on its ability to adapt to rapidly changing technologies by continually improving the
performance features and reliability of its products and services. The Company may experience difficulties that could delay or prevent
the successful development, introduction or marketing of its products and services. In addition, any new enhancements must meet the requirements
of its current and prospective users and must achieve significant market acceptance. The Company could also incur substantial costs if
it needs to modify its products and services or infrastructures to adapt to these changes. 

The
Company also expects that new competitors may introduce products, systems or services that are directly or indirectly competitive with
the Company. These competitors may succeed in developing, products, systems and services that have greater functionality or are less
costly than the Company s products, systems and services, and may be more successful in marketing such products, systems and services.
Technological changes have lowered the cost of operating communications and computer systems and purchasing software. These changes reduce
the Company s cost of providing services but also facilitate increased competition by reducing competitors costs in providing
similar services. This competition could increase price competition and reduce anticipated profit margins. 

The
Company s services are new and its industry is evolving. 

You
should consider the Company s prospects considering the risks, uncertainties and difficulties frequently encountered by companies
in their early stage of development. To be successful in this industry, the Company must, among other things: 

develop
 and introduce functional and attractive services; 

attract
 and maintain a large base of customers; 

increase
 awareness of the Company brand and develop consumer loyalty; 

respond
 to competitive and technological developments; 

build
 an operations structure to support the Company business; and 

attract,
 retain and motivate qualified personnel. 

The
Company cannot guarantee that it will succeed in achieving these goals, and its failure to do so would have a material adverse effect
on its business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. 

The
Company s products and services are new and are in the early stages of development. The Company is not certain that these products
and services will function as anticipated or be desirable to its intended market. Also, some of the Company s products and services
may have limited functionalities, which may limit their appeal to consumers and put the Company at a competitive disadvantage. If the
Company s current or future products and services fail to function properly or if the Company does not achieve or sustain market
acceptance, it could lose customers or could be subject to claims which could have a material adverse effect on the Company s business,
financial condition and operating results. 

6 

Risks
Related to Our Company 

Uncertainty
of profitability 

Our
business strategy may result in increased volatility of revenues and earnings. As we will only develop a limited number of products and
services at a time, our overall success will depend on a limited number of products and services, which may cause variability and unsteady
profits and losses depending on the products and services offered. 

Our
revenues and our profitability may be adversely affected by economic conditions and changes in the market. Our business is also subject
to general economic risks that could adversely impact the results of operations and financial condition. 

Because
of the anticipated nature of the products and services that we will attempt to develop, it is difficult to accurately forecast revenues
and operating results and these items could fluctuate in the future due to several factors. These factors may include, among other things,
the following: 

Our
 ability to raise sufficient capital to take advantage of opportunities and generate sufficient revenues to cover expenses. 

Our
 ability to source strong opportunities with sufficient risk adjusted returns. 

Our
 ability to manage our capital and liquidity requirements based on changing market conditions. 

The
 acceptance of the terms and conditions of our licenses and/or the acceptance of our royalties and fees. 

The
 amount and timing of operating costs and other costs and expenses. 

The
 nature and extent of competition from other companies that may reduce market share and create pressure on pricing and investment
 return expectations. 

Adverse
 changes in the national and regional economies in which we will participate, including, but not limited to, changes in our performance,
 capital availability, and market demand. 

Adverse
 changes in the projects in which we plan to invest which result from factors beyond our control, including, but not limited to, a
 change in circumstances, capacity and economic impacts. 

Changes
 in laws, regulations, accounting, taxation, and other requirements affecting our operations and business. 

Our
 operating results may fluctuate from year to year due to the factors listed above and others not listed. At times, these fluctuations
 may be significant. 

Our
independent auditors report for the fiscal years ended July 31, 2021 and 2020 have expressed doubts about our ability to continue
as a going concern 

Due
to the uncertainty of our ability to meet our current operating and capital expenses, in our audited annual financial statements as of
and for the years ended July 31, 2021 and 2020, our independent auditors included a note to our financial statements regarding concerns
about our ability to continue as a going concern. We have incurred recurring losses and have generated limited revenue since inception.
These factors and our need for additional financing to effectively execute our business plan, raise substantial doubt about our ability
to continue as a going concern. The presence of the going concern note to our financial statements may have an adverse impact on the
relationships we are developing and plan to develop with third parties as we continue the commercialization of our products and could
make it challenging and difficult for us to raise additional financing, all of which could have a material adverse impact on our business
and prospects and result in a significant or complete loss of your investment. 

7 

COVID-19
could adversely impact our business 

On
January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization WHO announced a global health emergency because of a new strain of coronavirus
originating in Wuhan, China (the COVID-19 outbreak and the risks to the international community as the virus spreads globally
beyond its point of origin. In March 2020, the WHO classified the COVID-19 outbreak as a pandemic, based on the rapid increase in exposure
globally. The full impact of the COVID-19 outbreak continues to evolve as of the date of this report. As such, it is uncertain as to
the full magnitude that the pandemic will have on the Company s future financial condition, liquidity, and results of operations.
Management is actively monitoring the impact of the global situation on its financial condition, liquidity, operations, suppliers, industry,
and workforce. Given the daily evolution of the COVID-19 outbreak and the global responses to curb its spread, the Company is not able
to estimate the effects of the COVID-19 outbreak on its results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity for fiscal year 2022. 

Management
of growth will be necessary for us to be competitive 

Successful
expansion of our business will depend on our ability to effectively attract and manage staff, strategic business relationships, and shareholders.
Specifically, we will need to hire skilled management and technical personnel as well as manage partnerships to navigate shifts in the
general economic environment. Expansion has the potential to place significant strains on financial, management, and operational resources,
yet failure to expand will inhibit our profitability goals. 

We
are entering a potentially highly competitive market 

The
markets for the healthcare and senior monitoring industries are competitive and evolving. We face strong competition from larger companies
that may be in the process of offering similar products and services to ours. Many of our current and potential competitors have longer
operating histories, significantly greater financial, marketing and other resources and larger client bases than we have or expect to
have. 

Given
the rapid changes affecting the global, national, and regional economies generally, and the healthcare industry specifically, we may
not be able to create and maintain a competitive advantage in the marketplace. Our success will depend on our ability to keep pace with
any market, legal and regulatory changes as well as competitive pressures. Any failure by us to anticipate or respond adequately to such
changes could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, operating results, liquidity and cash flow. 

If
we fail to establish and maintain an effective system of internal control, we may not be able to report our financial results accurately
or to prevent fraud. Any inability to report and file our financial results accurately and timely could harm our reputation and adversely
impact the future trading price of our common stock. 

Effective
internal control is necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and prevent fraud. If we cannot provide reliable financial
reports or prevent fraud, we may not be able to manage our business as effectively as we would if an effective control environment existed,
and our business and reputation with investors may be harmed. As a result, our small size and any current internal control deficiencies
may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operation and access to capital. 

We
currently have insufficient written policies and procedures for accounting and financial reporting with respect to the requirements and
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America U.S. GAAP and the United States Securities and
Exchange Commission (the SEC disclosure requirements. Additionally, there is a lack of formal process and timeline for
closing the books and records at the end of each reporting period and such weaknesses restrict the Company s ability to timely
gather, analyze and report information relative to the financial statements. 

Because
of the Company s limited resources, there are limited controls over information processing. There is inadequate segregation of
duties consistent with control objectives. Our Company s management is composed of a small number of individuals resulting in a
situation where limitations on segregation of duties exist. In order to remedy this situation, we would need to hire additional staff. 

8 

The
Company s failure to continue to attract, train, or retain highly qualified personnel could harm the company s business. 

The
Company s success also depends on the Company s ability to attract, train, and retain qualified personnel, specifically those
with management and product development skills. In particular, the Company must hire additional skilled personnel to further the Company s
research and development efforts. Competition for such personnel is intense. If the Company fails in attracting new personnel or retaining
and motivating the Company s current personnel, the Company s business could be harmed. 

Risks
Related to Our Common Stock 

Because
we will likely issue additional shares of our common stock, investment in our Company could be subject to substantial dilution. 

Investors 
interests in our company will be diluted and investors may suffer dilution in their net book value per share when we issue additional
shares. We are authorized to issue 200,000,000 shares of common stock, 0.001 par value per share. As of October 28, 2021, there
were 42,034,673 shares of our common stock issued and outstanding. We anticipate that all or at least some of our future funding,
if any, will be in the form of equity financing from the sale of our common stock. If we do sell more common stock, investors 
investment in our company will likely be diluted. Dilution is the difference between what you pay for your stock and the net tangible
book value per share immediately after the additional shares are sold by us. If dilution occurs, any investment in the Company s
common stock could seriously decline in value. 

Trading
in our common stock on the OTC Pink has been subject to wide fluctuations. 

Our
common stock is currently quoted for public trading on the OTC Pink. The trading price of our common stock has been subject to wide fluctuations.
Trading prices of our common stock may fluctuate in response to several factors, many of which will be beyond our control. The stock
market has generally experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating
performance of companies with no current business operation. There can be no assurance that trading prices and price earnings ratios
previously experienced by our common stock will be matched or maintained. These broad market and industry factors may adversely affect
the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market
price of a company s securities, securities class-action litigation has often been instituted. Such litigation, if instituted,
could result in substantial costs for us and a diversion of management s attention and resources. 

Our
Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws provides for indemnification of officers and directors at our expense and limit their liability
which may result in a major cost to us and hurt the interests of our shareholders because corporate resources may be expended for the
benefit of officers and/or directors. 

Our
Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws include provisions that fully eliminate the personal liability of our directors for monetary
damages to the fullest extent possible under the laws of the State of Nevada or other applicable law. These provisions eliminate the
liability of our directors and our shareholders for monetary damages arising out of any violation of a director of his fiduciary duty
of due care. Under Nevada law, however, such provisions do not eliminate the personal liability of a director for (i) breach of the director s
duty of loyalty, (ii) acts or omissions not in good faith or involving intentional misconduct or knowing violation of law, (iii) payment
of dividends or repurchases of stock other than from lawfully available funds, or (iv) any transaction from which the director derived
an improper benefit. These provisions do not affect a director s liabilities under the federal securities laws or the recovery
of damages by third parties. 

We
do not intend to pay dividends on any investment in the shares of stock of our Company and any gain on an investment in our Company will
need to come through an increase in our stock s price, which may never happen. 

We
have never paid any cash dividends and currently do not intend to pay any dividends for the foreseeable future. To the extent that we
require additional funding currently not provided for in our financing plan, our funding sources may prohibit the payment of a dividend.
Because we do not intend to declare dividends, any gain on an investment in our company will need to come through an increase in the
price of our common shares. This may never occur and investors may lose all their investment in our company.

Because
our securities are subject to penny stock rules, you may have difficulty reselling your shares. 

Our
shares, as penny stocks, are covered by Section 15(g) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 which imposes additional sales practice
requirements on broker/dealers who sell our company s securities including the delivery of a standardized disclosure document;
disclosure and confirmation of quotation prices; disclosure of compensation the broker/dealer receives; and furnishing monthly account
statements. These rules apply to companies whose shares are not traded on a national stock exchange, trade at less than 5.00 per share,
or who do not meet certain other financial requirements specified by the Securities and Exchange Commission. 

These
rules require brokers who sell penny stocks to persons other than established customers and accredited investors 
to complete certain documentation, make suitability inquiries of investors, and provide investors with certain information concerning
the risks of trading in such penny stocks. These rules may discourage or restrict the ability of brokers to sell our shares of common
stock and may affect the secondary market for our shares of common stock. These rules could also hamper our ability to raise funds in
the primary market for our shares of common stock. 

FINRA
sales practice requirements may also limit a stockholder s ability to buy and sell our stock. 

In
addition to the penny stock rules described above, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (known as FINRA has adopted rules that require that in recommending an investment to a customer, a broker-dealer must have reasonable grounds for believing
that the investment is suitable for that customer. Prior to recommending speculative low-priced securities to their non-institutional
customers, broker-dealers must make reasonable efforts to obtain information about the customer s financial status, tax status,
investment objectives and other information. Under interpretations of these rules, FINRA believes that there is a high probability that
speculative low-priced securities will not be suitable for at least some customers. FINRA requirements make it more difficult for broker-dealers
to recommend that their customers buy our common shares, which may limit your ability to buy and sell our stock and have an adverse effect
on the market for our shares. 

There
could be unidentified risks involved with an investment in our securities 

The
foregoing risk factors are not a complete list or explanation of the risks involved with an investment in the securities. Additional
risks will likely be experienced that are not presently foreseen by the Company. Prospective investors must not construe this information
provided herein as constituting investment, legal, tax or other professional advice. Before making any decision to invest in our securities,
you should read this entire prospectus and consult with your own investment, legal, tax and other professional advisors. An investment
in our securities is suitable only for investors who can assume the financial risks of an investment in the Company for an indefinite
period and who can afford to lose their entire investment. The Company makes no representations or warranties of any kind with respect
to the likelihood of the success or the business of the Company, the value of our securities, any financial returns that may be generated
or any tax benefits or consequences that may result from an investment in the Company.

This
discussion summarizes the significant factors affecting the consolidated financial statements, financial condition, liquidity, and cash
flows of Healthcare Integrated Technologies, Inc, for the fiscal years ended July 31, 2021 and 2020 and the interim periods included
herein. The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes included
elsewhere in this Form 10-K. 

Executive
Overview 

Healthcare
Integrated Technologies, Inc. and its subsidiaries is a healthcare technology company based in Knoxville, Tennessee. We are creating
a diversified spectrum of healthcare technology solutions to integrate and automate the continuing care, home care and professional healthcare
spaces. 

Our
initial product, SafeSpace with AI Vision , is an ambient fall detection solution designed for continuing care communities
and at home use. SafeSpace includes hardware devices utilizing RGB, radar and other sensor technology coupled with our internally developed
software to effectively monitor a person remotely. In continuing care communities, SafeSpace detects resident falls and generates alerts
to a centralized, intelligent dashboard without the use of wearable devices or any action by the resident. In the home, SafeSpace detects
falls and sends alerts directly to designated individuals. 

In
addition to SafeSpace, we are creating a home concierge healthcare service application to provide a virtual assisted living experience
for seniors, recently released postoperative patients and others. The concierge application will enable the consumer to obtain home healthcare
services and health and safety monitoring equipment to improve quality of life. We are also working to develop a fully integrated solution
for the professional healthcare community that integrates electronic health records, remote patient monitoring, telehealth, and other
items where integration is beneficial. 

Strategy 

Our
mission is to grow a profitable healthcare technology company by focusing on our core product, continuing the development of our proprietary
software, and developing new uses and product lines for our technology. Our management team is focused on maintaining the financial flexibility
and assembling the right complement of personnel and outside consultants required to successfully execute our mission.

Financial
and Operating Results 

We
continue to utilize funds raised from the private sales of our common stock, issuance of debt, and short-term advances from related parties
to provide cash for our operations, which allowed us to continue refining our initial product and readying it for pilot testing, developing
our future product offerings and adding talented individuals to our management team. Highlighted achievements for the fiscal year ended
July 31, 2021 include: 

On
 August 11, 2020 we agreed to repurchase 1,000,000 shares of our common stock from Acorn Management Partners, LLC AMP ).
 The purchased shares were delivered by AMP directly to the transfer agent on September 8, 2020 and immediately cancelled. 

On
 August 15, 2020, we issued 112,624 shares of common stock to the holder of a 50,000 5 Convertible Promissory Note (the Note in exchange for the Note plus accrued interest of 6,312 through the conversion date. Under the terms of the Note, the shares were
 issued at a conversion price of 0.50 per share. 

On
 September 1, 2020, Susan A. Reyes, M.D. was appointed Chief Medical Officer and entered into a three-year employment agreement with
 the Company. The employment agreement provides for a base salary of 52,000 per annum (on a part-time basis) and 1,000,000 options
 to purchase the Company s common stock at an exercise price of 0.40 per share, with 25 immediately vested and exercisable
 on the grant date and the remaining options vesting equally over a period of three (3) years from the grant date. The value of the
 options on the grant date was estimated using the Black-Scholes pricing model and is being recognized as an expense over the vesting
 term. 

On
 October 13, 2020, we completed two (2) private placement transactions totaling 1,050,000 shares of our common stock, each at a price
 of 0.10 per share, resulting in net proceeds to the Company of 105,000. We incurred no cost related to the private placements. 

On
 December 2, 2020, we completed a private placement transaction of 1,500,000 shares of our common stock at a price of 0.10 per share
 resulting in net proceeds to the Company of 150,000. We incurred no cost related to the private placement. 

On
 December 14, 2020, the U.S. Small Business Administration (the SBA forgave the entire principal balance of 41,667
 and related accrued interest charges of 264 then due under our Paycheck Protection Program loan we closed with Mountain Commerce
 Bank on April 30, 2020. 

On
 February 2, 2021, we entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement with AJB Capital Investments, LLC AJB Capital ),
 pursuant to which AJB Capital purchased a Promissory Note (the AJB Note in the principal amount of 360,000 for an
 aggregate purchase price of 320,400. The transaction resulted in 300,700 in net proceeds to the Company after payment of closing
 cost and a finder s fee of 6,408. In addition, we issued 1,333,334 shares of common stock to the purchaser of the note as
 an origination fee.

 issued at a conversion price of 0.50 per share. 

On
 February 23, 2021, we issued 231,250 shares of common stock to the holder of a 100,000 5 Convertible Promissory Note (the Note in exchange for the Note plus accrued interest of 15,625 through the conversion date. Under the terms of the Note, the shares were
 issued at a conversion price of 0.50 per share. 

On

 a series of payments, and with the initial payment of 50,000 due upon execution of the Subscription Agreement.

Officers 
Salaries - Officers salaries, net of capitalized amounts, increased 107,971 over 2020, or 26 . The increase is attributable
to the uncapitalized portion of our CTO s salary for the entire period, eleven months of salary for our new CMO, and our CFO s
salary at an increased rate for the entire period. In 2020, Officers salaries only included the salary of our CEO, and our CFO s
salary for approximately ten months. 

Stock-Based
Compensation - Stock-based compensation expense increased 214,163, or 53 , over the same period in the prior year. The increase
results from amortization of the grant date fair value of additional employee stock options granted to our CTO and new CMO, as well as
a restricted stock grant to our CFO. 

Professional
Fees - Professional fees decreased 12,971, or 12 , from 2020. Accounting fees decreased 38,725 in 2021 after the filing
of our July 31, 2019 Comprehensive Form 10-K that was filed in March 2020. The decrease in accounting fees was partially offset by an
increase in legal and consulting fees of 28,528. 

Advertising
and Marketing - Advertising and marketing expense decreased 61,651 from 2020, or 92 . In 2020 we engaged BrandMETTLE as our
advertising agency and incurred additional advertising expense from the issuance of common stock for services under our agreement. 

Depreciation
and Amortization - Depreciation and amortization expense increased 3,802 over the same period in the prior year. The increase
results from amortization expense related to new intangible assets placed in service in 2021 partially offset by declining depreciation
expense as older assets become fully depreciated and/or disposed of. 

14 

Other
 - Other expense increased 6,797, over 2020. The increase is primarily due to increased travel and entertainment expenses from capital
raising efforts.

Interest
Expense - Interest expense increased 186,336 over the same period in the prior year. The increase is primarily due
to the 180,000 amortization of debt discount and related interest payments of 17,806 on the AJB Capital Investments, LLC note (the
AJB Note issued during the current period. The increase was partially offset by a reduction in outstanding 5 convertible
notes for 2021 due to note conversions. 

Derivative
Expense - Derivative expense is 97,201 for the year ended July 31, 2021. The expense is attributable to the excess of the fair market
value of the derivative liability associated with our new AJB Note over the net book value of the note at issuance. We incurred no derivative
expense in the year ended July 31, 2020. 

Change
in Fair Value of Derivative Liability - The change in the fair value of the derivative liability associated with our new AJB
Note reflects a gain of 89,669 on the change in fair value at the date of issuance of the note to its fair value at July 31, 2021.
We incurred no change in derivative liabilities in the year ended July 31, 2020. 

Debt
Forgiveness - Income from debt forgiveness was 41,931 for the year ended July 31, 2021. The income results from the forgiveness
of our Small Business Administration Paycheck Protection Program loan, plus related accrued interest, on December 14, 2021. We had no
debt forgiveness income in the year ended July 31, 2020. 

Lawsuit
Settlement - Income from lawsuit settlements was 13,110 for the year ended July 31, 2021. The income results from the settlement
of a lawsuit with RBSM on May 27, 2021. We had no income from lawsuit settlements in the year ended July 31, 2020. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources

Capital

 capital deficiency 
 (2,210,414 
 (1,857,593 

Current
assets for the year ended July 31, 2021 decreased as compared to July 31, 2020 due to a decrease in cash and cash equivalents and prepaid
legal fees, primarily resulting from the payment of amounts owed to related parties and the amortization of prepaid legal fees in 2021. 

Current
liabilities for the year ended July 31, 2021 increased as compared to July 31, 2020. The increase is primarily due to our new Acorn Management
Partners, LLC and AJB Capital Investments, LLC short-term notes payable in 2021 and the continued accrual of officer s compensation,
with such increases being partially offset by a net decrease in related party accounts payable and accrued expenses, and a decrease in
our outstanding 5 convertible promissory notes and related accrued interest expense from the conversion of the notes into common stock. 

Net
Cash Used by Operating Activities 

We
currently do not have a revenue source and will continue to have negative cash flow from operations for the near future. The factors
in determining operating cash flows are largely the same as those that affect net earnings, except for non-cash expenses such as depreciation
and amortization, stock-based compensation, amortization of debt discount, derivative expense and changes in fair value of assets and
liabilities, which affect earnings but do not affect cash flow. Net cash used by operating activities was 592,192 for the year ended
July 31, 2021 as compared to 188,655 for the year ended July 31, 2020. The 403,537 increase in cash used during 2021 is primarily attributable
to an increase in cash payments of officer s compensation. 

Net
Cash Used by Investing Activities 

Net
cash used by investing activities was 60,608 for the year ended July 31, 2021. The amount is comprised of cash paid for the filing of
patent and trademark applications and for the development of software for our internal use. We had no cash flows from investing activities
during the year ended July 31, 2020. 

Net
Cash Provided by Financing Activities 

Net
cash provided by financing activities was 586,171 for the year ended July 31, 2021, which represents a 320,169 increase over the year
ended July 31, 2020. During 2021, we received 355,000 from the sale of common stock in four private transactions, which is a 60,000
increase over the cash received from common stock sales in 2020. In addition, we received 300,700 in net proceeds from the issuance
of promissory notes, which is a 259,033 increase in the cash received from the issuance of promissory notes in 2020. 

15 

At
this time, we cannot provide investors with any assurance that we will be able to obtain sufficient funding from debt financings and/or
the sale of our equity securities to meet our obligations over the next twelve months. We are likely to continue using short-term loans
from management to meet our short-term funding needs. We have no material commitments for capital expenditures as of July 31, 2021. 

Going
Concern Qualification 

We
have a history of losses, an accumulated deficit, a negative working capital and have not generated cash from operations to support a
meaningful and ongoing business plan. Our Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm has included a Going Concern Qualification 
in their report for the years ended July 31, 2021, 2020, 2019, 2018, 2017 and 2016. The foregoing raises substantial doubt about the
Company s ability to continue as a going concern. We intend on financing our future activities and working capital needs largely
from the sale of private and/or public equity securities with additional funding from other traditional financing sources, including
term notes, until such time that funds provided by operations are sufficient to fund working capital requirements. There is no guarantee
that additional capital or debt financing will be available when and to the extent required, or that if available, it will be on terms
acceptable to us. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.
The Going Concern Qualification might make it substantially more difficult to raise capital. 

Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates 

Our
consolidated financial statements and related public financial information are based on the application of U.S. GAAP. U.S. GAAP requires
the use of estimates; assumptions, judgments and subjective interpretations of accounting principles that have an impact on the assets,
liabilities, revenues and expense amounts reported. These estimates can also affect supplemental information contained in our external
disclosures including information regarding contingencies, risk and financial condition. We believe our use of estimates and underlying
accounting assumptions adhere to U.S. GAAP and are consistently and conservatively applied. We base our estimates on historical experience
and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ materially from
these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We continue to monitor significant estimates made during the preparation of
our financial statements. 

Our
significant accounting policies are summarized in Note 1 of our consolidated financial statements. 

We
believe the following critical policies impact our more significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of our financial statements. 

Use
of Estimates 

The
preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated
financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from
those estimates. We base our estimates on experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on a regular basis and actual results may differ from those estimates. 

Impairment
of Long-Lived Assets 

Long-lived
assets such as property, equipment and identifiable intangibles are reviewed for impairment whenever facts and circumstances indicate
that the carrying value may not be recoverable. When required impairment losses on assets to be held and used are recognized based on
the fair value of the asset. The fair value is determined based on estimates of future cash flows, market value of similar assets, if
available, or independent appraisals, if required. If the carrying amount of the long-lived asset is not recoverable from its undiscounted
cash flows, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between the carrying amount and fair value of the asset. When fair values
are not available, we estimate fair value using the expected future cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk associated
with the recovery of the assets. We did not recognize any impairment losses for any periods presented. 

16 

Intangible
Assets 

Intangible
assets consist of patents, our website and the costs of software developed for internal use. Certain payroll and stock-based compensation
costs incurred are allocated to the intangible assets. We determine the amount of costs to be capitalized based on the time spent by
employees or outside contractors on the projects. Intangible assets are amortized over their expected useful life on a straight-line
basis. We evaluate the useful lives of these assets on an annual basis and test for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances
occur that could impact the recoverability of these assets. If the estimate of an intangible asset s remaining life is changed,
the remaining carrying value of the intangible asset is amortized prospectively over the revised remaining useful life. We did not recognize
any impairment losses during any of the periods presented. 

Fair
Value of Financial Instruments 

Fair
value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset, or paid to transfer a liability, in an orderly transaction between
market participants. A fair value hierarchy has been established for valuation inputs that gives the highest priority to quoted prices
in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. The fair value hierarchy is as
follows: 

Level
1 Inputs - Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting entity can access at the
measurement date. 

Level
2 Inputs - Inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.
These might include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets
or liabilities in markets that are not active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability (such as
interest rates, volatilities, prepayment speeds, credit risks, etc.) or inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by market
data by correlation or other means. 

Level
3 Inputs - Unobservable inputs for determining the fair values of assets or liabilities that reflect an entity s own assumptions
about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the assets or liabilities. 

Financial
instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and borrowings. The fair value of current financial
assets and current financial liabilities approximates their carrying value because of the short-term maturity of these financial instruments. 

Derivative
Liability 

Options,
warrants, convertible notes, or other contracts, if any, are evaluated to determine if those contracts, or embedded components of those
contracts, qualify as derivatives to be separately accounted for in accordance with paragraph 815-10-05-4 and Section 815-40-25 of the
Financial Accounting Standards Board (the FASB Accounting Standards Codification ASC ). The result of this
accounting treatment is that the fair value of the embedded derivative is marked-to-market each balance sheet date and recorded as either
an asset or a liability. The change in fair value is recorded in the consolidated statement of operations as other income or expense.
Upon conversion, exercise or cancellation of a derivative instrument, the instrument is marked to fair value at the date of conversion,
exercise, or cancellation and then the related fair value is reclassified to equity. 

In
circumstances where the embedded conversion option in a convertible instrument is required to be bifurcated, and there are also other
embedded derivative instruments in the convertible instrument that are required to be bifurcated, the bifurcated derivative instruments
are accounted for as a single, compound derivative instrument. 

The
classification of derivative instruments, including whether such instruments should be recorded as liabilities or as equity, is re-assessed
at the end of each reporting period. Equity instruments that are initially classified as equity that become subject to reclassification
are reclassified to liability at the fair value of the instrument on the reclassification date. Derivative instrument liabilities will
be classified in the balance sheet as current or non-current based on whether or not net-cash settlement of the derivative instrument
is expected within 12 months of the balance sheet date. 

17 

The
Company adopted Section 815-40-15 of the FASB ASC Section 815-40-15 to determine whether an instrument (or an
embedded feature) is indexed to the Company s own stock. Section 815-40-15 provides that an entity should use a two- step approach
to evaluate whether an equity-linked financial instrument (or embedded feature) is indexed to its own stock, including evaluating the
instrument s contingent exercise and settlement provisions. 

We
utilize a binomial option pricing model to compute the fair value of the derivative liability and to mark to market the fair value of
the derivative at each balance sheet date. We record the change in the fair value of the derivative as other income or expense in the
consolidated statements of operations. 

Revenue
Recognition 

Revenue
is recognized under ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers using the modified retrospective method. Under
this method, the Company follows the five-step model provided by ASC Topic 606 in order to recognize revenue in the following manner:
1) Identify the contract; 2) Identify the performance obligations of the contract; 3) Determine the transaction price of the contract;
4) Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations; and 5) Recognize revenue. An entity recognizes revenue for the transfer
of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration for which the entity expects to be entitled in
exchange for those goods or services. The Company s revenue recognition policies remained substantially unchanged as a result of
the adoption of ASC 606, and there were no significant changes in business processes or systems. 

Stock-Based
Compensation 

The
Company accounts for stock-based compensation in accordance with ASC Topic 718, Compensation Stock Compensation 
 ASC 718 which establishes financial accounting and reporting standards for stock-based employee compensation. It
defines a fair value-based method of accounting for an employee stock option or similar equity instrument. The Company accounts for compensation
cost for stock option plans, if any, in accordance with ASC 718. 

Share-based
payments, excluding restricted stock, are valued using a Black-Scholes option pricing model. Grants of share-based payment awards issued
to non-employees for services rendered have been recorded at the fair value of the share-based payment, which is the more readily determinable
value. The grants are amortized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service periods, which is generally the vesting period. If
an award is granted, but vesting does not occur, any previously recognized compensation cost is reversed in the period related to the
termination of service. Stock-based compensation expenses are included in cost of goods sold or selling, general and administrative expenses,
depending on the nature of the services provided, in the consolidated statements of operations. Share-based payments issued to placement
agents are classified as a direct cost of a stock offering and are recorded as a reduction in additional paid in capital. 

The
Company recognizes all forms of share-based payments, including stock option grants, warrants and restricted stock grants, at their fair
value on the grant date, which are based on the estimated number of awards that are ultimately expected to vest. 

Business
Combinations 

We
account for business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting. The acquisition method requires that the acquired assets
and liabilities, including contingencies, be recorded at fair value determined on the acquisition date and that changes thereafter be
reflected in income (loss). The estimation of fair values of the assets and liabilities assumed involves several estimates and assumptions
that could differ materially from the actual amounts recorded. The results of the acquired businesses are included in our results from
operations beginning from the day of acquisition. 

Capital
Resources 

We
had no material commitments for capital expenditures as of July 31, 2021. 

18 

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements 

We
had no off-balance sheet arrangements as of July 31, 2021 or 2020. 

ITEM
7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. 

We
do not hold any market risk sensitive instruments. We consider our interest rate risk exposure to be minimal as a result of fixing interest
rates on 100 of our debt. At July 31, 2021, there was no floating rate debt that would expose us to market fluctuations in interest
rates.

ITEM
9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. 

Disclosure
Controls and Procedures 

Under
the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer,
we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in
Rules 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, at the end of the period covered by this report (the Evaluation
Date ). In conducting its evaluation, management considered the material weaknesses described below in Management s Report
on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. 

Based
on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that as of the Evaluation Date we did not
maintain disclosure controls and procedures that were effective in providing reasonable assurances that information required to be disclosed
in our reports filed under the Securities Exchange act of 1934 was recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
prescribed by SEC rules and regulations, and that such information was accumulated and communicated to our management to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Our
management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures
will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute,
assurance that the control system s objectives will be met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that
there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations
in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any,
have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns
can occur because of simple error or mistake. The design of any system of controls is based in part upon certain assumptions about the
likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential
future conditions. 

Management s
Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f)
under the Exchange Act). Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of July 31, 2021.
Based on such evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of July 31, 2021 our internal controls
over financial reporting were not effective. 

19 

In
making this assessment, our management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
in Internal Control-Integrated Framework. Our management has concluded that, as of July 31, 2021, our internal control over financial
reporting is not effective based on these criteria. Material weaknesses noted by our management include: 

Lack
 of a functioning audit committee; 

Lack
 of a majority of outside directors on our board of directors, resulting in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring
 of required internal controls and procedures; 

Inadequate
 segregation of duties consistent with control objectives and affecting the functions of authorization, recordkeeping, custody of
 assets, and reconciliation; 

Management
 dominated by a single individual/small group without adequate compensating controls. 

This
annual report does not include an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial
reporting. Management s report was not subject to attestation by our registered public accounting firm pursuant to temporary rules
of the SEC that permit us to provide only management s report in this annual report. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act,
during our most recently completed fiscal year that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal
control over financial reporting.

Family
Relationships 

There
are no family relationships among any of our directors or executive officers. 

Involvement
in Certain Legal Proceedings 

To
the best of the Company s knowledge, none of the Company s directors or executive officers has, during the past ten years,
except as set forth below: 

been
 convicted in a criminal proceeding or been subject to a pending criminal proceeding (excluding traffic violations and other minor
 offenses); 

had
 any bankruptcy petition filed by or against the business or property of the person, or of any partnership, corporation or business
 association of which he was a general partner or executive officer, either at the time of the bankruptcy filing or within two years
 prior to that time; 

been
 the subject of any order, judgment, or decree, not subsequently reversed, suspended or vacated, of any court of competent jurisdiction
 or federal or state authority, permanently or temporarily enjoining, barring, suspending or otherwise limiting, his involvement in
 any type of business, securities, futures, commodities, investment, banking, savings and loan, or insurance activities, or to be
 associated with persons engaged in any such activity; 

been
 found by a court of competent jurisdiction in a civil action or by the SEC or the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to have violated
 a federal or state securities or commodities law, and the judgment in such civil action has not been reversed, suspended, or vacated; 

22 

been
 the subject of, or a party to, any federal or state judicial or administrative order, judgment, decree, or finding, not subsequently
 reversed, suspended or vacated, relating to (i) an alleged violation of any federal or state securities or commodities law or regulation,
 (ii) any law or regulation respecting financial institutions or insurance companies including, but not limited to, a temporary or
 permanent injunction, order of disgorgement or restitution, civil money penalty or temporary or permanent cease-and-desist order,
 or removal or prohibition order, or (iii) any law or regulation prohibiting mail or wire fraud or fraud in connection with any business
 entity; or 

been
 the subject of, or a party to, any sanction or order, not subsequently reversed, suspended or vacated, of any self-regulatory organization
 (as defined in Section 3(a)(26) of the Exchange Act), any registered entity (as defined in Section 1(a)(29) of the Commodity Exchange
 Act), or any equivalent exchange, association, entity or organization that has disciplinary authority over its members or persons
 associated with a member. 

Mr.
Boruff served as a member of the Board of Directors, as Chief Executive Officer, and as Executive Chairman of Miller Energy Resources,
Inc. during the two years preceding Miller Energy Resources, Inc. s filing of a bankruptcy petition in August 2015. 

Mr.
Lobetti served as Treasurer of Miller Energy Resources, Inc. during the two-year period preceding Miller Energy Resources, Inc. s
filing of a bankruptcy petition in August 2015. 

Except
as set forth in the Company s discussion below in Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence ,
none of the Company s directors or executive officers has been involved in any transactions with the Company or any of the Company s
directors, executive officers, affiliates, or associates which are required to be disclosed pursuant to the rules and regulations of
the Commission. 

Compliance
with Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act 

Section
16(a) of the Exchange Act requires the Company s directors, executive officers and persons who beneficially own 10 or more of
a class of securities registered under Section 12 of the Exchange Act to file reports of beneficial ownership and changes in beneficial
ownership with the SEC. Directors, executive officers and greater than 10 stockholders are required by the rules and regulations of
the SEC to furnish the Company with copies of all reports filed by them in compliance with Section 16(a). 

Based
solely on our review of certain reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Section 16(a) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the reports required to be filed with respect to transactions in our common stock during the fiscal
year ended July 31, 2021 and 2020, were not timely. 

Term
of Office 

The
Company s directors are elected by the Company s stockholders for a one-year term until the next annual general meeting of
the Company s stockholders, or until removed by the stockholders in accordance with the Company s bylaws. The Company s
officers are appointed by the Board and hold office until removed by the Board. 

Code
of Ethics 

The
Company does not currently have a code of ethics, and because the Company has only limited business operations and only two officers
and one director, the Company believes that a code of ethics would have limited utility. The Company intends to adopt such a code of
ethics as the Company s business operations expand and the Company has more employees. 

Board
Committees 

As
we only have one board member and given our limited operations, we do not have separate or independent audit or compensation committees.
Our Board of Directors has determined that it does not have an audit committee financial expert, as that term is defined
in Item 407(d)(5) of Regulation S-K. In addition, we have not adopted any procedures by which our shareholders may recommend nominees
to our Board of Directors. 

23 

ITEM
11. EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION. 

The
following table summarizes all compensation recorded by us in the past two years for: 

our
 principal executive officer or other individual serving in a similar capacity, 

our
 three most highly compensated executive officers, other than our principal executive officer, who were serving as executive officers
 at July 31, 2021 and 2020 as that term is defined under Rule B-7 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

Executive
Compensation Agreements 

Scott
M. Boruff, CEO 

Effective
May 1, 2021, we entered into a Non-Employee Chief Executive Officer Engagement Agreement (the Contract CEO Agreement with
Platinum Equity Advisors, LLC Platinum to provide the services of Scott M. Boruff as Chief Executive Officer and Chairman
of the Board of Directors of the Company for a term of three (3) years. As compensation for the services, the Company shall pay Platinum
an annual base fee of 323,400 and it is entitled to discretionary bonus fee payments as may be awarded by our Board of Directors. During
the term of the Contract CEO Agreement, Mr. Boruff is entitled to participate in any employee benefit plans, programs or arrangements
of the Company in effect during the engagement period which are generally available to other senior executives of the Company. 

The
Contract CEO Agreement terminates upon the death or disability of Mr. Boruff, and may be terminated by us for cause, or by Platinum without
cause or for good reason. If the Contract CEO Agreement is terminated by us for cause, upon the death or disability of Mr. Boruff, at
non-renewal or by Platinum without good cause, Platinum is only entitled to receive compensation through the date of termination. If
the Contract CEO Agreement is terminated by us without cause or by Platinum for good reason, we are obligated to pay Platinum severance
equal to one year s base fee and any other earned but unpaid compensation. In addition, if at any time during the term of the Contract
CEO Agreement Platinum is terminated by us without cause within two years after a Change in Control of our company, or in the 90 days
prior the Change in Control at the request of the acquiror, we are obligated to pay Platinum an amount equal to 2.99 times the annual
base fee. Change in Control is defined in the Contract CEO Agreement to mean the acquisition by any person of beneficial
ownership of our securities representing greater than 50 of the combined voting power of our then outstanding voting securities. The
Contract CEO Agreement contains customary invention assignment, non-compete and non-solicitation provisions. 

Prior
to the May 1, 2021 effective date of the Contract CEO Agreement, Scott M. Boruff served as CEO of Company pursuant to an Employment Agreement
dated March 13, 2018, which was terminated on May 1, 2021. As compensation, we paid him an annual salary of 300,000 and he was entitled
to discretionary bonuses as may be awarded from time to time by our Board of Directors. As additional compensation, we granted him an
option to purchase 2,500,000 shares of the Company s common stock at an exercise price of 3.00 per share, which exceeded the fair
market price of our common stock on the date of grant, vesting in four equal annual installments commencing on the grant date. The vesting
date of any unvested options accelerates in the event of a Change in Control (as defined in the Employment Agreement). Mr. Boruff was
also entitled to paid vacation and sick leave, an automobile allowance and participation in any employee benefit plans or programs we
offered at the time. 

Charles
B. Lobetti, III, CFO 

Charles
B. Lobetti, III and the Company entered into a three-year Employment Agreement dated October 8, 2019, in which Mr. Lobetti agreed to
serve as our Chief Financial Officer. As compensation, we agreed to pay him an annual salary of 52,000 and he is entitled to discretionary
bonuses as may be awarded from time to time by our Board of Directors. Effective May 1, 2020, Mr. Lobetti s base salary was increased
to 104,000 to reflect an increased time commitment. As additional compensation we granted him stock options to purchase 600,000 shares
of our common stock at an exercise price of 0.15 per share, which was the closing price of common stock as reported on the OTC Markets
on the date immediately preceding the date of the Employment Agreement. The options vested 25 immediately upon execution of the Employment
Agreement with the remaining vesting equally in annual installments over three (3) years. The vesting date of any unvested options accelerates
in the event of a Change in Control (as defined in the Employment Agreement). Mr. Lobetti is also entitled to paid vacation and sick
leave, an automobile allowance and participation in any employee benefit plans or programs we may offer. The initial term of the Employment
Agreement will automatically renew for an additional one-year term unless either party provides notice of non-renewal. 

The
Employment Agreement terminates upon the death or disability of Mr. Lobetti, and may be terminated by us for cause, or by Mr. Lobetti
for any reason. If the Employment Agreement is terminated by us for cause, upon his death or disability, at non-renewal or by Mr. Lobetti,
he is only entitled to receive base salary accrued but not paid through the date of termination, and in the case of termination due to
death or disability, a pro rata payment of the annual incentive earned for the year of termination. If the Employment Agreement is terminated
by us without cause or by Mr. Lobetti for good reason, we are obligated to pay him severance equal to one year s base salary and
any unpaid incentive compensation. In addition, if at any time during the term of the Employment Agreement Mr. Lobetti s employment
is terminated by us without cause within two years after a Change in Control of our company, or in the 90 days prior the Change in Control
at the request of the acquiror, we are obligated to pay him an amount equal to 2.99 times his annualized compensation. Change
in Control is defined in the Employment Agreement to mean the acquisition by any person of beneficial ownership of our securities
representing greater than 50 of the combined voting power of our then outstanding voting securities. The Employment Agreement contains
customary invention assignment, non-compete and non-solicitation provisions.

Kenneth
M. Greenwood, CTO

bonuses as may be awarded from time to time by our Board of Directors. As additional compensation we granted him stock options to purchase
2,000,000 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of 0.30 per share, which was the closing price of common stock as reported

Agreement will automatically renew for an additional one-year term unless either party provides notice of non-renewal.

for any reason. If the Employment Agreement is terminated by us for cause, upon his death or disability, at non-renewal or by Mr. Greenwood,
he is only entitled to receive base salary accrued but not paid through the date of termination, and in the case of termination due to
death or disability, a pro rata payment of the annual incentive earned for the year of termination. If the Employment Agreement is terminated
by us without cause or by Mr. Greenwood for good reason, we are obligated to pay him severance equal to one year s base salary
and any unpaid incentive compensation. In addition, if at any time during the term of the Employment Agreement Mr. Greenwood s
employment is terminated by us without cause within two years after a Change in Control of our company, or in the 90 days prior the Change
in Control at the request of the acquiror, we are obligated to pay him an amount equal to 2.99 times his annualized compensation. Change
in Control is defined in the Employment Agreement to mean the acquisition by any person of beneficial ownership of our securities
representing greater than 50 of the combined voting power of our then outstanding voting securities. The Employment Agreement contains
customary invention assignment, non-compete and non-solicitation provisions. 

Susan
A. Reyes, M.D., CMO 

Susan
A. Reyes, M.D. and the Company entered into a three-year Employment Agreement dated September 1, 2020, in which Dr. Reyes agreed to serve
as our Chief Medical Officer. As compensation, we agreed to pay her an annual salary of 52,000 and she is entitled to discretionary
bonuses as may be awarded from time to time by our Board of Directors. As additional compensation we granted her stock options to purchase
1,000,000 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of 0.40 per share, which was the closing price of common stock as reported
on the OTC Markets on the date immediately preceding the date of the Employment Agreement. The options vested 150,000 shares immediately
upon execution of the Employment Agreement with the remaining vesting equally in annual installments over three (3) years. The vesting
date of any unvested options accelerates in the event of a Change in Control (as defined in the Employment Agreement). Dr. Reyes is also
entitled to paid vacation and sick leave, and participation in any employee benefit plans or programs we may offer. The initial term
of the Employment Agreement will automatically renew for an additional one-year term unless either party provides notice of non-renewal. 

The
Employment Agreement terminates upon the death or disability of Dr. Reyes, and may be terminated by us for cause, or by Dr. Reyes for
any reason. If the Employment Agreement is terminated by us for cause, upon her death or disability, at non-renewal or by Dr. Reyes,
she is only entitled to receive base salary accrued but not paid through the date of termination, and in the case of termination due
to death or disability, a pro rata payment of the annual incentive earned for the year of termination. If the Employment Agreement is
terminated by us without cause or by Dr. Reyes for good reason, we are obligated to pay her severance equal to one year s base
salary and any unpaid incentive compensation. In addition, if at any time during the term of the Employment Agreement Dr. Reyes 
employment is terminated by us without cause within two years after a Change in Control of our company, or in the 90 days prior the Change
in Control at the request of the acquiror, we are obligated to pay her an amount equal to 2.99 times her annualized compensation. Change
in Control is defined in the Employment Agreement to mean the acquisition by any person of beneficial ownership of our securities
representing greater than 50 of the combined voting power of our then outstanding voting securities. The Employment Agreement contains
customary invention assignment, non-compete and non-solicitation provisions.

 As
 used in this table, beneficial ownership means the sole or shared power to vote, or to direct the voting of, a security,
 or the sole or share investment power with respect to a security (i.e., the power to dispose of, or to direct the disposition of
 a security). The inclusion of any shares as deemed beneficially owned does not constitute an admission of beneficial ownership by
 the named stockholder. 

7) 
 Unless
 otherwise indicated, we have been advised that all individuals or entities listed have the sole power to vote and dispose of the
 number of shares set forth opposite their names. For purposes of computing the number and percentage of shares beneficially owned
 by a security holder, any shares which such person has the right to acquire within 60 days of October 28, 2021 are deemed
 to be outstanding, but those shares are not deemed to be outstanding for the purpose of computing the percentage ownership of any
 other security holder. We currently do not maintain any equity compensation plans. As of October 28, 2021, there were 45,793,006
 shares beneficially owned. 

Changes
in Control 

We
are not aware of any arrangements that may result in changes in control as that term is defined by the provisions of Item
403(c) of Regulation S-K. 

ITEM
13. CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS, AND DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE. 

Other
than compensation arrangements, the following is a description of transactions to which we were a participant or will be a participant
to, in which: 

the
 amounts involved exceeded or will exceed the lesser of 1 of our total assets or 120,000; and 

any
 of our directors, executive officers or holders of more than 5 of our capital stock, or any member of the immediate family of the
 foregoing persons, had or will have a direct or indirect material interest. 

To
continue operations and meet operating cash requirements, we have periodically relied on advances from related parties, primarily shareholders,
until such time as our cash flow from operations meets our cash requirements or we are able to obtain adequate financing through sales
of our equity securities and/or traditional debt financing. There is no formal written commitment for continued support by shareholders.
Amounts advanced primarily relate to amounts paid to vendors. The advances are considered temporary in nature and have not been formalized
by any written agreement. As of July 31, 2021 and 2020, related parties were owed 202,290 and 271,819, respectively. The amounts owed
are payable on demand and carry no interest. The amounts and terms of the related party advances may not necessarily be indicative of
the amounts and terms that would have been incurred had comparable transactions been entered into with independent third parties. 

Effective
May 1, 2021, we entered into a Non-Employee Chief Executive Officer Engagement Agreement (the Contract CEO Agreement with
Platinum Equity Advisors, LLC, a related party, to provide the services of our CEO and Chairman of the Board of Directors. Under the
terms of the Contract CEO Agreement, Platinum Equity Advisors, LLC is owed 50,150 at July 31, 2021.

Director
Independence 

We
currently have no independent directors. Because our common stock is not currently listed on a national securities exchange, we have
used the definition of independence of The NASDAQ Stock Market to make this determination. NASDAQ Listing Rule 5605(a)(2)
provides that an independent director is a person other than an officer or employee of the company or any other individual
having a relationship that, in the opinion of the company s board of directors, would interfere with the exercise of independent
judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director. The NASDAQ listing rules provide that a director cannot be considered independent
if: 

the
 director is, or at any time during the past three years was, an employee of the Company; 

the
 director or a family member of the director accepted any compensation from the Company in excess of 120,000 during any period of
 12 consecutive months within the three years preceding the independence determination (subject to certain exclusions, including,
 among other things, compensation for board or board committee service); 

a
 family member of the director is, or at any time during the past three years was, an executive officer of the Company; 

the
 director or a family member of the director is a partner in, controlling stockholder of, or an executive officer of an entity to
 which the Company made, or from which the Company received, payments in the current or any of the past three fiscal years that exceed
 5 of the recipient s consolidated gross revenue for that year or 200,000, whichever is greater (subject to certain exclusions); 

the
 director or a family member of the director is employed as an executive officer of an entity where, at any time during the past three
 years, any of the executive officers of the Company served on the compensation committee of such other entity; or 

The
 director or a family member of the director is a current partner of the Company s outside auditor, or at any time during the
 past three years was a partner or employee of the Company s outside auditor, and who worked on the Company s audit. 

The
Company does not currently have a separately designated audit, nominating, or compensation committee. 

ITEM
14. PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING FEES AND SERVICES. 

The
following table sets forth the aggregate fees billed for each of the last two fiscal years for professional services rendered by the
principal accountant for the audit of the Company s annual financial statements and review of financial statements included in
the Company s quarterly reports or services that are normally provided by the accountant in connection with statutory and regulatory

Report
of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 

To the Board
of Directors and Stockholders of 

 Healthcare Integrated
Technologies, Inc. 

Opinion
on the Consolidated Financial Statements 

We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Healthcare Integrated Technologies, Inc. (the Company as
of July 31, 2021 and 2020, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders deficit and cash flows for
each of the years in the two-year period ended July 31, 2021 and the related notes (collectively the financial statements).
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position
of the Company as of July 31, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its consolidated operations and its consolidated cash flows for each
of the years in the two-year period ended July 31, 2021, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America. 

Basis
for Opinion 

These
consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion
on the Company s consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance
with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud.
The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part
of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing
an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our
audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether
due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence
regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

Substantial
Doubt about the Company s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern 

The
accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed
in Note 2 to the financial statements, the Company has a history of losses, an accumulated deficit, has negative working capital and
has not generated cash from operations to support a meaningful and ongoing business plan. Management s evaluation of the events
and conditions and management s plans regarding those matters also are described in Note 2. The financial statements do not include
any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. Our opinion is not modified with respect to that matter.

INTEGRATED TECHNOLOGIES, INC. 

 NOTES
TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

 July
31, 2021 

NOTE
1 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 

Healthcare
Integrated Technologies, Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively the Company, we, our or us is a healthcare technology company based in Knoxville, Tennessee. We are creating a diversified spectrum of healthcare technology solutions
to integrate and automate the continuing care, home care and professional healthcare spaces. 

Our
initial product, SafeSpace with AI Vision , is an ambient fall detection solution designed for continuing care communities
and at home use. SafeSpace includes hardware devices utilizing RGB, radar and other sensor technology coupled with our internally developed
software to effectively monitor a person remotely. In continuing care communities, SafeSpace detects resident falls and generates alerts
to a centralized, intelligent dashboard without the use of wearable devices or any action by the resident. In the home, SafeSpace detects
falls and sends alerts directly to designated individuals. 

In
addition to SafeSpace, we are creating a home concierge healthcare service application to provide a virtual assisted living experience
for seniors, recently released postoperative patients and others. The concierge application will enable the consumer to obtain home healthcare
services and health and safety monitoring equipment to improve quality of life. We are also working to develop a fully integrated solution
for the professional healthcare community that integrates electronic health records, remote patient monitoring, telehealth, and other
items where integration is beneficial. 

Basis
of Presentation 

The
accompanying consolidated financial statements include those of Healthcare Integrated Technologies, Inc. and its subsidiaries, after
elimination of all intercompany accounts and transactions. We have prepared the accompanying consolidated financial statements in accordance
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America U.S. GAAP and pursuant to the rules and
regulations of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC ). 

Reclassifications 

Certain
prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to current period presentation. On the consolidated statements of operations for
the year ended July 31, 2020, we reclassified 1,521 in loss from discontinued operations to selling, general and administrative
expense and interest expense. The reclassification had no impact on previously reported net income. 

Risk
and Uncertainties 

Factors
that could affect our future operating results and cause actual results to vary materially from management s expectation include,
but are not limited to: our ability to maintain and secure adequate capital to fully develop our product(s) and operations; our ability
to source strong opportunities with sufficient risk adjusted returns; acceptance of the terms and conditions of our licenses and/or the
acceptance of our royalties and fees; the nature and extent of competition from other companies that may reduce market share and create
pressure on pricing and investment return expectations; changes in the projects in which we plan to invest which result from factors
beyond our control, including, but not limited to, a change in circumstances, capacity and economic impacts; changes in laws, regulations,
accounting, taxation, and other requirements affecting our operations and business. Negative developments in these or other risk factors
could have a significant adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 

F- 6 

On
January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization WHO announced a global health emergency because of a new strain of coronavirus
originating in Wuhan, China (the COVID-19 outbreak and the risks to the international community as the virus spreads globally
beyond its point of origin. In March 2020, the WHO classified the COVID-19 outbreak as a pandemic, based on the rapid increase in exposure
globally. The full impact of the COVID-19 outbreak continues to evolve as of the date of this report. As such, it is uncertain as to
the full magnitude that the pandemic will have on the Company s future financial condition, liquidity, and results of operations.
Management is actively monitoring the impact of the global situation on its financial condition, liquidity, operations, suppliers, industry,
and workforce. Given the daily evolution of the COVID-19 outbreak and the global responses to curb its spread, the Company is not able
to estimate the effects of the COVID-19 outbreak on its results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity for fiscal year 2022. 

Use
of Estimates 

The
preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated
financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results may differ
from those estimates. We base our estimates on experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the
circumstances. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on a regular basis and actual results may differ from those estimates. 

Concentration
of Credit Risk 

Financial
instruments that potentially expose the Company to credit risk consist of demand deposits with a financial institution. The Company is
exposed to credit risk on its cash and cash equivalents in the event of default by the financial institution to the extent account balances
exceed the amount insured by the FDIC, which is 250,000. 

Cash
and Cash Equivalents 

We
consider all highly liquid short-term investments with a maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents.
The Company minimizes its credit risk associated with cash by periodically evaluating the credit quality of its primary financial institution.
The balance at times may exceed federally insured limits. No loss has been experienced and management does not believe we are exposed
to any significant credit risk. 

Accounts
Receivable 

Accounts
receivable are stated at their historical carrying amount net of write-offs and allowance for uncollectible accounts. We routinely assess
the recoverability of all customer and other receivables to determine their collectability and record a reserve when, based on the judgement
of management, it is probably that a receivable will not be collected and the amount of the reserve may be reasonably estimated. When
collection is no longer pursued, we charge uncollectable accounts receivable against the reserve. 

Property
and Equipment 

Property
and equipment are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation. Expenditures for major additions and improvements are capitalized
while minor replacements and maintenance and repairs, which do not improve or extend the life of such assets, are charged to operations
as incurred. Disposals are removed at cost less accumulated depreciation, and any resulting gain or loss is reflected in the consolidated
statement of operations. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method which depreciates the assets over the estimated useful
lives of the depreciable assets ranging from five to seven years. 

Impairment
of Long-Lived Assets 

Long-lived
assets such as property, equipment and identifiable intangibles are reviewed for impairment at least annually or whenever facts and circumstances
indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. When required, impairment losses on assets to be held and used are recognized
based on the fair value of the asset. The fair value is determined based on estimates of future cash flows, market value of similar assets,
if available, or independent appraisals, if required. If the carrying amount of the long-lived asset is not recoverable, an impairment
loss is recognized for the difference between the carrying amount and fair value of the asset. The Company did not recognize any impairment
losses for any periods presented. 

F- 7 

Intangible
Assets 

Intangible
assets consist of patents, our website and the costs of software developed for internal use. Certain payroll and stock-based compensation
costs incurred are allocated to the intangible assets. We determine the amount of costs to be capitalized based on the time spent by
employees or outside contractors on the projects. Intangible assets are amortized over their expected useful life on a straight-line
basis. We evaluate the useful lives of these assets on an annual basis and test for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances
occur that could impact the recoverability of these assets. If the estimate of an intangible asset s remaining life is changed,
the remaining carrying value of the intangible asset is amortized prospectively over the revised remaining useful life. We did not recognize
any impairment losses during any of the periods presented. 

Fair
Value of Financial Instruments 

Fair
value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset, or paid to transfer a liability, in an orderly transaction between
market participants. A fair value hierarchy has been established for valuation inputs that gives the highest priority to quoted prices
in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. The fair value hierarchy is as
follows: 

Level
1 Inputs - Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting entity can access at the
measurement date. 

Level
2 Inputs - Inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.
These might include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets
or liabilities in markets that are not active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability (such as
interest rates, volatilities, prepayment speeds, credit risks, etc.) or inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by market
data by correlation or other means. 

Level
3 Inputs - Unobservable inputs for determining the fair values of assets or liabilities that reflect an entity s own assumptions
about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the assets or liabilities. 

Financial
instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and borrowings. The fair value of current financial
assets and current financial liabilities approximates their carrying value because of the short-term maturity of these financial instruments. 

Derivative
Liability 

Options,
warrants, convertible notes, or other contracts, if any, are evaluated to determine if those contracts, or embedded components of those
contracts, qualify as derivatives to be separately accounted for in accordance with paragraph 815-10-05-4 and Section 815-40-25 of the
Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB Accounting Standards Codification ASC ). The result of this accounting
treatment is that the fair value of the embedded derivative is marked-to-market each balance sheet date and recorded as either an asset
or a liability. The change in fair value is recorded in the consolidated statement of operations as other income or expense. Upon conversion,
exercise or cancellation of a derivative instrument, the instrument is marked to fair value at the date of conversion, exercise, or cancellation
and then the related fair value is reclassified to equity. 

In
circumstances where the embedded conversion option in a convertible instrument is required to be bifurcated, and there are also other
embedded derivative instruments in the convertible instrument that are required to be bifurcated, the bifurcated derivative instruments
are accounted for as a single, compound derivative instrument. 

The
classification of derivative instruments, including whether such instruments should be recorded as liabilities or as equity, is re-assessed
at the end of each reporting period. Equity instruments that are initially classified as equity that become subject to reclassification
are reclassified to liability at the fair value of the instrument on the reclassification date. Derivative instrument liabilities will
be classified in the balance sheet as current or non-current based on whether net-cash settlement of the derivative instrument
is expected within 12 months of the balance sheet date. 

F- 8 

The
Company adopted Section 815-40-15 of the FASB ASC Section 815-40-15 to determine whether an instrument (or an
embedded feature) is indexed to the Company s own stock. Section 815-40-15 provides that an entity should use a two- step approach
to evaluate whether an equity-linked financial instrument (or embedded feature) is indexed to its own stock, including evaluating the
instrument s contingent exercise and settlement provisions. 

We
utilize a binomial option pricing model to compute the fair value of the derivative liability and to mark to market the fair value of
the derivative at each balance sheet date. We record the change in the fair value of the derivative as other income or expense in the
consolidated statements of operations. 

The
Company had a derivative liability of 108,232 as July 31, 2021. We had no derivative liability at July 31, 2020. 

Revenue
Recognition 

Revenue
is recognized under ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers using the modified retrospective method. Under
this method, the Company follows the five-step model provided by ASC Topic 606 in order to recognize revenue in the following manner:
1) Identify the contract; 2) Identify the performance obligations of the contract; 3) Determine the transaction price of the contract;
4) Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations; and 5) Recognize revenue. An entity recognizes revenue for the transfer
of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration for which the entity expects to be entitled in
exchange for those goods or services. The Company s revenue recognition policies remained substantially unchanged as a result of
the adoption of ASC 606, and there were no significant changes in business processes or systems. 

Advertising 

Advertising
costs are expensed as incurred in accordance with ASC 720-35, Advertising Costs . We incurred advertising costs of
 5,297 and 50,927 for the years ended July 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, which are included in selling, general and administrative
expenses on the consolidated financial statements. 

Net
Loss Per Common Share 

We
determine basic income (loss) per share and diluted income (loss) per share in accordance with the provisions of ASC 260, Earnings
Per Share . Basic loss per share excludes dilution and is computed by dividing earnings available to common stockholders by
the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period. The calculation of diluted income (loss) per share is similar
to that of basic earnings per share, except the denominator is increased, if the earnings are positive, to include the number of additional
common shares that would have been outstanding if all potentially dilutive common shares had been exercised. 

Stock-Based
Compensation 

The
Company accounts for stock-based compensation in accordance with ASC Topic 718, Compensation Stock Compensation 
 ASC 718 which establishes financial accounting and reporting standards for stock-based employee compensation. It
defines a fair value-based method of accounting for an employee stock option or similar equity instrument. The Company accounts for compensation
cost for stock option plans, if any, in accordance with ASC 718. 

Share-based
payments, excluding restricted stock, are valued using a Black-Scholes option pricing model. Grants of share-based payment awards issued
to non-employees for services rendered have been recorded at the fair value of the share-based payment, which is the more readily determinable
value. The grants are amortized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service periods, which is generally the vesting period. If
an award is granted, but vesting does not occur, any previously recognized compensation cost is reversed in the period related to the
termination of service. Stock-based compensation expenses are included in cost of goods sold or selling, general and administrative expenses,
depending on the nature of the services provided, in the consolidated statements of operations. Share-based payments issued to placement
agents are classified as a direct cost of a stock offering and are recorded as a reduction in additional paid in capital. 

F- 9 

The
Company recognizes all forms of share-based payments, including stock option grants, warrants and restricted stock grants, at their fair
value on the grant date, which are based on the estimated number of awards that are ultimately expected to vest. See Note 13. 

Business
Combinations 

We
account for business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting. The acquisition method requires that the acquired assets
and liabilities, including contingencies, be recorded at fair value determined on the acquisition date and that changes thereafter be
reflected in income (loss). The estimation of fair values of the assets and liabilities assumed involves several estimates and assumptions
that could differ materially from the actual amounts recorded. The results of the acquired businesses are included in our results from
operations beginning from the day of acquisition. 

Income
Taxes 

We
use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes in accordance with Topic 740, Income Taxes . Under
this method, income tax expense is recognized for the amount of: (1) taxes payable or refundable for the current year and (2) deferred
tax consequences of temporary differences resulting from matters that have been recognized in an entity s financial statements
or tax returns. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years
in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a
change in tax rates is recognized in the results of operations in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance
is provided to reduce the deferred tax assets reported if based on the weight of the available positive and negative evidence, it is
more likely than not some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. 

ASC
Topic 740-10-30 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements and
prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position
taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. ASC Topic 740-10-40 provides guidance on de-recognition, classification, interest and
penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and transition. We have no material uncertain tax positions for any of the reporting
periods presented. 

In
response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act CARES Act was signed
into law in March 2020. The CARES Act lifts certain deduction limitations originally imposed by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 2017
Tax Act ). Corporate taxpayers may carryback net operating losses (NOLs) originating between 2018 and 2020 for up to five years,
which was not previously allowed under the 2017 Tax Act. The CARES Act also eliminates the 80 of taxable income limitations by allowing
corporate entities to fully utilize NOL carryforwards to offset taxable income in 2018, 2019 or 2020. Taxpayers may generally deduct
interest up to the sum of 50 of adjusted taxable income plus business interest income (30 limit under the 2017 Tax Act) for 2019 and
2020. The CARES Act allows taxpayers with alternative minimum tax credits to claim a refund in 2020 for the entire amount of the credits
instead of recovering the credits through refunds over a period of years, as originally enacted by the 2017 Tax Act. 

In
addition, the CARES Act raises the corporate charitable deduction limit to 25 of taxable income and makes qualified improvement property
generally eligible for 15-year cost-recovery and 100 bonus depreciation. The enactment of the CARES Act did not result in any material
adjustments to our income tax provision for the reporting periods presented. 

Recently
Adopted Accounting Pronouncements 

In
August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-13, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosure Framework Changes to the Disclosure
Requirements for Fair Value Measurement . This update is to improve the effectiveness of disclosures in the notes to the financial
statements by facilitating clear communication of the information required by U.S. GAAP that is most important to users of each entity s
financial statements. The amendments in this update apply to all entities that are required, under existing U.S. GAAP, to make disclosures
about recurring or nonrecurring fair value measurements. The amendments in this update are effective for all entities for fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 2019, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company adopted this guidance and the adoption
of this update did not have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements. 

F- 10 

In
March 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate
Reform on Financial Reporting . ASU 2020-04 provides optional expedients and exceptions to account for contracts, hedging relationships
and other transactions that reference LIBOR or another reference rate if certain criteria are met. The amendments of ASU No. 2020-04
are effective immediately, as of March 12, 2020, and may be applied prospectively to contract modifications made and hedging relationships
entered into on or before December 31, 2022. The Company adopted this guidance and the adoption of this update did not have a material
impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements. 

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements 

In
December 2019, the FASB issued authoritative guidance intended to simplify the accounting for income taxes (ASU 2019-12, Income
Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes ). This guidance eliminates certain exceptions to the
general approach to the income tax accounting model and adds new guidance to reduce the complexity in accounting for income taxes.
This guidance is effective for annual periods after December 15, 2020, including interim periods within those annual periods. The Company
is currently evaluating the potential impact of this guidance on its consolidated financial statements. 

In
August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06 Debt - Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and
Hedging - Contracts in Entity s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an
Entity s Own Equity . The amendments in Update No. 2020-06 simplify the complexity associated with applying U.S. GAAP for certain
financial instruments with characteristics of liabilities and equity. More specifically, the amendments focus on the guidance for convertible
instruments and derivative scope exception for contracts in an entity s own equity. Update No. 2020-06 is effective for fiscal
years beginning after December 15, 2021, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted, but no earlier
than fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is currently in
the process of determining the effect that the adoption will have on its financial position and results of operations. 

Management
has evaluated all recent accounting pronouncements as issued by the FASB in the form of Accounting Standards Updates ASU through the date these consolidated financial statements were available to be issued and found no recent accounting pronouncements issued,
but not yet effective, that when adopted, will have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements of the Company. 

NOTE
2 - GOING CONCERN 

The
accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP, which contemplates continuation of the
Company as a going concern. The Company had a net loss of 1,455,025 for its most recent fiscal year ended July 31, 2021. As of July
31, 2021, the Company has minimal cash and a significant working capital deficit. We have a history of losses, an accumulated deficit,
have negative working capital and have not generated cash from our operations to support a meaningful and ongoing business plan. It is
management s opinion that these conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. 

In
view of these matters, our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the development, marketing and sales of a viable
product to achieve a level of profitability. We intend to finance our future development activities and our working capital needs largely
from the sale of private and public equity securities with additional funding from other traditional financing sources, including term
notes, until such time that funds provided by operations are sufficient to fund working capital requirements. Although the Company believes
in the viability of management s strategy to generate sufficient revenue, control costs and the ability to raise additional capital,
there can be no assurances to that effect. Therefore, the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming
that the Company will continue as a going concern. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the
recoverability and classification of recorded assets, or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that might be necessary should
we be unable to continue as a going concern.

Convertible Promissory Notes 

On
various dates during the month of March 2018, we issued a series of 5 Convertible Promissory Notes (collectively, the 5 Notes totaling 750,000 in net proceeds. We incurred no costs related to the issuance of the 5 Notes. The 5 Notes bear interest at the rate
of five percent (5 per annum, compounded annually and matured one-year from the date of issuance. At July 31, 2021 and 2020, accrued
but unpaid interest on the 5 Notes was 61,202 and 73,903, respectively, which is included in accounts payable and accrued expenses 
on our consolidated balance sheets. 

The
5 Notes are convertible into common shares of the Company at a fixed ratio of two shares of common stock per dollar amount of the face
value of the note. The principal terms under which the 5 Notes may be converted into common stock of the Company are as follows: 

At
 the option of the holder, the outstanding principal amount of the note, and any accrued but unpaid interest due, may be converted
 into the Company s common stock at any time prior to the maturity date of the note. 

The
 outstanding principal amount of the note, and any accrued but unpaid interest due, will automatically be converted into the Company s
 common stock if at any time prior to the maturity date of the note, the Company concludes a sale of equity securities in a private
 offering resulting in gross proceeds to the Company of at least 1,000,000. 

5 
Notes with a face amount of 275,000 and accrued interest expense of 42,531 were converted, at the option of the holder, into 635,062
shares of our common stock during the year ended July 31, 2021. On July 31, 2021, 5 Notes with a face amount of 325,000 and related
accrued interest expense of 61,202 are currently in default and are not convertible under the conversion terms. Management is currently
negotiating amendments to the notes in default to extend the maturity dates of such notes and to encourage note conversions. 

Note
Payable to Acorn Management Partners, LLC 

On
August 11, 2020 we agreed to repurchase 1,000,000 shares of our common stock from Acorn Management Partners, LLC AMP ).
As consideration for the share repurchase, we issued a 50,000 promissory note bearing interest a 6.0 per annum and due one-year from
the date of issuance (the Note ). In the event we default under the terms of the Note, we are required to deliver 1,000,000
shares of our common stock back to AMP in full satisfaction of the obligation. The purchased shares were delivered by AMP directly to
the transfer agent on September 8, 2020 and immediately cancelled. At July 31, 2021, accrued but unpaid interest on the Note was 2,919,
which is included in accounts payable and accrued expenses on our consolidated balance sheets. There was no accrued interest
due on the Note at July 31, 2020.

Note
Payable to AJB Capital Investments, LLC 

On
February 2, 2021, we entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement with AJB Capital Investments, LLC AJB Capital ), pursuant
to which AJB Capital purchased a Promissory Note (the AJB Note in the principal amount of 360,000 for an aggregate purchase
price of 320,400. The AJB Note accrues interest at the rate of ten percent (10 per annum and matures on August 2, 2021. At our option,
the maturity date of the note may be extended for six (6) months. If we extend the maturity date, the AJB Note interest rate increases
to twelve percent (12 per annum during the extension period. The Company is required to make monthly interest payments and the principal
balance is due in a single lump sum payment on the maturity date. We recorded a debt discount of 59,300 related to original issue discount
and issuance cost of the note. 

In
the event of default, the AJB Note may be converted into shares of the Company s common stock at a conversion price equal to the
lesser of 90 (representing a 10 discount) multiplied by the lowest trading price (i) during the previous twenty (20) trading day period
ending on the issuance date of the note, or (ii) during the previous twenty (20) trading day period ending on the date of conversion
of the note. We recorded a debt discount of 100,700 related to the conversion feature of the AJB Note. 

As
additional consideration for the purchase of the AJB Note, we issued AJB Capital 1,333,334 shares of our common stock as an origination
fee. The 200,000 grant date fair value of the shares was recorded as a debt discount. 

Total
unamortized debt discount related to the AJB Note at July 31, 2021 was 180,000. There was no unamortized debt discount at July 31, 2020.
During the year ended July 31, 2021, we amortized 180,000 of debt discount which is included as a component of interest expense in the
consolidated statements of operations. There was no amortization of debt discount for the year ended July 31, 2020. 

Paycheck
Protection Program Loan 

On
March 27, 2020 the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the CARES Act was enacted and included a provision
for the Small Business Administration SBA to implement its Paycheck Protection Program PPP ). The PPP provides
small businesses with funds to pay up to eight (8) weeks of payroll costs, including benefits. Funds received under the PPP may also
be used to pay interest on mortgages, rent, and utilities. Subject to certain criteria being met, all or a portion of the loan may be
forgiven. The loans bear interest at an annual rate of one percent (1 ), are due two (2) years from the date of issuance, and all payments
are deferred for the first six (6) months of the loan. Any unforgiven balance of loan principal and accrued interest at the end of the
six (6) month loan deferral period is amortized in equal monthly instalments over the remaining 18-months of the loan term. On April
30, 2020, we closed a 41,667 SBA guaranteed PPP loan with Mountain Commerce Bank. We used the loan proceeds as permitted and applied
for forgiveness of the entire loan amount and related accrued interest. On December 14, 2020, the outstanding principal balance of the
note and related accrued interest of 264 were forgiven by the SBA, which is recorded as Debt forgiveness of 41,931 on
the consolidated statements of operations. 

NOTE
8 - DERIVATIVE LIABILITY 

On
February 2, 2021, we entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement with AJB Capital Investments, LLC AJB Capital ), pursuant

price of 320,400 (See Note 7). In the event of default, the AJB Note may be converted into shares of the Company s common stock.
We identified certain conversion features embedded in the AJB Note that represent a derivative liability.

Upon
valuation of the derivative features of the AJB Note, we determined the total amount of debt discounts exceeded the face amount of the
note and recorded derivative expense for the excess amount. Derivative expense for the year ended July 31, 2021 was 97,201. There was
no derivative expense for the year ended July 31, 2020.

In
assessing the realizable value of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all
the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon generation of future
taxable income during the periods in which these temporary differences become tax deductible. Based on management s assessment
of objective and subjective evidence, we have concluded at this time it is more likely than not that all of our deferred tax asset will
not be realized and we have provided a valuation allowance for the entire amount of the deferred tax asset. At July 31, 2021, we have
approximately 3.16 million in federal and state net operating loss carryovers that begin expiring in fiscal 2037. 

F- 15 

We
conduct business solely in the United States and file income tax returns in the United States federal jurisdiction as well as in the
states of Tennessee and Colorado. The taxable years ended July 31, 2021, 2020, 2019 and 2018 remain open to examination by the taxing
jurisdictions to which we are subject. 

The
Company evaluated the provisions of ASC 740 related to the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s
financial statements. ASC 740 prescribes a comprehensive model for how a company should recognize, present, and disclose uncertain positions
that the Company has taken or expects to take in its tax return. For those benefits to be recognized, a tax position must be more-likely-than-not
to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities. Differences between tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return
and the net benefit recognized and measured pursuant to the interpretation are referred to as unrecognized benefits. A
liability is recognized (or amount of net operating loss carry forward or amount of tax refundable is reduced) for unrecognized tax benefit
because it represents an enterprise s potential future obligation to the taxing authority for a tax position that was not recognized
as a result of applying the provisions of ASC 740. 

If
applicable, interest costs related to the unrecognized tax benefits are required to be calculated and would be classified as Other
expenses Interest expense in the consolidated statements of operations. Penalties would be recognized as a component of
 General and administrative. 

No
material interest or penalties on unpaid tax were recorded during the years ended July 31, 2021 and 2020. As of July 31, 2021 and 2020,
no liability for unrecognized tax benefits was required to be reported. The Company does not expect any significant changes in its unrecognized
tax benefits in the next year. 

NOTE
10 - RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS 

To
continue operations and meet operating cash requirements, we have periodically relied on advances from related parties, primarily shareholders,
until such time as our cash flow from operations meets our cash requirements or we are able to obtain adequate financing through sales

Summary
of Stock Options and Warrants 

During
the year ended July 31, 2021, we recorded 621,776 of compensation expense, net of capitalized expense of 78,631, related to stock options
and warrants. During the year ended July 31, 2020, we recorded 407,613 of compensation expense, net of capitalized expense of 20,641,
related to stock options and warrants. The grant date fair value of stock options and warrants issued during the years ended July 31,
2021 and 2020 was 241,433 and 808,253, respectively. 

We
estimated the grant date fair value of stock options and warrants using the Black-Scholes pricing model with the following weighted average

Expected
Volatility 

Due
to the fact we do not consider historical volatility is the best indicator of future volatility, we use implied volatility of our options
to estimate future volatility. 

Expected
Term 

Where
possible, we use the simplified method to estimate the expected term of employee stock options. Where we are unable to use the simplified
method due to the terms of a stock option, we may use a modified simplified method to estimate the expected term. We do not have adequate
historical exercise data to provide a reasonable basis for estimating the expected term for the current share options granted. The simplified
method assumes that employees will exercise share options evenly between the period when the share options are vested and ending on the
date when the options would expire. 

Risk-Free
Interest Rate 

The
risk-free rate for the expected term of the option is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve at the date of grant. 

Dividend
Yield 

We
have not estimated any dividend yield as we currently do not pay a dividend and do not anticipate paying a dividend over the expected
term.
