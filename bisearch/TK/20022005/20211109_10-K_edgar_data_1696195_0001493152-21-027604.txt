FORWARD
LOOKING STATEMENTS 

This
Annual Report contains forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are projections of events, revenues, income, future economic
performance or management s plans and objectives for our future operations. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements
by terminology such as may , should , expects , plans , anticipates ,
 believes , estimates , predicts , potential or continue or the negative
of these terms or other comparable terminology. These statements are only predictions and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties
and other factors, including the risks in the section entitled Risk Factors and the risks set out below, any of which may
cause our or our industry s actual results, levels of activity, performance or achievements to be materially different from any
future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. These risks
include, by way of example and not in limitation: 

the
 uncertainty of profitability based upon our history of losses; 

risks
 related to failure to obtain adequate financing on a timely basis and on acceptable terms to continue as going concern; 

risks
 related to our international operations and currency exchange fluctuations; and 

other
 risks and uncertainties related to our business plan and business strategy. 

This
list is not an exhaustive list of the factors that may affect any of our forward-looking statements. These and other factors should be
considered carefully and readers should not place undue reliance on our forward-looking statements. Forward looking statements are made
based on management s beliefs, estimates and opinions on the date the statements are made and we undertake no obligation to update
forward-looking statements if these beliefs, estimates and opinions or other circumstances should change. Although we believe that the
expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, levels of activity, performance
or achievements. Except as required by applicable law, including the securities laws of the United States, we do not intend to update
any of the forward-looking statements to conform these statements to actual results. 

Our
financial statements are stated in United States dollars (US and are prepared in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting
Principles. All references to common stock refer to the common shares in our capital stock.

used in this annual report, the terms we , us , our , the Company and Kinetic
Group mean Kinetic Group Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiary Kinetic Development Inc, unless otherwise indicated.

 BUSINESS 

Our
Business 

Kinetic
Group Inc., a Nevada corporation, was formed under the laws of the State of Nevada on June 6, 2014. Kinetic Group is a full service integrated
digital marketing agency. The company provides marketing and strategy services to early stage companies. 

Kinetic
Group Inc. is a development stage company as defined by section 915-10-20 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification. Although the
Company has recognized nominal amounts of revenue, it is still devoting substantially all of its efforts on establishing its business.
All losses accumulated since Inception (June 6, 2014) have been considered as part of the Company s development stage activities. 

In
June 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-10, Development Stage Entities (Topic 915): Elimination of Certain Financial Reporting Requirements,
Including an Amendment to Variable Interest Entities Guidance in Topic 810, Consolidation. 

1 

The
amendments in this Update remove the definition of a development stage entity from the Master Glossary of the Accounting Standards Codification,
thereby removing the financial reporting distinction between development stage entities and other reporting entities from U.S. GAAP.
In addition, the amendments eliminate the requirements for development stage entities to (1) present inception-to-date information in
the statements of income, cash flows, and shareholder equity, (2) label the financial statements as those of a development stage entity,
(3) disclose a description of the development stage activities in which the entity is engaged, and (4) disclose in the first year in
which the entity is no longer a development stage entity that in prior years it had been in the development stage. 

For
public business entities, those amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2014, and interim
periods therein. Kinetic Group has elected to early adopt Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-10, Development Stage Entities (Topic
915): Elimination of Certain Financial Reporting Requirements. The adoption of this ASU allows the company to remove the inception to
date information and all references to development stage. 

Patent,
Trademark, License and Franchise Restrictions and Contractual Obligations and Concessions 

We
do not own, either legally or beneficially, any patents or trademarks. 

Research
and Development Activities 

Other
than time spent researching our proposed business we have not spent any funds on research and development activities to date. We do not
currently plan to spend any funds on research and development activities in the future. 

Compliance
with Environmental Laws 

We
are not aware of any environmental laws that have been enacted, nor are we aware of any such laws being contemplated for the future,
that impact issues specific to our business. 

Employees 

As
of September 30, 2021 we had one employee and director Aitan Zacharin, our chief executive officer and sole director. Our officers
and directors are responsible for planning, developing and operational duties, and will continue to do so throughout the early stages
of our growth. 

Reports
to Securities Holders 

We
provide an annual report that includes audited financial information to our shareholders. We will make our financial information equally
available to any interested parties or investors through compliance with the disclosure rules for a small business issuer under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934. We are voluntarily subject to disclosure filing requirements including filing Form 10K annually and Form 10Q quarterly.
In addition, we will file Form 8K and other proxy and information statements from time to time as required. The public may read and copy
any materials that we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, SEC ), at the SEC s Public Reference Room
at 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 20549. 

The
public may obtain information on the operation of the Public Reference Room by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330. The SEC maintains an
Internet site (http://www.sec.gov) that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers that
file electronically with the SEC.

date information and all references to Development Stage. 

Kinetic
Group Inc. is an emerging growth company under the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act. We cannot be certain if the reduced
reporting requirements applicable to emerging growth companies will make our shares of common stock less attractive to investors. 

Kinetic
Group Inc. is and will remain an emerging growth company until the earliest to occur of (a) the last day of the fiscal
year during which its total annual revenues equal or exceed 1 billion (subject to adjustment for inflation), (b) the last day of the
fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of its initial public offering, (c) the date on which Kinetic Group has, during the previous
three-year period, issued more than 1 billion in non-convertible debt securities, or (d) the date on which Kinetic Group is deemed a
 large accelerated filer (with at least 700 million in public float) under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934. 

For
so long as Kinetic Group remains an emerging growth company as defined in the JOBS Act, it may take advantage of certain
exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies 
as described in further detail in the risk factors below. Kinetic Group cannot predict if investors will consider its shares of common
stock less attractive because our reliance on some or all of these exemptions. If some investors find Kinetic Group s shares of
common stock less attractive as a result, the trading market for its shares of common stock may be less active, and its stock price may
be more volatile. 

If
Kinetic Group avails itself of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements, its reduced disclosure may make it more difficult
for investors and securities analysts to evaluate Kinetic Group and may result in less investor confidence. 

The
recently enacted JOBS Act is intended to reduce the regulatory burden on emerging growth companies . Kinetic Group meets
the definition of an emerging growth company and so long as it qualifies as an emerging growth company, it
will not be required to: 

have
 an auditor report on our internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act; 

comply
 with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation
 or a supplement to the auditor s report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements (i.e.,
 an auditor discussion and analysis); 

submit
 certain executive compensation matters to shareholder advisory votes, such as say-on-pay and say-on-frequency; 
 and 

disclose
 certain executive compensation related items such as the correlation between executive compensation and performance and comparisons
 of the CEO s compensation to median employee compensation. 

3 

In
addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended
transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other
words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise
apply to private companies. However, Kinetic Group is choosing to opt out of such extended transition period, and as a result, Kinetic
Group will comply with new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for
non-emerging growth companies. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that its decision to opt out of the extended transition period for
complying with new or revised accounting standards is irrevocable. 

Notwithstanding
the above, we are also currently a smaller reporting company , meaning that we are not an investment company, an asset-backed
issuer, or a majority-owned subsidiary of a parent company that is not a smaller reporting company and have a public float of less than
 75 million and annual revenues of less than 50 million during the most recently completed fiscal year. In the event that we are still
considered a smaller reporting company , at such time are we cease being an emerging growth company , we will
be required to provide additional disclosure in our SEC filings. However, similar to emerging growth companies , smaller
reporting companies are able to provide simplified executive compensation disclosures in their filings; are exempt from the provisions
of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requiring that independent registered public accounting firms provide an attestation report
on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting; are not required to conduct say-on-pay and frequency votes until annual
meetings occurring on or after January 21, 2013; and have certain other decreased disclosure obligations in their SEC filings, including,
among other things, only being required to provide two years of audited financial statements in annual reports. 

Decreased
disclosures in our SEC filings due to our status as an emerging growth company or smaller reporting company 
may make it harder for investors to analyze the Company s results of operations and financial prospects. 

We
lack an operating history. There is no assurance our future operations will result in profitable revenues. If we cannot generate sufficient
revenues to operate profitably, our business will fail. 

As
of September 30, 2021, we had accumulated a deficit of 197,922. We have a limited operating history upon which an evaluation of our
future success or failure can be made. Based on current plans, we expect to continue generating revenues. However, our revenues may not
be sufficient to cover our operating costs. We cannot guarantee that we will be successful in generating significant revenues in the
future. Failure to achieve a sustainable sales level will cause us to go out of business. 

If
we encounter unforeseen difficulties with our business or operations in the future that require us to obtain additional working capital,
and we cannot obtain additional working capital on favorable terms, or at all, our business may suffer . 

To
date, we have relied primarily upon cash from the private sale of equity securities and our operational activities. 

We
may encounter unforeseen difficulties with our business or operations in the future that may deplete our capital resources more rapidly
than anticipated. As a result, we may be required to obtain additional working capital in the future through bank credit facilities,
public or private debt or equity financings, or otherwise. We have not identified other sources for additional funding and cannot be
certain that additional funding will be available on acceptable terms, or at all. If we are required to raise additional working capital
in the future, such financing may be unavailable to us on favorable terms, if at all, or may be dilutive to our existing stockholders.
If we fail to obtain additional working capital as and when needed, such failure could have a material adverse impact on our business,
results of operations and financial condition. Furthermore, such lack of funds may inhibit our ability to respond to competitive pressures
or unanticipated capital needs, or may force us to reduce operating expenses, which could significantly harm the business and development
of operations. Because our independent auditors have expressed doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern, 
as reported in their report on our financial statements, our ability to raise capital may be severely hampered. Similarly, our ability
to borrow any such capital may be more expensive and difficult to obtain until this going concern uncertainty is resolved. 

4 

We
face intense competition in our industry. If we are unable to compete successfully, our business will be seriously harmed. 

The
market for online marketing services is highly competitive and has low barriers to entry. Our competitors vary in size and in the variety
of services they offer. Many of our current and potential competitors are well established and have longer operating histories, significantly
greater financial and operational resources, and greater name and brand recognition than we have. As a result, these competitors may
have greater credibility with both existing and potential customers. These competitors may be able to adapt more quickly to new or emerging
online marketing technologies and changes in customer requirements. They also may be able to offer more products and more aggressively
promote and sell their products. Our competitors may also be able to support more aggressive pricing than we will be able to, which could
adversely affect sales, cause us to decrease our prices to remain competitive, or otherwise reduce the overall gross profit earned on
our products. 

We
depend on key personnel. 

We
are currently relying on key individuals to continue our business and operations and, in particular, the professional expertise and services
of Aitan Zacharin, our Chief Executive Officer and Director. 

U.S.
investors may experience difficulties in attempting to effect a service of process and enforce judgments based upon U.S. Federal Securities
Laws against the company and its non U.S. resident officers and directors. 

We
are a Nevada corporation and, as such, are subject to the jurisdiction of the State of Nevada and the United States courts for purposes
of any lawsuit, action or proceeding by investors herein. An investor would have the ability to effect service of process in any action
on the company within the United States. 

However,
since Mr. Zacharin, our sole officer and director, resides outside the United States, substantially all or a portion of their assets
are located outside the United States. As a result, it may not be possible for investors to: 

effect
 service of process within the United States against your non-U.S. resident officers or directors; 

enforce
 U.S. court judgments based upon the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal securities laws against any of the above referenced
 foreign persons in the United States; 

enforce
 in foreign courts U.S. court judgments based on the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal securities laws against the above
 foreign persons; and 

bring
 an original action in foreign courts to enforce liabilities based upon the U.S. federal securities laws against the above foreign
 persons. 

We
do not have a majority of independent directors on our Board and the Company has not voluntarily implemented various corporate governance
measures, in the absence of which stockholders may have more limited protections against interested director transactions, conflicts
of interest and similar matters. 

Federal
legislation, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, has resulted in the adoption of various corporate governance measures designed
to promote the integrity of the corporate management and the securities markets. Some of these measures have been adopted in response
to legal requirements. Others have been adopted by companies in response to the requirements of national securities exchanges, such as
the NYSE or the NASDAQ Stock Market, on which their securities are listed. Among the corporate governance measures that are required
under the rules of national securities exchanges are those that address the board of directors independence, audit committee oversight,
and the adoption of a code of ethics. We have not yet adopted any of these other corporate governance measures and since our securities
are not yet listed on a national securities exchange, we are not required to do so. 

5 

Our
Board of Directors is comprised of one individual, who is also our executive officer. As a result, we do not have independent directors
on our Board of Directors. 

We
have not adopted corporate governance measures such as an audit or other independent committee of our board of directors, as we presently
do not have independent directors on our board. If we expand our board membership in future periods to include additional independent
directors, we may seek to establish an audit and other committee of our board of directors. It is possible that if our Board of Directors
included independent directors and if we were to adopt some or all of these corporate governance measures, stockholders would benefit
from somewhat greater assurance that internal corporate decisions were being made by disinterested directors and that policies had been
implemented to define responsible conduct. For example, at present in the absence of audit, nominating and compensation committees comprised
of at least a majority of independent directors, decisions concerning matters such as compensation packages or employment contracts to
our senior officers are made by a majority of directors who have an interest in the outcome of the matters being decided. However, as
a general rule, the board of directors, in making its decisions, determines first that the terms of such transaction are no less favorable
to us that those that would be available to us with respect to such a transaction from unaffiliated third parties. The company executes
the transaction between executive officers and the company once it was approved by the Board of Directors. 

Prospective
investors should bear in mind our current lack of corporate governance measures in formulating their investment decisions. 

None
of the members of our Board of Directors are considered audit committee financial experts. If we fail to maintain an effective system
of internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results. As a result, current and
potential shareholders could lose confidence in our financial reporting, which would harm our business and the trading price of our stock. 

Members
of our Board of Directors are inexperienced with U.S. GAAP and the related internal control procedures required of U.S. public companies.
Management has determined that our internal audit function is also significantly deficient due to insufficient qualified resources to
perform internal audit functions. Finally, we have not established an Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. 

We
are a development stage company with limited resources. Therefore, we cannot assure investors that we will be able to maintain effective
internal controls over financial reporting based on criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO in Internal Control-Integrated Framework. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies,
in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company s
annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. For these reasons, we are considering the
costs and benefits associated with improving and documenting our disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls and procedures,
which includes (i) hiring additional personnel with sufficient U.S. GAAP experience and (ii) implementing ongoing training in U.S. GAAP
requirements for our CFO and accounting and other finance personnel. 

If
the result of these efforts are not successful, or if material weaknesses are identified in our internal control over financial reporting,
our management will be unable to report favorably as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and/or our
disclosure controls and procedures, and we could be required to further implement expensive and time-consuming remedial measures and
potentially lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports which could have an adverse effect on
our stock price and potentially subject us to litigation. 

Because
our current officer and director owns 91 of our outstanding common stock, he could make and control corporate decisions that
may be disadvantageous to other minority shareholders and will be able to cause our company to engage in business combination without
seeking shareholder approval. 

Our
current officer and director owns 91 of the outstanding shares of our common stock as of the date of this filing. Accordingly,
they have a significant influence in determining the outcome of all corporate transactions or other matters, including mergers, consolidations
and the sale of all or substantially all of our assets. They are able to exercise complete control over the company and have the ability
to make decisions regarding, (i) whether to issue common stock and preferred stock, including decisions to issue common and preferred
stock to themselves; (ii) employment decisions, including their own compensation arrangements, (iii) the appointment of all directors;
and (iv) whether to enter into material transactions with related parties. The interests of our directors may differ from the interests
of the other stockholders and thus result in corporate decisions that are disadvantageous to other shareholders. 

6 

The
Company is subject to the 15(d) reporting requirements under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 which does not require a company to
file all the same reports and information as a fully reporting company. 

Until
our common stock is registered under the Exchange Act, we will not be a fully reporting company, but only subject to the reporting obligations
imposed by Section 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. 

Pursuant
to Section 15(d), we are required to file periodic reports with the SEC, such as annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form
10-Q, and current reports on Form 8-K, once this registration statement is declared effective, including the annual report on Form 10-K
for the fiscal year during which the registration statement is declared effective. Our registration statement was declared effective
on March 28, 2017, during the year ended September 30, 2017. That filing obligation will generally apply even if our reporting obligations
have been suspended automatically under section 15(d) of the Exchange Act prior to the due date for the Form 10-K. 

After
that fiscal year and provided the Company has less than 300 shareholders, the Company is not required to file these reports. If the reports
are not filed, the investors will have reduced visibility as to the Company and its financial condition. 

In
addition, as a filer subject to Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act, the Company is not required to prepare proxy or information statements;
our common stock will not be subject to the protection of the going private regulations; the company will be subject to only limited
portions of the tender offer rules; our officers, directors, and more than ten (10 percent shareholders are not required to file beneficial
ownership reports about their holdings in our company; that these persons will not be subject to the short-swing profit recovery provisions
of the Exchange Act; and that more than five percent (5 holders of classes of your equity securities will not be required to report
information about their ownership positions in the securities. 

We
will not be required to evaluate our internal control over financial reporting under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act until the
end of the second fiscal year reported upon in our second annual report on form 10-K. 

The
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the new rules subsequently implemented by the Securities and Exchange Commissions, the Financial Industry
Regulatory Authority FINRA and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board have imposed various new requirements on
public companies, including requiring changes in corporate governance practices. We expect these rules and regulations to increase our
legal and financial compliance costs and to make some activities more time-consuming and costly. These costs could affect profitability
and our results of operations. 

We
are in the process of determining whether our existing internal controls over financial reporting systems are compliant with Section
404. We will not be required to conduct the evaluation of effectiveness of our internal controls until the end of the fiscal year reported
upon in our second annual report on Form 10-K. 

In
addition, because we are a smaller reporting company, we are not required to obtain the auditor attestation of management s evaluation
of internal controls over financial reporting. If we obtain and disclose such reports we could continue doing so at our discretion so
long as we remain a smaller reporting company. 

This
process of internal control evaluation and attestation may divert internal resources and will take a significant amount of time, effort
and expense to complete. If it is determined that we are not in compliance with Section 404, we may be required to implement new internal
control procedures and re-evaluate our financial reporting. If we are unable to implement these changes effectively or efficiently, it
could harm our operations, financial reporting or financial results, which could adversely affect our ability to comply with our periodic
reporting obligations under the Exchange Act.

Risks
Related to our Common Stock and this Offering 

Because
we do not intend to pay any cash dividends on our common stock, our stockholders will not be able to receive a return on their shares
unless they sell them. 

We
intend to retain any future earnings to finance the development and expansion of our business. We have never paid any cash dividends
and currently do not intend to pay any dividends for the foreseeable future. To the extent that we require additional funding currently
not provided for in our financing plan, our funding sources may likely prohibit the payment of a dividend. Because we do not intend to
declare dividends, any gain on an investment in Kinetic Group Inc. will need to come through appreciation of the stock s price. 

FINRA
sales practice requirements may limit a stockholder s ability to buy and sell our stock. 

In
addition to the penny stock rules described below, FINRA has adopted rules that require that in recommending an investment
to a customer, a broker-dealer must have reasonable grounds for believing that the investment is suitable for that customer. Prior to
recommending speculative low priced securities to their non-institutional customers, broker-dealers must make reasonable efforts to obtain
information about the customer s financial status, tax status, investment objectives and other information. Under interpretations
of these rules, FINRA believes that there is a high probability that speculative low priced securities will not be suitable for at least
some customers. The FINRA requirements make it more difficult for broker-dealers to recommend that their customers buy our common stock,
which may have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity in our common stock. As a result, fewer broker-dealers may be willing
to make a market in our common stock, reducing a stockholder s ability to resell shares of our common stock. 

Our
common stock was accepted for quotation on the OTC Bulletin Board and OTC Link during the year ended September 30, 2018. As a result,
the application of the Penny Stock rules could adversely affect the market price of our common shares and increase your
transaction costs to sell those shares. The Securities and Exchange Commission has adopted Rule 3A51-1, which establishes the definition
of a Penny Stock, for the purposes relevant to us, as any equity security that has market price of less than 5.00 per
share or within an exercise price of less than 5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions. For any transaction involving a penny
stock, unless exempt, Rule 15G-9 require: 

- 
 that
 a broker or dealer approve a person s account for transactions in penny stocks; and 

- 
 the
 broker or dealer receive from the investor a written agreement to the transaction, setting forth the identity and quantity of the
 penny stock to be purchased. 

In
order to approve a person s account for transactions in penny stocks, the broker or dealer must: 

- 
 obtain
 financial information and investment experience objectives of the person; and 

- 
 make
 a reasonable determination that the transactions in penny stocks are suitable for that person and the person has sufficient knowledge
 and experience in financial matters to be capable of evaluating the risks of transactions in penny stocks. 

The
broker or dealer must also deliver, prior to any transaction in a penny stock, a disclosure schedule prescribed by the SEC relating to
the penny stock market, which, in highlight form: 

- 
 sets
 forth the basis on which the broker or dealer made the suitability determination; and 

- 
 that
 the broker or dealer received a signed, written agreement from the investor prior to the transaction. 

Generally,
brokers may be less willing to execute transactions in securities subject to the penny stock rules. This may make it more
difficult for investors to dispose of our common stock and cause a decline in the market value of our stock.

You
may face significant restrictions on the resale of your shares due to state blue sky laws. 

Each
state has its own securities laws, often called blue sky laws, which (1) limit sales of securities to a state s residents
unless the securities are registered in that state or qualify for an exemption from registration, and (2) govern the reporting requirements
for broker-dealers doing business directly or indirectly in the state. Before a security is sold in a state, there must be a registration
in place to cover the transaction, or it must be exempt from registration. The applicable broker-dealer must also be registered in that
state. We do not know whether our securities will be registered or exempt from registration under the laws of any state. A determination
regarding registration will be made by those broker-dealers, if any, who agree to serve as market makers for our common stock. There
may be significant state blue sky law restrictions on the ability of investors to sell, and on purchasers to buy, our securities. You
should therefore consider the resale market for our common stock to be limited, as you may be unable to resell your shares without the
significant expense of state registration or qualification. 

You
could be diluted from our future issuance of capital stock and derivative securities. 

As
of September 30, 2021, we had 23,710,200 shares of common stock outstanding and no shares of preferred stock outstanding. We are authorized
to issue up to 75,000,000 shares of common stock and no shares of preferred stock. To the extent of such authorization, our Board of
Directors will have the ability, without seeking stockholder approval, to issue additional shares of common stock or preferred stock
in the future for such consideration as the Board of Directors may consider sufficient. The issuance of additional common stock or preferred
stock in the future may reduce your proportionate ownership and voting power. 

If
a market develops for our shares, sales of our shares relying upon Rule 144 may depress prices in that market by a material amount. 

As
of September 30, 2021, 2,007,600 of the outstanding shares of our Common Stock are unrestricted securities 
within the meaning of Rule 144 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. As unrestricted securities, these shares may be resold under
the requirements of Rule 144 or other applicable exemptions from registration under the Act and as required under applicable state securities
laws. 

We
intend to sell more restricted shares or securities convertible into restricted shares as part of our efforts to finance the Company s
operations. As a result of revisions to Rule 144, there is no limit on the amount of restricted securities that may be sold by a non-affiliate
(i.e., a stockholder who has not been an officer, director or control person for at least 90 consecutive days) after the restricted securities
have been held by the owner for a period of one year. A sale under Rule 144 or under any other exemption from the Act, if available,
or pursuant to registration of shares of Common Stock of present stockholders, may have a depressive effect upon the price of the Common
Stock in any market that may develop.

 MANAGEMENT S
 DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

The
following discussion should be read in conjunction with our audited financial statements and notes thereto included herein. In connection
with, and because we desire to take advantage of, the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform
Act of 1995, we caution readers regarding certain forward looking statements in the following discussion and elsewhere in this report
and in any other statement made by, or on our behalf, whether or not in future filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 

Forward-looking
statements are statements not based on historical information and which relate to future operations, strategies, financial results or
other developments. Forward looking statements are necessarily based upon estimates and assumptions that are inherently subject to significant
business, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond our control and many of which, with respect
to future business decisions, are subject to change. These uncertainties and contingencies can affect actual results and could cause
actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statements made by, or our behalf. We disclaim any obligation
to update forward-looking statements. 

Results
of operations for the years ended September 30, 2021 and 2020. 

Revenue 

We
generate revenue from sales of our marketing and web development services directly to small and medium-sized businesses. We acquire customers
through direct telemarketing, referrals and our primary website that provides a description of our company and our service offerings
(www.groupkinetic.com). 

Our
gross revenue from the provision of services for the years ended September 30, 2021 and 2020 was 0 and 0 respectively. Our cost of
revenues for the year ended September 30, 2021 was 0 resulting in a gross income of 0.

As

Liquidity 

Our
internal liquidity is provided by our operations. During the years ended September 30, 2021 and 2020 the Company reported net loss from
operations of 21,000 and 14,819, respectively. 

To
date we have financed our operations by cash generated from sales of our services and shares of our common stock. We were able to sustain
our operations by increasing the number of our clients and providing additional services to our existing clients. 

Since
inception, we have sold 2,750,000 shares of common stock at 0.001 per share to our officers and directors for total proceeds of 2,750. 

11 

If
we are not successful in expanding our clientele base, maintaining profitability and positive cash flow, additional capital may be required
to maintain ongoing operations. 

We
have explored and are continuing to explore options to provide additional financing to fund future operations as well as other possible
courses of action. Such actions include, but are not limited to, securing lines of credit, sales of debt or equity securities (which
may result in dilution to existing shareholders), loans and cash advances from our directors or other third parties, and other similar
actions. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional funding (if needed), on acceptable terms or at all, through
a sale of our common stock, loans from financial institutions, our directors, or other third parties, or any of the actions discussed
above. If we cannot sustain profitable operations, and additional capital is unavailable, lack of liquidity could have a material adverse
effect on our business viability, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

Report
of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 

 To
the shareholders and the board of directors of Kinetic Group Inc 

Opinion
on the Financial Statements 

We
have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Kinetic Group Inc (the Company as of September 30, 2021, the related
consolidated statements of operations, changes in shareholders equity and cash flows ,
for each of the two years in the period ended September 30, 2021, and the related notes collectively referred to as the financial
statements. 

In
our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of September
30, 2021, and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year ended September 30, 2021, in conformity with U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles. 

Going
Concern 

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming the company will continue as a going concern as disclosed in Note 3 to
the financial statement, the Company has continuously incurred a net loss of 21,000 for the year ended September 30, 2021, and an accumulated
deficit of 197,922 at September 30, 2021. The continuation of the Company as a going concern through September 30, 2021, is dependent
upon improving the profitability and the continuing financial support from its stockholders. Management believes the existing shareholders
or external financing will provide the additional cash to meet the Company s obligations as they become due. 

These
factors raise substantial doubt about the company ability to continue as a going concern. These financial statements do not include any
adjustments that might result from the outcome of the uncertainty. 

Basis
for Opinion 

These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s
financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal
securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits
in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance
about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing
procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures
that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management,
as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for
our opinion. The company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting.
As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose
of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express
no such opinion

 NOTES
TO THE SEPTEMBER 30, 2021, AND 2020 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

Financial
assets are considered Level 3 when their fair values are determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies or similar
techniques and at least one significant model assumption or input is unobservable. 

The
fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and
the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. If the inputs used to measure the financial assets and liabilities fall within more than
one level described above, the categorization is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of
the instrument. 

The
carrying amount of the Company s financial assets and liabilities, such as cash, prepaid expenses, accounts payable and accrued
expenses, approximate their fair value because of the short maturity of those instruments. 

Transactions
involving related parties cannot be presumed to be carried out on an arm s-length basis, as the requisite conditions of competitive,
free-market dealings may not exist. Representations about transactions with related parties, if made, shall not imply that the related
party transactions were consummated on terms equivalent to those that prevail in arm s-length transactions unless such representations
can be substantiated. 

The
disclosures shall include: a. the nature of the relationship(s) involved; b. a description of the transactions, including transactions
to which no amounts or nominal amounts were ascribed, for each of the periods for which income statements are presented, and such other
information deemed necessary to an understanding of the effects of the transactions on the financial statements; c. the dollar amounts
of transactions for each of the periods for which income statements are presented and the effects of any change in the method of establishing
the terms from that used in the preceding period; and d. amounts due from or to related parties as of the date of each balance sheet
presented and, if not otherwise apparent, the terms and manner of settlement. 

Under
this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are based on the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets
and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. Deferred tax assets
are reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent management concludes it is more likely than not that the assets will not be realized.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those
temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. 

The
effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the statements of operations in the period that
includes the enactment date. 

The
Company adopted the provisions of paragraph 740-10-25-13 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification. Paragraph 740-10-25-13 addresses
the determination of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements.
Under paragraph 740-10-25-13, the Company may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than
not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. 

. Paragraph 740-10-25-13 also provides guidance on de-recognition,
classification, interest and penalties on income taxes, accounting in interim periods and requires increased disclosures. 

The
estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities are reported in the accompanying
balance sheets, as well as tax credit carry-backs and carry-forwards. The Company periodically reviews the recoverability of deferred
tax assets recorded on its balance sheets and provides valuation allowances as management deems necessary. 

Management
makes judgments as to the interpretation of the tax laws that might be challenged upon an audit and cause changes to previous estimates
of tax liability. In addition, the Company operates within multiple taxing jurisdictions and is subject to audit in these jurisdictions.
In management s opinion, adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for all years. If actual taxable income by tax jurisdiction
varies from estimates, additional allowances or reversals of reserves may be necessary. 

unrecognized tax liabilities or benefits in accordance with the provisions

Pursuant
to ASC Paragraphs 260-10-45-45-21 through 260-10-45-45-23 Diluted EPS shall be based on the most advantageous conversion rate or exercise
price from the standpoint of the security holder. The dilutive effect of outstanding call options and warrants (and their equivalents)
issued by the reporting entity shall be reflected in diluted EPS by application of the treasury stock method unless the provisions of
paragraphs 260-10-45-35 through 45-36 and 260-10-55-8 through 55-11 require that another method be applied. 

Equivalents
of options and warrants include non-vested stock granted to employees, stock purchase contracts, and partially paid stock subscriptions
(see paragraph 260 10 55 23). Anti-dilutive contracts, such as purchased put options and purchased call options, shall
be excluded from diluted EPS. Under the treasury stock method: a. Exercise of options and warrants shall be assumed at the beginning
of the period (or at time of issuance, if later) and common shares shall be assumed to be issued. b. The proceeds from exercise shall
be assumed to be used to purchase common stock at the average market price during the period. (See paragraphs 260-10-45-29 and 260-10-55-4
through 55-5.) c. The incremental shares (the difference between the number of shares assumed issued and the number of shares assumed
purchased) shall be included in the denominator of the diluted EPS computation.

which raises substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. 

The
Company is attempting to generate sufficient revenue; however, the Company s cash position may not be sufficient to support the
Company s daily operations. Management intends to raise additional funds by way of a private or public offering. While the Company
believes in the viability of its strategy to continue operations and generate sufficient revenue and in its ability to raise additional
funds, there can be no assurances to that effect. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the Company s
ability to further implement its business plan and generate sufficient revenue and its ability to raise additional funds by way of a
public or private offering. 

The
financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the
amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.

to these net operating loss carry-forwards in the accompanying financial statements because the Company believes that the realization
of the Company s net deferred tax assets of approximately , was not considered more likely than not and accordingly, the
potential tax benefits of the net loss carry-forwards are fully offset by a full valuation allowance.

Deferred
tax assets consist primarily of the tax effect of NOL carry-forwards. The Company has provided a full valuation allowance on the deferred
tax assets because of the uncertainty regarding its realizability. The valuation allowance increased approximately 0 during the year
ended September 30, 2021. 

We
follow ASC 740 Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes . Under ASC 740, tax benefits are recognized only for tax positions that
are more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by tax authorities. The amount recognized is measured as the largest amount
of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement. Unrecognized tax benefits are tax benefits
claimed in our tax returns that do not meet these recognition and measurement standards. We had liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits
at September 30, 2021 and 2020. 

Our
policy is to recognize potential interest and penalties accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits within income tax expense. For the
years ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, we did not recognize any interest or penalties in our statement of operations, nor did we have
any interest or penalties accrued in our balance sheet at September 30, 2021 and 2020 relating to unrecognized tax benefits.

 CONTROLS
 AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls 

We
evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the 2021 fiscal year. This evaluation was conducted
with the participation of our chief executive officer and our principal accounting officer. 

Disclosure
controls are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information that we are required to be disclosed in the reports
we file pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported. 

Limitations
on the Effective of Controls 

Our
management does not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal controls over financial reporting will prevent all error and
fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, but no absolute, assurance that the
objectives of a control system are met. Further, any control system reflects limitations on resources, and the benefits of a control
system must be considered relative to its costs. These limitations also include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be
faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual
acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by management override of a control. A design of a control system is also
based upon certain assumptions about potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,
or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective
control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and may not be detected. 

Conclusions 

Based
upon their evaluation of our controls, the chief executive officer and principal accounting officer have concluded that, subject to the
limitations noted above, the disclosure controls are effective providing reasonable assurance that material information relating to us
is made known to management on a timely basis during the period when our reports are being prepared. There were no changes in our internal
controls that occurred during the year covered by this report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect
our internal controls.
