ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

Star Alliance International Corp. the

April 17, 2014 under the laws of the State of Nevada. Our prior business plans, which generated limited or no earnings, included interior
decorating products, and a travel and tourism service. 

On May 14, 2018, Richard Carey our President and
Chairman of the Board, acquired 22,000,000 shares of common stock of the Company, representing 62.15 ownership of the Company which constitutes
control. Mr. Carey accepted the positions of President and Chairman of the Board on the same day. 

On May 17, 2018, Mr. Carey appointed Alexei Tchernov
as CEO and Director, Franz Allmayer as Vice President and Director, John C. Baird as CFO and Director and Themis Gladman as Secretary
and Director. 

On May 22, 2019, the Board discussed the positions of the Directors

In August 14, 2018, the Company entered into an
Exclusive Option Agreement (the Agreement with Starving Lion, Inc. Lion ). Under the Agreement, the Company
has been granted the exclusive option, for a period of six (6) months, to acquire the assets from Starving Lion, Inc. specified under
the June 4, 2018 Letter of Intent. The assets pertain mainly to two mines located in Guatemala; one is a magnesium mine in El Progresso,
and the other is a gold mine in Livingston. 

The required purchase price for the Starving Lion,
Inc. assets will be 1,000,000 cash, together with the issuance to Lion of new common and/or preferred stock to represent fifty-eight
percent (58 of the Company s issued and outstanding common stock on a fully-diluted, post-closing basis. The Company decided not
to proceed with this potential acquisition at this time. 

On October 25, 2018, Star entered into a Letter

and on March 25, 2019 and on August 5th this LOI was extended. Troy is the owner of 78 gold mining claims consisting of approximately

Employees 

Management of the Company expect to use consultants,
attorneys and accountants as necessary, and does not anticipate a need to engage any full-time employees so long as it is seeking and
evaluating business opportunities. The need for employees and their availability will be addressed in connection with the decision whether
or not to acquire or participate in specific business opportunities. 

Smaller Reporting Company Status 

We qualify as a smaller reporting company 
under Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act, which is defined as a company with a public equity float of less than 75 million. To the extent
that we remain a smaller reporting company at such time as are no longer an emerging growth company, we will still have reduced disclosure
requirements for our public filings, some of which are similar to those of an emerging growth company, including not being required to
comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the reduced disclosure obligations regarding
executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements. 

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 

We are a smaller reporting company as defined
by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information required under this item. 

Item 1B Unresolved Staff Comments 

Not applicable 

Item 2. Properties 

We currently do not own or rent any property. 

Item 3. Legal Proceedings 

Management is not aware of any legal proceedings
contemplated by any governmental authority or any other party involving us or our properties. As of the date of this year-end report,
no director, officer or affiliate is (i) a party adverse to us in any legal proceeding, or (ii) has an adverse interest to us in any legal
proceedings. Management is not aware of any other legal proceedings pending or that have been threatened against us or our properties. 

Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures 

Not applicable.

PART II 

Item 5. Market for Registrant s Common
Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities. 

Market Information 

There is a limited public market for our common
shares. Our common shares are quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board at this time. Trading in stocks quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board is often
thin and is characterized by wide fluctuations in trading prices due to many factors that may be unrelated to a company s operations
or business prospects. We cannot assure you that there will be a market in the future for our common stock. 

OTC Bulletin Board securities are not listed or
traded on the floor of an organized national or regional stock exchange. Instead, OTC Bulletin Board securities transactions are conducted
through a telephone and computer network connecting dealers in stocks. OTC Bulletin Board issuers are traditionally smaller companies
that do not meet the financial and other listing requirements of a regional or national stock exchange. 

As of June 30, 2020, the shares of our common
stock have been trading. 

Number of Holders 

As of June 30, 2021, the 135,124,028 issued and
outstanding shares of common stock were held by a total of 92 shareholders of record. 

Dividends 

No cash dividends have been paid on our shares
of common stock during the fiscal years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020. We have not paid any cash dividends since our inception and do not
foresee declaring any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. 

Recent Sales of Unregistered Securities

During the year ended June 30, 2021, the Company
sold 9,381,250 shares of common stock for total cash proceeds of 97,119. As of June 30, 2021, 33,000 shares have not yet been issued
by the transfer agent and therefore have been credited to common stock to be issued. 

Purchase of our Equity Securities by Officers
and Directors 

On July 2, 2020, the Board granted all 1,000,000
shares of the Series A preferred stock to the Company s Chairman and CEO, Richard Carey, in conversion of 68,556 of accrued compensation. 

Other Stockholder Matters 

None. 

Item 6. Selected Financial Data. 

Not applicable.

Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 

You should read the following discussion and analysis
of our financial condition and results of operations together with our financial statements and the related notes and other financial
information included elsewhere in this Form 10-K. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere
in this Form 10-K, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business and related financing, includes forward-looking
statements that involve risks and uncertainties. 

Our cash balance was 6,789 as of June 30, 2021.
We believe our cash balance is not sufficient to fund our limited levels of operations for any period of time. We have been utilizing
funds raised from the sale of shares and borrowed from our Chairman. The Chairman has no commitment, arrangement or legal obligation to
advance or loan funds to the company. The borrowing is non-interest-bearing, unsecured, and due on demand. 

Our independent registered public accountants
have issued a going concern opinion. This means that there is substantial doubt that we can continue as an on-going business for the next
twelve months unless we obtain additional capital to pay our bills. The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming
that the Company continues as a going concern, which contemplates continuity of operations, realization of assets, and liquidation of
liabilities in the normal course of business. As shown in the accompanying financial statements, the Company has accumulated deficit of
 3,172,791 and negative working capital of 737,878 as of June 30, 2021, and net loss of 503,517 and no cash flows in operating activities
for the year ended June 30, 2021. Due to these conditions, it raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. 

We are an emerging growth company 
as defined in the JOBS Act, and we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to
other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to: not required to comply with
the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act; reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation
in our periodic reports and proxy statements; exemptions from the requirements of holding an annual non-binding advisory vote on executive
compensation and nonbinding stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. In addition, Section 107 of
the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided
in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging
growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies.
We are choosing to opt out of such extended transition period, and as a result, we will comply with new or revised accounting
standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for non-emerging growth companies. Section 107 of the
JOBS Act provides that our decision to opt out of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards
is irrevocable. 

Results of Operations for the years ended
June 30, 2021 and 2020 

Operating expenses 

 General and administrative expenses were 94,508
for the year ended June 30, 2021, compared to 75,110 for the year ended June 30, 2020, an increase of 19,398. The increase is due to
an increase in filing fees and consulting expenses. 

Professional fees were 57,029 for the year ended
June 30, 2021, compared to 144,980 for the year ended June 30, 2020, a decrease of 87,951. Professional fees consist mainly of legal,
accounting and audit expense. The decrease is due to a reduction in legal and audit fees. 

Other income (expense) 

 For the year ended June 30, 2021, we had interest
expense of 10,800 and a net loss on conversion of debt of 42,330 compared to interest expense of 4,590 for the year ended June 30,
2020. In addition, there was a loss on conversion of accrued salaries of 0 for the year ended June 30, 2021 and 148,000 for the year
ended June 30, 2020. Interest expense has increased as a result of notes payable that were added to the Company s liabilities. 

Net Loss 

 Net loss for the year ended June 30, 2021 was
 503,017 compared to 1,894,320 for the year ended June 30, 2020. 

4 

Plan of Operations 

We expect that working capital requirements will
continue to be funded through borrowing from related parties. Subsequent to the year end the Company acquired the mining claims and equipment
assets of Troy Mining Corporation. We continue to search for other new business opportunities in the mining arena. 

Off Balance Sheet Arrangements 

We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that
have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues
or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. 

Material Commitments 

As of the date of this Annual Report, we do not
have any material commitments. 

Purchase of Significant Equipment 

We do not intend to purchase any significant equipment
during the next twelve months. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

The accompanying financial statements have been
prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates continuity of operations, realization of assets,
and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. As shown in the accompanying financial statements, the Company has an
accumulated deficit of 2,669,774 and negative working capital of 178,985 as of June 30, 2020. For the year ended June 30, 2021 the Company
had a net loss of 503,017 with 355,574 of cash used in operating activities. Due to these conditions, it raises substantial doubt about
the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. 

Net cash used in operating activities was 355,574 for the year ended
June 30, 2021 as compared to the net cash used in operating activities of 135,591 for the year ended June 30, 2020. The increase in net
cash used in operating activities from 2020 to 2021 is because expense increases during the year ended June 30, 2021. 

Net cash provided by financing activities was
 342,305 and 155,178 for the years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. 

Over the next twelve months, we expect our principle
source of liquidity may be dependent on borrowings from related parties. 

Going Concern Consideration 

Our auditors have issued a going concern 
opinion, meaning that there is substantial doubt if we can continue as an on-going business for the next twelve months unless we obtain
additional capital. The Company s cash position may not be sufficient to support its daily operations. 

Limited operating history and need for additional
capital 

There is no historical financial information about
us upon which to base an evaluation of our performance. We are in start-up stage operations and have not generated any significant revenues.
We cannot guarantee we will be successful in our business operations. Our business is subject to risks inherent in the establishment of
a new business enterprise, including limited capital resources and possible cost overruns due to price and cost increases in services
and products.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED
PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders 
Star Alliance International Corp. 

Opinion on the Financial Statements 

We have audited the accompanying balance sheets
of Star Alliance International Corp. (the Company) as of June 30, 2021 and the related statement of operations, stockholders deficit
and cash flows for the period then ended and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements). In our opinion,
the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of June 30, 2021, and the
results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the period then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States of America. 

Basis for Opinion 

These financial statements are the responsibility
of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our
audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required
to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations
of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We conducted our audit in accordance with the
standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged
to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audit, we are required to obtain an understanding
of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s
internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our audit included performing procedures to assess
the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud and performing procedures that respond to
those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating
the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion 

 . 

 Going Concern Uncertainty 

The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that
the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in note 3 to the financial statements, the Company has negative
working capital of 737,878, has incurred losses since inception of 3,172,791. For the year ended June 30, 2021, the Company had a net
loss of 503,517. These factors create an uncertainty as to the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. Management s
plans in regard to these matters are also described in note 3. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result
from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

Emphasis of Matters-Risks and Uncertainties 

The Company is not able to predict the ultimate
impact that COVID -19 will have on its business. However, if the current economic conditions continue, the pandemic could have an adverse
impact on the economies and 
financial markets of many countries, including the geographical area in which the Company plans to operate. 

Emphasis of Matters-Risks and Uncertainties 

The Company has had significant transactions and
relationships with related parties, including the Company s Co-Chairman, which are described in the financial statements. Transactions
involving related parties cannot be presumed to be carried out on an arm s length basis, as the requisite conditions of competitive,
free market dealings may not exist. 

We have served as the Company s auditor since 2021.

Company had a net loss of 1,894,320. These factors create an uncertainty as to the Company s ability to continue as a going concern.
Management s plans in regard to these matters are also described in note 3. The financial statements do not include any adjustments
that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

Star Alliance International Corp . 

 Notes to Financial Statements 

 June 30, 2021 

NOTE 1 NATURE OF BUSINESS 

Star Alliance
International Corp. the Company , we , us was originally incorporated with the name Asteriko
Corp. in the State of Nevada on April 17, 2014 under the laws of the state of Nevada, for the purpose of acquiring and developing gold
mining as well as certain other mining properties worldwide. 

NOTE 2 SIGNIFICANT AND CRITICAL ACCOUNTING
POLICIES AND PRACTICES 

Basis of Presentation 

 The accompanying financial statements of the Company
have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America U.S. GAAP and the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC ). 

Use of Estimates 

 The preparation of financial statements in conformity
with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts
of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 

Cash equivalents 

 The Company considers all highly liquid investments
with a maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. There were no cash equivalents for the years ended June
30, 2021 or 2020. 

Long Lived Assets 

 Property consists of mining equipment not yet
used. Our company assesses the impairment of long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
value may not be recoverable. When we determine that the carrying value of long-lived assets may not be recoverable based upon the existence
of one or more indicators of impairment and the carrying value of the asset cannot be recovered from projected undiscounted cash flows,
we record an impairment charge. Our company measures any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount
rate determined by management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in the current business model. Significant management judgment
is required in determining whether an indicator of impairment exists and in projecting cash flows. 

Stock-based Compensation 

 The Company records stock-based compensation in
accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718, Compensation Stock Compensation . FASB ASC Topic 718 requires companies
to measure compensation cost for stock-based employee compensation at fair value at the grant date and recognize the expense over the
employee s requisite service period. The Company recognizes in the statement of operations the grant-date fair value of stock options
and other equity-based compensation issued to employees and non-employees. The Company accounts for stock-based compensation in accordance
with the provision of ASC 505-50, Equity Based Payments to Non-Employees , which requires that such equity instruments are recorded
at their fair value on the measurement date. The measurement of stock-based compensation is subject to periodic adjustment as the underlying
equity instruments vest. 

13 

Fair value of financial instruments 

 The Company follows paragraph 825-10-50-10 of
the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for disclosures about fair value of its financial instruments and paragraph 820-10-35-37 of
the FASB Accounting Standards Codification Paragraph 820-10-35-37 to measure the fair value of its financial instruments.
Paragraph 820-10-35-37 establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America (U.S. GAAP), and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. To increase consistency and comparability in fair
value measurements and related disclosures, Paragraph 820-10-35-37 establishes a fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs to
valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three (3) broad levels. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority
to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. The
three (3) levels of fair value hierarchy defined by Paragraph 820-10-35-37 are described below: 

Level 1 - Quoted market prices available in active
markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access at the measurement date. 

Level 2 - Inputs include quoted prices for similar
assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active,
inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability (e.g., interest rates, yield curves, etc.), and inputs
that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means (market corroborated inputs). 

Level 3 - Unobservable inputs that reflect our
assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. 

The Company s financial instruments are
consisted principally of accrued expenses and short term debt. The carrying amounts of such financial instruments in the accompanying
balance sheets approximate their fair values due to their relatively short-term nature. 

Net income (loss) per common share 

 Net loss per common share is computed pursuant
to section 260-10-45 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification. Basic net loss per common share is computed by dividing net loss by
the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted net loss per common share is computed by
dividing net loss by the weighted average number of shares of common stock and potentially dilutive outstanding shares of common stock
during the period to reflect the potential dilution that could occur from common shares issuable through contingent share arrangements,
stock options and warrants. The diluted loss per share is the same as the basic loss per share for the years ended July 31, 2021 and 2020,
as the inclusion of any potential shares would have had an antidilutive effect due to our loss from operations. 

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements

In November 2019, the
FASB issued ASU 2019-10, Financial Instruments Credit Losses (Topic 326), Derivative and Hedging (Topic 815), and Leases (Topic
842). This new guidance became effective for us on January 1, 2020. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact
on the Company s consolidated financial statements. 

On January 1, 2020 the
Company adopted ASU 2017-04, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment . The
ASU eliminates Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test and the qualitative assessment for any reporting unit with a zero or negative carrying
amount. The ASU also requires an entity to disclose the amount of goodwill allocated to each reporting unit with a zero or negative carrying
amount. The adoption did not have an impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements. 

In August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06 , Debt Debt
with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging Contracts in Entity s Own Equity (Subtopic
815-40) Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity s Own Equity. ASU 2020-06 reduces the number
of accounting models for convertible debt instruments and convertible preferred stock. For convertible instruments with conversion features
that are not required to be accounted for as derivatives under Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging , or that do not result in
substantial premiums accounted for as paid-in capital, the embedded conversion features no longer are separated from the host contract.
ASU 2020-06 also removes certain conditions that should be considered in the derivatives scope exception evaluation under Subtopic 815-40, Derivatives
and Hedging Contracts in Entity s Own Equity , and clarify the scope and certain requirements under Subtopic 815-40. In
addition, ASU 2020-06 improves the guidance related to the disclosures and earnings-per-share (EPS) for convertible instruments and contract
in entity s own equity. ASU 2020-06 is effective for public business entities that meet the definition of a Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC) filer, excluding entities eligible to be smaller reporting companies as defined by the SEC, for fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 2021, including interim periods within those fiscal years. For all other entities, the amendments are effective for
fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted, but
no earlier than fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Board specified
that an entity should adopt the guidance as of the beginning of its annual fiscal year. The Company is currently evaluation the impact
this ASU will have on its financial statements. 

The Company has implemented all new accounting
pronouncements that are in effect. These pronouncements did not have any material impact on the financial statements unless otherwise
disclosed, and the Company does not believe that there are any other new accounting pronouncements that have been issued that might have
a material impact on its financial position or results of operations. 

14 

NOTE 3 GOING CONCERN 

The accompanying financial statements have
been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates continuity of operations, realization
of assets, and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. As shown in the accompanying financial statements, the
Company has an accumulated deficit of 3,172,791 and negative working capital of 230,346 as of June 30, 2021. For the year ended
June 30, 2021 the Company had a net loss of 503,017, with 355,574 of cash used in operating activities. Due to these conditions,
it raises substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. 

The Company is attempting
to commence operations and generate sufficient revenue; however, the Company s cash position may not be sufficient to support its
daily operations. While the Company believes in the viability of its strategy to commence operations and generate sufficient revenue and
in its ability to raise additional funds, there can be no assurances to that effect. The ability of the Company to continue as a going
concern is dependent upon its ability to further implement its business plan and generate sufficient revenue and its ability to raise
additional funds. The financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of asset carrying
amounts or the amount and classification of liabilities that may result should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. 

NOTE
4 ACQUISITION 

On August
13, 2019, The Company closed an Asset Purchase Agreement (the APA with Troy Mining Corporation Troy ). Under
the APA, the company acquired 78 gold mining claims consisting of approximately 4,800 acres, located east/southeast of El Portal, California,
in Mariposa County, together with all of Troy s rights to related equipment and buildings currently located on the mining claims.
In exchange for the mining claims and related assets, the company agreed to issue 1,883,000 shares of a new class of preferred

under the APA will be forfeited back to Troy. We are current on all the terms of the agreement.

was filed on August 14, 2020. 

On July 14, 2020 a contract extension was agreed
between Star Alliance International Corporation and Troy Mining Corporation. The agreement provides for a sixty-day extension on the loan

ninety (90) days was signed between Troy Mining Corporation and Star Alliance International Corporation. A payment of 40,000 was made

NOTE 9 INCOME TAX 

Deferred taxes are provided on a liability method
whereby deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards and deferred
tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences. Temporary differences are the differences between the reported amounts
of assets and liabilities and their tax bases. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management,
it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The Company has evaluated Staff Accounting
Bulletin No. 118 regarding the impact of the decreased tax rates of the Tax Cuts Jobs Act. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment. The U.S. federal income tax rate of 21 is being used
due to the new tax law recently enacted. 

Net deferred tax assets consist of the following
components as of June 30: 

2021 
 2020 
 
 Deferred Tax Assets: 

NOL Carryover 
 666,300 
 560,650 
 
 Less valuation allowance 
 (666,300 
 (560,650 
 
 Net deferred tax assets 

At June 30, 2021, the Company had net operating
loss carry forwards of approximately 666,300 that may be offset against future taxable income. No tax benefit has been reported
in the June 30, 2021 or 2020 financial statements since the tax benefit is offset by a valuation allowance of the same amount. 

17 

On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted
comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cut and Jobs Act (the Tax Act ). The Tax Act establishes new
tax laws that affects 2018 and future years, including a reduction in the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate to 21 effective January
1, 2018. 

Due to the change in ownership provisions of the
Tax Reform Act of 1986, net operating loss carry forwards for federal income tax reporting purposes are subject to annual limitations. Should
a change in ownership occur, net operating loss carry forwards may be limited as to use in future years. 

ASC Topic 740 provides guidance on the accounting
for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a company s financial statements. Topic 740 requires a company to determine whether
it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination based upon the technical merits of the position. If
the more-likely-than-not threshold is met, a company must measure the tax position to determine the amount to recognize in the financial
statements. 

The Company includes interest and penalties arising
from the underpayment of income taxes in the statements of operations in the provision for income taxes. As of June 30, 2021, the Company
had no accrued interest or penalties related to uncertain tax positions. 

With few exceptions, the Company is no longer
subject to U.S. federal, state and local income tax examinations by tax authorities for years before 2015. 

NOTE 10 SUBSEQUENT EVENTS 

Management has evaluated subsequent events pursuant
to the requirements of ASC Topic 855, from the balance sheet date through the date the financial statements were available to be issued,
and has determined that no material subsequent events exist other than the following. 

Subsequent to June 30, 2021, the Company sold
6,020,000 for total cash proceeds of 550,000. 

On July 5, 2021, the Company issued 4,770,000
shares of common stock that were sold for 35,000 prior to June 30, 2021. 

Subsequent to June 30, 2021, the Company paid
an invoice of 20,000 for services with 4,444 shares of common stock.

Item 9A. Controls and Procedures 

Management s Conclusions Regarding Effectiveness
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

As required by Rule 13a-15
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as of June 30, 2020, the end of the year covered by this report, our management concluded its
evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. 

Disclosure controls and procedures
refer to controls and other procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit under
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and
forms of the SEC and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer and
chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating our disclosure
controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide
only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating
and implementing possible controls and procedures. 

Our management does not expect
that our disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated,
can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system s objectives will be met. Further, the design of a
control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to
their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that
all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments
in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. The design of any system of controls
is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed
in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. 

With respect to the fiscal
year ending June 30, 2020, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness
of the design and operations of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) promulgated under
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Based upon our evaluation regarding the fiscal year ending June 30, 2019, our management, including
our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, has concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were ineffective. 

Management s Report on Internal Control
over Financial Reporting 

Our management
is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)
under the Securities Exchange Act. Our management is also required to assess and report on the effectiveness of our internal control over
financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 Section 404 ). Management assessed
the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2019. In making this assessment, we used the criteria
set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control - Integrated Framework. Based
on that evaluation, our management concluded that our internal controls over financial reporting were not effective as of such date to
ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms. We note the following deficiencies that management believes
to be material weaknesses: 

The Company s lack of segregation of duties. 

Lack of an audit committee and independent directors 

Management has not established appropriate and rigorous procedures for evaluating internal controls over financial reporting. Due to limited resources and lack of segregation of duties, documentation of the limited control structure has not been accomplished. 

We employ policies and procedures for reconciliation of the financial statements and note disclosures, however, these processes are not appropriately documented. 

Management has not established methodical and consistent data back-up procedures to ensure loss of data will not occur. 

19 

The Company is evaluating the necessity of implementing
an independent board of directors to rectify these weaknesses. 

A material weakness
(within the meaning of PCAOB Auditing Standard No. 5) is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial
reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will
not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. A significant deficiency is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal
control over financial reporting that is less severe than a material weakness, yet important enough to merit attention by those responsible
for oversight of the company s financial reporting. 

Because of its inherent limitations,
internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance
with the policies and procedures may deteriorate. 

This annual report does not
include an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management s
report was not subject to attestation by our registered public accounting firm pursuant to temporary rules of the Securities and Exchange
Commission that permit us to provide only management s report in this annual report. 

Changes in Internal Controls 

There have been no changes
in our internal control over financial reporting during the year ended June 30, 2021 that have materially affected, or are reasonably
likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting. 

Item 9B. Other Information 

We have no other information to disclose that
was required to be disclosed in a report on Form 8-K during the fourth quarter of fiscal year ended June 30, 2021 that was not reported.
