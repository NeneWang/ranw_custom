FORM 10-K PART I ITEM 1. BUSINESS a. BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT Pismo Coast Village, Inc., the "Registrant" or the "Company," was incorporated under the laws of the State of California on April 2, 1975. The Company's sole business is owning and operating Pismo Coast Village RV Resort, a recreational vehicle resort (hereinafter the "Resort") in Pismo Beach, California. The Resort has continued to enhance its business by upgrading facilities and services to better serve customers. b. BUSINESS OF ISSUER The Company is engaged in only one business, namely, the ownership and operation of the Resort. The Company generates revenue from rental of camping sites, recreational vehicle storage, recreational vehicle repair and retail sales from a general store and recreational vehicle parts store. Accordingly, all of the revenues, operating profit (loss) and identifiable assets of the Company are attributable to a single industry segment. Pismo Coast Village RV Resort is a full-service 400-space recreational vehicle resort. Its Resort operations include site rentals, RV storage business, video arcade, laundromat, and other income sources related to the operation. The retail operations include a general store, RV parts store, and RV repair shop. In addition, the Company has a recreation department that provides a summer season youth program and recreational equipment rentals. PUBLIC AND SHAREHOLDER USERS The present policy of the Company is to offer each shareholder the opportunity for 45 nights of free use of sites at the Resort; 25 nights may be used during prime time and 20 nights during non-prime time. The free use of sites by shareholders is managed by designating the nights of the year as prime time and non-prime time. A prime time night is one that is most in demand, for example, Memorial Day Weekend and the period from June 1 until Labor Day. Non-prime time is that time with the least demand. Each shareholder is furnished annually a calendar that designates the prime and non-prime time nights; it also provides a schedule of when reservations can be made and the procedure for making reservations. Shareholder's free use of sites average approximately 21 to 24 annually (refer to Item 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, page 9). SEASONAL ASPECTS OF BUSINESS The business of the Company is seasonal and is concentrated during prime days of the year which are defined as follows: President's Day Weekend, Easter week, Memorial Day Weekend, summer vacation months, Labor Day, Thanksgiving Weekend and Christmas vacation. WORKING CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS By accumulating reserves during the prime seasons, the Company is able generally to meet its working capital needs during off-season. Industry practice is to accumulate funds during the prime season, and use such funds, as necessary, in the off-season. The Company has arranged, but not used, a 500,000 line of credit to ensure funds are available, if necessary, in the off-season. 3 

COMPETITION The Company is in competition with nine other RV parks located within a five-mile radius. Since its property is the only property located adjacent to the beach, it has a competitive edge. The Company is recognized as a recreational vehicle resort rather than a park because of its upgraded facilities and amenities, which include 66 channels of satellite TV, high-speed wireless internet service throughout the property, a heated pool, a miniature golf course and a recreational program. The Resort is noted for its ability to provide full service, which includes RV storage and RV repair and service. The Resort is consistently given high ratings by industry travel guides based on resort appearance, facilities offered, and recreational programs. In November 2007, Pismo Coast Village RV Resort was awarded the designation of 2007/2008 RV Park of the Year, Large Park Category, by the National Association of RV Parks and Campgrounds (ARVC), which has a membership of more than 3,900 properties. Pismo Coast Village RV Resort also received national Park of the Year honors in 1999, 1997, and 1995. In fiscal year 2004, Pismo Coast Village RV Resort was awarded the designation of RV Park of the Year - Mega Park Category 2004 by the California Travel Parks Association (CTPA), now known as the California Association of RV Parks and Campgrounds (CalARVC). These factors allow the Resort to price its site rental fees above most of its competition based on perceived value received. Competition for the tourist market is strong between the cities on the Central Coast of California. Resort management and staff are involved with the City of Pismo Beach, Chamber of Commerce, Conference and Visitors Bureau, and are major sponsors in cooperative events and advertising. The Resort continues to market off-season discounts and place advertisements in trade publications and industry directories. In addition, the Company places its brochure with companies selling or renting recreational vehicles and has found the Resort's website and social media to be very effective. The marketing program also targets groups and clubs by offering group discounts, meeting facilities, and catering services. The Company's marketing plan was funded 38,690 for fiscal year 2021, which was developed out of operating revenues. The major source of the Company's business is repeat business, which has been developed by attention to good customer service and providing quality recreational facilities. ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATION The Company is affected by federal, state and local antipollution laws and regulations. Due to the nature of its business operations (camping, RV storage and small retail store sales), the discharge of materials into the environment is not considered to be of a significant concern, and the EPA has not designated the Company as a potentially responsible party for clean up of hazardous waste. The main property of the Resort is located within the boundaries of those lands under the review and purview of the Coastal Commission of the State of California and the City of Pismo Beach. The water and sewer systems are serviced by the City of Pismo Beach. The Company was subject to state and federal regulations regarding the fiscal year 1996 reconstruction of an outflow structure that empties into Pismo Creek at the north boundary of the Resort. Because the Resort is within the wetlands area, the California Coastal Commission required permits for repair and construction to be reviewed by the following agencies: City of Pismo Beach, State Lands Commission, Regional Water Quality Board, State of California, California Department of Fish and Game, State Department of Parks and Recreation and the Army Corps of Engineers. EMPLOYEES As of September 30, 2021, the Company employed approximately 61 people, with 13 of these on a part-time basis and 48 on a full-time basis. Due to the seasonal nature of the business, additional staff is needed during peak periods and fewer during the off-season. Staffing levels during the fiscal year ranged from approximately 57 employees to 63 employees. Management considers its labor relations to be good. 4 

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION The Company has remained conservative when considering rates and rate increases. As a result of experiencing increasing operational expenses and conducting a local comparative rate study, the Board of Directors (Board) voted to increase all monthly trailer storage fees 6 per month effective January 1, 2021. The Board also voted at the September 2020 meeting to increase all nightly rates 5 per night effective March 1, 2021. It is anticipated the proposed rates will continue to market site usage at its highest value and not negatively impact the Company's ability to capture an optimum market share. c. REPORTS TO SECURITY HOLDERS Pismo Coast Village, Inc. files quarterly reports, an annual report, and periodic reports, providing the public with current information about the Company and its operations with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Company makes available on its website, www.pismocoastvillage.com, access to its annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and all amendments to those reports as soon as reasonably practicable after such material is electronically filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission.

The SEC maintains an internet site (http://www.sec.gov) that contains reports, proxy statements, and other information that the Company files electronically with the SEC. ITEM 2. PROPERTIES The Company's principal asset consists of the Resort, which is located at 165 South Dolliver Street in Pismo Beach, California. The Resort is built on a 26-acre site and includes 400 campsites with full hookups and nearby restrooms with showers and common facilities, such as a video arcade, recreation hall, restaurant, general store, swimming pool, laundromat, and three playgrounds. In 1980, the Company purchased a 2.1-acre parcel of real property located at 2250 22nd Street, Oceano, California, at a price of 66,564. The property is being used by the Company as a storage facility for recreational vehicles. The storage capacity of this lot is approximately 121 units. On October 20, 2014, the Company entered into a long-term lease with Verizon Wireless for the installation of a cell tower. The lease term is for five (5) years with up to four (4) additional five (5) year terms unless lessee terminates the lease at the end of the current term. In 1981, the Company exercised an option and purchased a 3.3-acre parcel located at 424 South Dolliver Street, Pismo Beach, California, at a price of 300,000. The property, which previously had been leased by the Company, is used primarily as a recreational vehicle storage yard. The storage capacity of this lot is approximately 120 units. On June 6, 2016, the Company entered into a long-term lease with Verizon Wireless for the installation of a cell tower. The lease term is for five (5) years with up to four (4) additional five (5) year terms unless lessee terminates the lease at the end of the current term. In 1988, the Company purchased approximately 0.6 acres of property at 180 South Dolliver Street, Pismo Beach, California, across the street from the main property, consisting of a large building with a storefront and one large maintenance bay in the rear. Also, on the property is a smaller garage-type building with three parking stalls. The Company enlarged its recreational vehicle repair operation, added RV storage for approximately eleven units and developed the storefront into an RV parts store. The property was purchased for 345,000, of which 300,000 was financed and paid in full during fiscal year 1997. 5 

On December 31, 1998, the Company closed escrow on a parcel of property located at 1295 Sand Dollar Avenue, Oceano, California, to be developed as an additional RV storage facility. The 5.5-acre property is located adjacent to existing Company RV storage. On October 14, 1999, construction was completed, and the Company received County approval to occupy the premises. The property was purchased for 495,000, of which 395,000 was financed and paid in full in July 2000. Development cost amounted to 195,723 and was allocated from operational cash flow. Storage capacity for this property is approximately 408 units and is currently full. On February 28, 2003, the Company closed escrow on a parcel of property to be developed as an additional RV storage facility. The 4.7-acre property is located on Fountain Avenue in Oceano, California, and was purchased for 650,000, of which 500,000 was financed. The note on this property was paid off in September 2005. The construction permit granted by the County of San Luis Obispo was contingent upon permit approval by the California Coastal Commission. In January 2006, the Commission denied the permit based on wetland conditions. The property is currently being considered for another use. Due to the continued demand for RV storage and the denial of the aforementioned permit, the Board of Directors elected to purchase additional property. On January 11, 2006, the Company closed escrow on a six-acre property located at 974 Sheridan Road, Arroyo Grande, California, previously developed as an RV storage facility. The purchase price was 2.1 million, and included approximately 80 existing storage customers. This property had been permitted and developed the previous year, and is considered in good condition with a capacity of approximately 229 units. On April 6, 2006, the Company purchased the 2.2-acre property located at 2030 Front Street in Oceano, California, that it previously rented from Union Pacific Railroad for RV storage. The purchase price was 925,000 and the condition is considered good. The lot is operating at full capacity with 181 units. On May 9, 2008, the Company closed escrow on a 19.55-acre property located at 2180 Arriba Place in Arroyo Grande, California, to be developed for RV storage. The purchase price was 3.1 million for the undeveloped land. The Company received a development permit through the County of San Luis Obispo Planning Commission. The development was completed in May 2010, and the storage capacity is expected to be approximately 900 units. On January 21, 2013, the Company entered into a long-term lease with Verizon Wireless for the installation of a cell tower. The lease term is for five (5) years with up to four (4) additional five (5) year terms unless lessee terminates the lease at the end of the current term. On May 20, 2015, the Company closed escrow on a one-acre property located at 2096 Nipomo Street in Oceano, California, to be developed as an RV Repair and Service facility. The purchase price was 425,000 and required the demolition of a two-story residence. The Company successfully expanded the usable property area by seeking road abandonment. On September 1, 2017, the Company received a Minor Use Permit with conditions from San Luis Obispo County. Construction was completed and the Certificate of Occupancy was received from the County of San Luis Obispo in March of 2021. There is no deferred maintenance on any of the Resort's facilities. The Company's facilities are in good condition and adequate to meet the needs of the shareholder users as well as the public users. The Company continues to develop sufficient revenue from general public sites sales to support a continued positive maintenance program and to meet the demands of shareholders use of free sites. Management considers the Company's insurance policies offer adequate coverage for risk and liability exposure. 6 

1. TRAILER STORAGE YARDS In 1986, the Company leased a parcel of land 100 feet wide by 960 feet long, located at 2030 Front Street in Oceano, California, from the Union Pacific Railroad Corporation. The property is being used by the Company as a storage facility for recreational vehicles. Capital improvements in the amount of 40,000 were made to this property, which provides storage for approximately 180 units. On July 29, 2005, Union Pacific Railroad Corporation sold the property to the Weyrick Family Trust, who, after entering into a five-year lease, agreed to sell the property to the Company for 925,000. This transaction was completed April 6, 2006. Associated with the previously mentioned property, and included within the fenced storage perimeter, is the lease of a ten-foot by 960-foot section belonging to Union Pacific Railroad. This lease also allows for the Company's fence to encroach upon the lessor's property. This annual lease is currently 7,379, with a 3 automatic annual increase. In 1991, the Company developed a lease for a five-acre RV storage lot at the Oceano Airport clear zone as storage for approximately 310 RVs. This lot, which is located at 1909 Delta Lane in Oceano, was developed to replace a 100-unit storage lot that was closed when the lease was not renewed. Construction was completed in January 1992 and capital improvements in the amount of 330,768 were made to this property of which 300,000 was financed and paid in full during fiscal year 1997. The original lease on the storage lot was for five years and the Company executed a third five-year option with the County of San Luis Obispo that expired December 31, 2006. In response to the Company's request for another five-year extension, the County has answered that, until the Oceano Airport Master Plan is updated, the lease will be a month-to-month holdover. On June 2, 2020, the San Luis Obispo County Board of Supervisors voted to approve a lease with the Company following the completion of the Oceano Drainage project. The initial lease term is for two years and may be extended for four additional and successive two-year terms. Monthly lease is set at 3,737 with an annual adjustment based on Consumer Price Index published in July. The Resort leases out areas to other companies to ensure that the best service and equipment are available for guest use or creates cash flow for the Company.

OVERVIEW Pismo Coast Village, Inc. operates as a 400-space recreational vehicle resort. The Company includes additional business operations to provide its users with a full range of services expected of a recreational resort. These services include a store, video arcade, laundromat, recreational vehicle repair, RV parts shop and an RV storage operation. The Company is authorized to issue 1,800 shares of one class, all with equal voting rights and all being without par value. Transfers of shares are restricted by Company bylaws. One such restriction is that transferees must acquire shares with intent to hold the same for the purpose of enjoying camping rights and other benefits to which a shareholder is entitled. Each share of stock is intended to provide the shareholder with the opportunity for 45 nights of free site use per year. However, if the Company is unable to generate sufficient funds from the public, the Company may be required to charge shareholders for services. Management is charged with the task of developing sufficient funds to operate the Resort through site sales to general public guests by allocating a minimum of 175 sites to general public use and allocating a maximum of 225 sites for shareholder free use. The other service centers are expected to generate sufficient revenue to support themselves and/or produce a profit. The Company continues to promote and depend upon recreational vehicle camping as the primary source of revenue. The rental of campsites to the general public provides income to cover expenses, complete capital improvements, and allow shareholders up to 45 free nights camping annually. Additional revenues come from RV storage and spotting, RV service and repair, on-site convenience store, and other ancillary activities such as laundromat, arcade, and bike rental. On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of a coronavirus (COVID-19) a pandemic. In response, the County of San Luis Obispo followed by the Governor of California issued a Shelter at Home order effective March 19, 2020, requiring certain non-essential businesses to temporarily close to the public. The Company began canceling reservations on March 19 and closed the park on March 23. The resort remained closed until May 22, 2020 at which time the County of San Luis Obispo permitted occupancy to fifty percent. On June 5, 2020, the County of San Luis Obispo allowed lodging businesses to operate at full capacity with restrictions on amenities. The RVing public actively seeks accommodations on the Central Coast despite volatile fuel prices and personal financial uncertainties. RVing offers an affordable outdoor recreational experience, and the Company provides quality facilities and services in a highly popular location. Site occupancy for fiscal year 2020 was down 18.0 , following the previous year s occupancy, primarily due to the impacts of COVID-19. Revenues from ancillary operations, such as the General Store, RV service, laundromat, arcade, and bike rental, were significantly decreased due to the COVID-19 closure and ongoing impact. Following the full resort reopening on June 5, 2020, the company experienced multiple months of record occupancy, including fiscal year 2021 reflecting record occupancy. This occupancy has directly impacted the increase of revenue in all segments of the company. RV storage continues to provide a significant portion of the Company s revenue. RV storage provides numerous benefits to the customer including: no stress of towing, no need to own a tow vehicle, use of RV by multiple family members, and convenience. Ongoing investment in Resort improvements has assured Resort guests and shareholders a top quality, up-to-date facility. This quality and pride of ownership was evident when the National Association of RV Parks and Campgrounds Park of the Year was awarded to the Resort for 2007 - 2008. In addition, in 2008 the Resort was the only industry rated "A" park in California for customer satisfaction based on internet visitor surveys collected nationally by Guest Reviews. The Resort also received the Guest Reviews A rated park recognition for the years 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016 and one of 30 parks nationally in 2017. 10 

The Company's commitment to quality, value, and enjoyment is underscored by the business' success due to word of mouth and referrals from guests. In addition, investment for online marketing, ads in the leading national directories, and trade magazine advertising formulates most of the business-marketing plan. CURRENT OPERATING PLANS The Board of Directors continues its previously established policy by adopting a stringent conservative budget for fiscal year 2022, which projects a positive cash flow of approximately 2,757,241 from operations. This projection is based on paid site occupancy reflecting similar occupancy as experienced in fiscal year 2019, as fiscal year 2020 occupancy was skewed due to the COVID-19 closure. The 2022 budget plan includes a 5 per night increase for all site rentals effective January 1, 2022. While the Company projects a positive cash flow, this cannot be assured for fiscal year 2022. FINANCIAL CONDITION The business of the Company is seasonal and is concentrated on prime days of the year which are defined as follows: President's Day weekend, Easter week, Memorial Day weekend, summer vacation months, Labor Day weekend, Thanksgiving week, and Christmas/New Year s week. There are no known trends that affect business or affect revenue. The Company develops its income from two sources: (a) Resort Operations, consisting of revenues generated from RV site rentals, from RV storage space operations, and lease revenues from the laundromat, arcade, restaurant operations and property leases for cell tower communications facilities by third party lessees; and (b) Retail Operations, consisting of revenues from general store operations and from RV parts and service operations. With the possibility of requiring additional funds for planned capital improvements and the winter season, the Company maintains a 500,000 Line of Credit to ensure funds will be available if required. In anticipation of future large projects, the Board of Directors has instructed management to build operational cash balances. The Company has no other liabilities to creditors other than current accounts payable arising from its normal day-to-day operations and advance Resort rental reservation deposits, none of which are in arrears. LIQUIDITY The Company's policy is to use its ability to generate operating cash flow to meet its expected future needs for internal growth. The Company has continued to maintain sufficient cash so as to not require the use of a short-term line of credit during the off-season period, and the Company expects to be able to do so (although no assurance of continued cash flow can be given). Net cash provided by operating activities totaled 3,001,405 in 2021, compared to 1,424,339 for the 2020 fiscal year. During fiscal year 2021, capital investment of 169,180 was made that included a new street sweeper, a garbage compactor container, and final construction on the RV shop. During fiscal year 2020, capital investment of 637,041 was made that included construction on the new RV service facility, and a new Hino trailer tow truck. These projects were completed on time and within budget. Fiscal year 2021's current ratio (current assets to current liabilities) of 3.06 increased from fiscal year 2019's current ratio of 2.60. The increase in current ratio is the result of increased cash and cash equivalents. Working Capital increased to 6,377,259 at the end of fiscal year 2021, compared to 4,288,675 at the end of fiscal year 2020. This increase is primarily a result of increased cash and cash equivalents as a result of increased income from Resort operations and postponement of some capital projects. 11 

CAPITAL RESOURCES AND PLANNED EXPENDITURES The Company plans capital expenditures up to 223,000 in fiscal year 2022 to further enhance the Resort facilities and services. This would include upgrading the resort WiFi system, installing six surveillance cameras on the resort, replacing two older pickups, and replacing a tractor. Funding for these projects is expected to come from normal operating cash flows and, if necessary, supplemented with outside financing. These capital expenditures are expected to increase the Resort's value to its shareholders and the general public. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS YEAR-TO-YEAR COMPARISON Revenue: Operating revenue, interest and other income increased above the prior fiscal year ended September 30, 2020, by 2,379,128, or 32.0 . REVENUE BY SEGMENT 2021 2020 OCCUPANCY of Shareholder Site Use 23.8 20.4 of Paid Site Rental 65.4 47.1 Total Site Occupancy 87.5 67.7 of Storage Rental 99.0 99.0 Average Paid Site 67.27 64.8 RESORT OPERATIONS Site Rental 6,421,329 4,469,703 Storage Operations 1,895,295 1,788,939 Support Operations 188,275 121,726 Total 8,504,899 6,380,368 RETAIL OPERATIONS Store 705,779 554,899 RV Repair/Parts Store 600,228 495,488 Total 1,306,007 1,050,387 INTEREST INCOME 981 2,004 TOTAL REVENUE 9,811,887 7,432,759 
 Occupancy rates on the previous table are calculated based on the quantity occupied as compared to the total sites available for occupancy (i.e., total occupied to number of total available). Average paid site is based on site revenue and paid sites. Resort support operations include revenues received from the arcade, laundromat, recreational activities, and other less significant sources. 12 

2021 COMPARED WITH 2020 Resort operations income increased 2,124,531, or 33.3 , primarily due to COVID-19 and the resort campsites being closed from March 23, 2020 until May 22, 2020. Paid site revenue increased 1,951,626, or 43.7 , due to an increase of 26,372, or 38.2 in paid site night occupancy. Due to the temporary resort closure in 2020, RV Storage and RV Spotting revenue increased 111,526, or 6.5 , for fiscal year ended September 30, 2021. Retail operations income increased 255,620, or 24.3 , primarily due to the impact of COVID-19 on all resort retail segments during fiscal year 2020. While the RV Service operation was able to remain open, the General Store on the resort was closed from March 23, 2020 until June 5, 2020. The RV Service department revenue increased 104,740, or 21.1 above the previous year. The General Store revenue increased 150,879, or 27.2 above the previous year. In an effort to maximize revenue, management continues to stock more appropriate items, more effectively merchandise, and pay greater attention to customer service. In addition, management has actively promoted the RV service and retail operation locally compared to previous years. Interest/Dividend Income decreased 1,023, or 51.0 , below the previous year. Interest Expense decreased to 13,545 in 2021 compared to 17,413 the previous year. Operating Expenses increased 581,865, or 11.1 , as a result of labor, small equipment, credit card service expense, land lease, utilities including water/sewer, gas, electricity, and garbage, and vehicle expense. During the 2020 COVID-19 closure, 50 of the staff continued working. During this time many expenses were reduced or managed accordingly. Maintaining a conservative approach, most expense items were managed well below plan and in many categories below the previous year. The Board of Directors has directed management to continue maintenance projects as needed to provide a first-class resort for campers using recreational vehicles. Income before provision for income tax of 3,470,535, a 172.3 increase above last year, is reflective of increased income from operations. Net income of 2,413,335 for fiscal year 2021 shows an increase of 1,534,479, or 174.6 , above a net income of 878,856 in 2020. This increase in net income is a reflection of the increase in the income before provision for income tax. INFLATION has not had a significant impact on our profit position. The Company has increased rates, which have more than compensated for the rate of inflation. FUTURE OPERATING RESULTS could be unfavorably impacted to the extent that changing prices result in lower discretionary income for customers and/or increased transportation costs to the Resort. In addition, increasing prices affect operations and liquidity by raising the replacement cost of property and equipment. FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT FUTURE OPERATING RESULTS: A number of factors, many of which are common to the lodging industry and beyond our control, could affect our business, including the following: increased gas prices; increased competition from other resorts in our market; increases in operating costs due to inflation, labor costs, workers' compensation and healthcare related costs, utility costs, insurance and unanticipated costs such as acts of nature and their consequences and other factors that may not be offset by increased rates; changes in interest rates, cost and terms of debt financing; 13 

changes in governmental laws and regulations, fiscal policies and zoning ordinances and the related costs of compliance with laws and regulations, fiscal policies and ordinances; adverse effects of market conditions, which may diminish the desire for leisure travel; and adverse effects of a downturn in the leisure industry. The leisure and travel business is seasonal and seasonal variations in revenue at our Resort can be expected to cause quarterly fluctuations in our revenue. Our revenue is generally highest in the third and fourth quarters. Quarterly revenue also may be harmed by events beyond our control, such as extreme weather conditions, terrorist attacks or alerts, contagious diseases, economic factors, and other considerations affecting travel. To the extent that cash flow from operations is insufficient during any quarter due to temporary or seasonal fluctuations in revenue, we have to rely on our short-term line of credit for operations. In the recent past, events beyond our control, including an economic slowdown and terrorism, harmed the operating performance of the leisure industry generally, and if these or similar events occur again, our operating and financial results may be harmed by declines in average daily rates or occupancy. Carrying our outstanding debt may harm our business and financial results by: requiring us to use a substantial portion of our funds from operations to make required payments on principal and interest, which will reduce the amount of cash available to us for our operations and capital expenditures, future business opportunities and other purposes; making us more vulnerable to economic and industry downturns and reducing our flexibility in responding to changing business and economic conditions; limiting our ability to borrow more money for operations, capital expenditures or to finance acquisitions in the future; and requiring us to sell one or more properties, possibly on disadvantageous terms, in order to make required payments of interest and principal. Our Resort has a need for ongoing renovations and potentially significant capital expenditures in connection with improvements, and the costs of such renovations or improvements may exceed our expectations. Occupancy and the rates we are able to charge are often affected by the maintenance and capital improvements at a resort, especially in the event that the maintenance of improvements is not completed on schedule, or if the improvements result in the closure of the General Store or a significant number of sites. The costs of capital expenditures we need to make could harm our financial condition and reduce amounts available for operations. These capital improvements may also give rise to additional risks including: construction cost overruns and delays; a possible shortage of available cash to fund capital improvements and the related possibility that financing of these expenditures may not be available to us on favorable terms; uncertainties as to market demand or a loss of market demand after capital improvements have begun; 14 

disruption in service and site availability causing reduced demand, occupancy, and rates; and possible environmental issues. We rely on our executive officers, the loss of whom could significantly harm our business. Our continued success will depend, to a significant extent, on the efforts and abilities of our C.E.O. and General Manager, Jay Jamison. Mr. Jamison is important to our business and strategy and to the extent that were he to depart and is not replaced with an experienced substitute, Mr. Jamison's departure could harm our operations, financial condition and operating results. Uninsured and underinsured losses could harm our financial condition, and results of operations. Various types of catastrophic issues, such as losses due to wars, terrorist acts, earthquakes, floods, pollution or environmental matters, generally are either uninsurable or not economically insurable, or may be subject to insurance coverage limitations, such as large deductibles or co-payments. Our Resort is located on the coast of California, which has been historically at greater risk to certain acts of nature (such as severe storms, fires and earthquakes). In the event of a catastrophic loss, our insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover the full current market value or replacement cost of our lost properties. Should an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occur, we could lose all or a portion of the capital we have invested in the Resort, as well as the anticipated future revenue from the Resort. In that event, we might nevertheless remain obligated for any notes payable or other financial obligations related to the property. Inflation, changes in building codes and ordinances, environmental considerations and other factors might also keep us from using insurance proceeds to replace or renovate the Resort after it has been damaged or destroyed. Under these circumstances, the insurance proceeds we receive might be inadequate to restore our economic position on the damaged or destroyed property. ITEM 8.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and Shareholders Pismo Coast Village, Inc. 165 South Dolliver Street Pismo Beach, California Opinion on the Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Pismo Coast Village, Inc. (the Company) (a California corporation) as of September 30, 2021 and 2020, and the related statements of income and comprehensive income, stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of September 30, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended September 30, 2021, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit Matters The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. 16 

Income Taxes Management s estimates of the deferred tax assets, liabilities and provisions disclosed in Note 7 are based primarily on the differences between depreciation measurements on a tax basis versus GAAP basis, and timing of vacation expense recognition and shareholder site usage. We evaluated the key factors and assumptions used to develop the estimates of income tax provisions in determining that they are reasonable in relation to the financial statements taken as a whole. We identified the evaluation of the Company s income tax provisions as a critical audit matter because the application of tax law and timing of recognition of income tax expense and benefits is complex and involves subjective judgement. We have served as the Company s auditor since 2005. BROWN ARMSTRONG ACCOUNTANCY CORPORATION Bakersfield, California November 12, 2021 17

ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE There has been no change of accountants, nor any disagreement with accountants, on any matter of accounting principle, practices, or financial statement disclosures required to be reported under this item. ITEM 9A(T). CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Disclosure controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports, filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our management, under the direction of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer (who is our principal accounting officer), has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as required by Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(b) as of September 30, 2021 (the end of the period covered by this report). Based on that evaluation, our principal executive officer and our principal accounting officer concluded that these disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of such date. INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING Our management is also responsible for establishing internal control over financial reporting ("ICFR") as defined in Rules 13a-I5(f) and 15(d)-15(f) under the 1934 Act. Our ICFR is intended to be designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Our ICFR is expected to include policies and procedures that management believes are necessary that: 1. pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; 2. provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and our directors; and 3. provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Management recognizes that there are inherent limitations in the effectiveness of any system of internal control, and accordingly, even effective internal control can provide only reasonable assurance with respect of financial statement preparation and may not prevent or detect misstatements. In addition, effective internal control at a point in time may become ineffective in future periods because of changes in conditions or due to deterioration in the degree of compliance with our established policies and procedures. 33 

As of September 30, 2020, management assessed the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting (ICFR) based on the criteria for effective ICFR established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) and SEC guidance on conducting such assessments by smaller reporting companies and non-accelerated filers. Based on that assessment, management concluded that, during the period covered by this report, such internal controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2021. This Annual Report does not include an attestation report of our independent registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management's report was not subject to attestation by our independent registered public accounting firm pursuant to temporary rules of the SEC that permit us to provide only management's report in this Annual Report. There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

c. FAMILY RELATIONSHIPS There are no familial relationships between the Directors nor between the Directors and the Officers. d. INVOLVEMENT IN CERTAIN LEGAL PROCEEDINGS To the knowledge of the Company, none of the officers or directors have been personally involved in any bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings. To the knowledge of the Company, none of the directors or officers have been convicted in any criminal proceedings (excluding traffic violations and other minor offenses) or are the subject of a criminal proceeding which is presently pending, nor have such persons been the subject of any order, judgment, or decree of any court of competent jurisdiction, permanently or temporarily enjoining them from acting as an investment advisor, underwriter, broker or dealer in securities, or as an affiliated person, director or insurance company, or from engaging in or continuing in any conduct or practice in connection with any such activity or in connection with the purchase or sale of any security, nor were any of such persons the subject of a federal or state authority barring or suspending, for more than 60 days, the right of such person to be engaged in any such activity, which order has not been reversed or suspended. e. AUDIT COMMITTEE FINANCIAL EXPERT Our Board of Directors has determined that it does not have a member of its Audit Committee that qualifies as an "audit committee financial expert" as defined in Item 401(e) of Regulation S-B, and is "independent" as the term is used in Item 7(d)(3)(iv) of Schedule 14A under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. We believe that the members of our Audit Committee are collectively capable of analyzing and evaluating our financial statements and understanding internal controls and procedures for financial reporting. Due to the fact that the Directors of Pismo Coast Village, Inc. do not receive compensation for the services they provide in that capacity, the Company has been unable to nominate and retain a director with the required expertise to stand for election to the Board of Directors. However, until the time that our Audit Committee has a qualified audit committee financial expert, we believe our engagement of Glenn Burdette (GB), Certified Public Accountants, satisfies this requirement. GB provides the Company's quarterly compilation of the balance sheets and the related statements of income and retained earnings, and cash flows in accordance with Statements on Standards for Accounting and Review Services issued by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. f. CODE OF ETHICS On November 8, 2003, the Company's Board of Directors adopted the introduction to our code of ethical conduct. After further review, consideration was given to adopting a more comprehensive and detailed Code. At the meeting of the Executive Committee held June 19, 2009, the committee approved a recommendation to present a revised Code of Ethics to the full Board for adoption. At the Board of Directors meeting held July 18, 2009, the Board unanimously approved the revised and complete Code of Ethics that applies to all the Company's employees and directors, including our principal executive officer, principal financial officer, principal accounting officer or controller, and persons performing similar functions. The complete text of the revised Code of Ethics is filed with this Form 10-K as Exhibit 14. In addition, the Company has posted the Code of Ethics on its website, www.pismocoastvillage.com . 39 

A copy of the Company s Code of Ethics will be provided to any person, without charge, upon written request. Requests for the Company s Code of Ethics should be addressed to: Mr. Jay Jamison, Chief Executive Officer/General Manager Pismo Coast Village, Inc. 165 South Dolliver Street Pismo Beach CA 93449 g.

 EXHIBIT 99

Exhibit 99 Exhibit 99. Code of Ethics PISMO COAST VILLAGE, INC. (the "Company") CODE OF ETHICS AND BUSINESS CONDUCT FOR DIRECTORS, SENIOR OFFICERS AND EMPLOYEES OF THE COMPANY (the "Code") INTRODUCTION This Code applies to the Chief Executive Officer, President, Chief Financial Officer, Principal Executive Officer, Principal Financial Officer, Principal Accounting Officer, Controller and persons performing similar functions (collectively, the "Senior Officers") along with all directors and employees within the Company (the Senior Officers, directors and employees are hereinafter collectively referred to as the "Employees"). This Code covers a wide range of business practices and procedures. It does not cover every issue that may arise, but it sets out basic principles to guide all Employees of the Company. All Employees should conduct themselves accordingly and seek to avoid the appearance of improper behavior in any way relating to the Company. Any Employee who has any questions about the Code should consult with the Chief Executive Officer, the President, or the Company's audit committee (the "Audit Committee"). The Company has adopted the Code for the purposes of promoting: X honest and ethical conduct, including the ethical handling of actual or apparent conflicts of interest between personal and professional relationships; X full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in all reports and documents that the Company files with, or submits to, the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and in other public communications made by the Company that are within the Senior Officer's area of responsibility; X compliance with applicable governmental laws, rules and regulations; X the prompt internal reporting of violations of the Code; and X accountability for adherence to the Code. 1 
 
 HONEST AND ETHICAL CONDUCT Each Senior Officer and member of the Board owes a duty to the Company to act with integrity. Integrity requires, among other things, being honest and candid. Employees must adhere to a high standard of business ethics and are expected to make decisions and take actions based on the best interests of the Company, as a whole, and not based on personal relationships or benefits. Generally, a "conflict of interest" occurs when an Employee's personal interests is, or appears to be, inconsistent with, interferes with or is opposed to the best interests of the Company or gives the appearances of impropriety. Business decisions and actions must be made in the best interests of the Company and should not be influenced by personal considerations or relationships. Relationships with the Company's stakeholders for example suppliers, competitors and customers should not in any way affect an Employee's responsibility and accountability to the Company. Conflicts of interests can arise when an Employee or a member of his or her family receive improper gifts, entertainment or benefits as a result of his or her position in the Company. Specifically, each Employee must: 1. act with integrity, including being honest and candid while still maintaining the confidentiality of information when required or consistent with the Company's policies; 2. avoid violations of the Code, including actual or apparent conflicts of interest with the Company in personal and professional relationships; 3. disclose to the Chief Executive Officer, President, or the Audit Committee any material transaction or relationship that could reasonably be expected to give rise to a breach of the Code, including actual or apparent conflicts of interest with the Company; 4. obtain approval from the Chief Executive Officer, President or the Audit Committee before making any decisions or taking any action that could reasonably be expected to involve a conflict of interest or the appearance of a conflict of interest; 5. observe both the form and spirit of laws and governmental rules and regulations, accounting standards and Company policies; 6. maintain a high standard of accuracy and completeness in the Company's financial records; 7. ensure full, fair, timely, accurate and understandable disclosure in the Company's periodic reports; 8. report any violations of the Code to the Chief Executive Officer, President or Audit Committee; 2 
 
 9. proactively promote ethical behavior among peers in his or her work environment; and 10. maintain the skills appropriate and necessary for the performance of his or her duties. DISCLOSURE As a result of the Company's status as a public company, it is required to file periodic and other reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Company takes its public disclosure responsibility seriously to ensure that these reports furnish the marketplace with full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure regarding the financial and business condition of the Company. All disclosures contained in reports and documents filed with or submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission, or other government agencies, on behalf of the Company or contained in other public communications made by the Company must be complete and correct in all material respects and understandable to the intended recipient. The Senior Officers, in relation to his or her area of responsibility, must be committed to providing timely, consistent and accurate information, in compliance with all legal and regulatory requirements. It is imperative that this disclosure be accomplished consistently during both good times and bad and that all parties in the marketplace have equal or similar access to this information. All of the Company's books, records, accounts and financial statements must be maintained in reasonable detail, must appropriately reflect the Company's transactions, and must conform both to applicable legal requirements and to the Company's systems of internal controls. Unrecorded or "off the book" funds, assets or liabilities should not be maintained unless permitted by applicable law or regulation. Senior Officers involved in the preparation of the Company's financial statements must prepare those statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, consistently applied, and any other applicable accounting standards and rules so that the financial statements materially, fairly and completely reflect the business transactions and financial statements and related condition of the Company. Further, it is important that financial statements and related disclosures be free of material errors. Specifically, each Senior Officer must: 1. familiarize himself or herself with the disclosure requirements generally applicable to the Company; 2. not knowingly misrepresent, or cause others to misrepresent, facts about the Company to others, including the Company's independent auditors, governmental regulators, self-regulating organizations and other governmental officials: 3. to the extent that he or she participates in the creation of the Company's books and records, promote the accuracy, fairness and timeliness of those records; and 4. in relation to his or her area of responsibility, properly review and critically analyze proposed disclosure for accuracy and completeness. 3 
 
 CONFIDENTIALITY In carrying out the Company's business, directors, officers and employees often learn confidential or proprietary information about the Company, its customers, clients, suppliers, or joint venture parties. Directors, officers and employees must maintain the confidentiality of all information so entrusted to them, except when disclosure is authorized or legally mandated. Confidential or proprietary information of the Company, and of other companies, includes any nonpublic information that would be harmful to the relevant company or useful or helpful to competitors if disclosed. COMPLIANCE It is the Company's policy to comply with all applicable laws and governmental rules and regulations. It is the personal responsibility of each director, officer and employee to adhere to the standards and restrictions imposed by those laws, rules and regulations, including those relating to accounting and auditing matters. It is against Company policy and a violation of federal securities laws for a director, officer or employee to trade in securities on the basis of material information not yet publicly disclosed. Any director, officer or employee who possesses nonpublic information about the Company or its business which is material in nature may not trade in any securities affected by such nonpublic information, including the Company's securities, until such time as the information has been made known to the public. A material fact about a company is one that a reasonable investor would be likely to consider important in making a decision to buy, sell or hold the securities of such company. Any director, officer or employee who is uncertain about the legal rules involving a purchase or sale of any Company securities or any securities in companies that he or she is familiar with by virtue of his or her work for the Company, should consult the Audit Committee Chair. FAIR DEALING We have a history of succeeding through honest business competition. We do not seek competitive advantages through illegal or unethical business practices. Each director, officer and employee should endeavor to deal fairly with the Company's customers, clients, service providers, suppliers, competitors and employees. No director, officer or employee should take unfair advantage of anyone through manipulation, concealment, abuse of privileged information, misrepresentation of material facts, or any unfair dealing practice. REPORTING VIOLATIONS The Company, through the Board's Audit Committee, is responsible for applying this Code to specific situations in which questions may arise and has the authority to interpret this Code in any particular situation. This Code is not intended to provide a comprehensive guideline for Senior Officers in relation to their business activities with the Company. Any Employee may seek clarification on the application of this Code from the Audit Committee. 4 

Each Employee must: 1. notify the Company of any existing or potential violation of this Code, and failure to do so is itself a breach of the Code; and 2. not retaliate, directly or indirectly, or encourage others to do so, against any Employee for reports, made in good faith, or any misconduct or violations of the Code solely because that Employee raised a legitimate ethical issue. The Audit Committee will take all action it considers appropriate to investigate any breach of the Code reported to it. All Employees are required to cooperate fully with any such investigations and to provide truthful and accurate information. If the Audit Committee determines that a breach has occurred, it will take or authorize disciplinary or preventative action as it deems appropriate, after consultation with the Company's counsel if warranted, up to and including termination of employment. Where appropriate, the Company will not limit itself to disciplinary action but may pursue legal action against the offending Employee involved. In some cases, the Company may have a legal or ethical obligation to call violations to the attention of appropriate enforcement authorities. Compliance with the Code may be monitored by audits performed by the Audit Committee, the Company's counsel and/or by the Company's outside auditors. All Employees are required to cooperate fully with any such audits and to provide truthful and accurate information. Any waiver of this Code for any Employee may be made only by the Board or the Audit Committee and will be promptly disclosed to stockholders and others, as required by applicable law. The Company must disclose changes to and waivers of the Code in accordance with applicable law. 5
