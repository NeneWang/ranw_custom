 ITEM 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS. 
 
 THE COMPANY 
 
 (1) Form and year of organization 
 
 AS-IP Tech, Inc. (formerly ASI Entertainment, Inc.) was formed on April 29, 1998 as a Delaware corporation. The Company has an authorized capital of 500,000,000 shares of Common Stock, par value of 0.0001 per share (the Common Stock and 50,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value 0.0001 per share. All shares of Common Stock have equal voting rights, are non-assessable, and have one vote per share. The executive offices of the Company are located at 2/1 Contour Close, Research, Victoria, 3095 Australia. The United States offices of the Company are located at 954 Lexington Ave, Suite 242, New York, NY 10021. The Company s telephone number is +1 424-888-2212. 
 
 BUSINESS 
 
 (1) Principal products or services and their markets; 
 
 The Company s technology comprises two product lines called BizjetMobile and fflya. The products deliver inflight connectivity for business aviation and commercial airlines respectively. 
 
 BizjetMobile provides corporate jets with an alternative global inflight connectivity solution and is marketed under the brand names CrewX, CHiiMP and BizjetInternet. They are mobile Apps which deliver a combination of highly optimized inflight text, chat, email, voice and internet for passengers and crew. The on-board network comprises an integrated satellite transceiver incorporating a Bluetooth hotspot that uses a set of algorithms and file management protocols that are custom built for aviation satellite networks. All communications are managed by a cloud-based gateway and report by user, flight, aircraft, file, and message type. As a result, passengers and crew receive unlimited inflight connectivity for a flat low monthly rate. 
 
 fflya provides airlines with a customized global inflight connectivity approach, based on the latest mobile App technology, narrowband satellite links and Bluetooth technology. The fflya platform reduces the installation, certification and equipment costs by up to 90 compared to inflight broadband. In addition, it uses a cloud-based messaging platform capable of delivering real-time demographic and profiling data. By incorporating embedded advertising and destination sponsors, fflya can deliver free messaging to airline passengers. 
 1 
 
 BizjetMobile and fflya leverage off the existing Inmarsat Iridium satellites, but will be further enhanced by Next Generation Iridium satellites and Iridium Certus for aviation. 
 
 The Company has commissioned over 98 BizjetMobile systems since launch, operating across Asia Pacific, the America s, Europe and the Middle East. 
 
 Markets 
 
 BizjetMobile s target market is the business aviation industry, specifically international corporate jets searching for an alternative low-cost global inflight connectivity solution or an-add on service to reduce their operational costs. 
 
 fflya s target market is primarily low cost airlines LCA operating single aisle aircraft, for example, Boeing 737 and Airbus A320, that struggle to justify equipping their fleets with expensive Wi-Fi platforms as their business model targets passengers who are unwilling to pay. Of the 18,000 commercial airliners currently in operation, the B737/A320 series account for 13,000, of which approximately 75 are operated by regional airlines and LCA s. Single aisle aircraft represent 75 of the 35,000 new aircraft forecast to be delivered over the next 20 years. 
 
 (2) Distribution methods of the products or services; 
 
 The Company has BizjetMobile distributors which are related parties controlled by the Chapman family for the Americas, Europe and Asia Pacific, which market the products on a commission basis. fflya marketing is controlled by the Chapman family in conjunction with agents who will receive commissions from successful airline programs. The Company has also licensed PT. Jalin Angkasa Indonesia (JAI) as the exclusive marketing arm for Indonesia and Malaysia. 
 
 (3) Status of any publicly announced new product or service; 
 
 fflya - Following the official launch of the fflya airline program in 2018 at the World Aviation festival in London, the Company embarked on an extensive marketing campaign to secure a launch customer. Leading up to the launch, the program had completed ground and flight testing of the Bluetooth network with a major European Airline on an A380 and B777. Further internal testing was also conducted on B787 and A340. 
 
 Following a further 18 months of airline discussion and presentations, the fflya program evolved to its current format. As a direct result, ASIP announced agreements with Wizz Air and Citilink to trial the fflya system. 
 
 The fflya hardware, apps, gateway and support system are developed and supplied by a related party, ASiQ Pty Ltd (ASiQ), under the IP acquisition agreement and comprises, a router that connects passengers via Bluetooth, and a revolutionary window antenna system that connects to the Iridium satellite network. ASIP contracts the service and hardware under commercial terms on a program-by-program basis. 
 
 The systems proprietary software app facilitates free passenger messaging, profiled and embedded with sponsors and links. It can be embedded into an airline s existing booking App, which can create an instant database of millions of potential users when the airline app is updated, in addition to the ability to brand each service or icon. Every text message can include an embedded sponsor i.e. delivered by XXXX or branded by sponsor or airline, and every free email can incorporate sponsored promotions i.e. logos or links promoting the airline s service or sponsors. In addition to messaging, fflya provides 45,000 tours and attractions via a partnership with Viator (a Trip Advisor company) programmed to the passenger destination by flight. 
 
 The complete fflya hardware solution is lightweight and low-cost as it doesn t require expensive broadband satellite connections. As a result, minimal revenue is required to fund the entire installation. By providing the system on a revenue sharing basis, ASIP gains exclusive access to one of the most highly desirable markets. A captive, cashed up, leisure traveller. 
 2 
 
 CrewX (Crew Exchange) - is an entry level ultra-low cost core communications platform for business jets and the simplest way to keep crew connected. For airlines, CrewX is a Bluetooth communications framework that can be easily embedded into any existing crew App or operate as a stand-alone App and provides a virtual private secure network for crew to enhance efficiency of crew communications on-board the aircraft, without needing to install certified aircraft servers, Wi-Fi networks or perform modifications to the aircraft systems. 
 
 (4) Competitive business conditions and the small business issuer s competitive position in the industry and methods of competition; 
 
 Competition 
 
 Business Jet 
 
 BizjetMobile is focused on the global market because of its use of satellite communications. In the USA, the business jet market is dominated GOGO Inc. (formally Aircell). GOGO s system connects passenger devices via Wi-Fi, having implemented an exclusive terrestrial wireless radio network across the domestic United States for transmission off the aircraft. GOGO has approximately 5,000+ domestic business jets connected to its system. 
 
 Internationally GOGO has equipped a further 4,737 aircraft with the Aircell (division of GOGO) Iridium satellite telephone systems. These are legacy satellite systems that cannot deliver Internet. ASIP s ChiiMP system enhances the Iridium telephone with messaging services and several BizjetMobile customers are connected via the Aircell Iridium systems. GOGO is also an INMARSAT reseller and has equipped several international aircraft with Wi-Fi. These systems are mainly installed at factory on larger jets and range in price from 150 - 650K. A second company VIASAT, also competes for the large jets with a similar 650K international solution. 
 
 Other non US business jet competition. 
 
 While there are multiple Iridium Telephone System resellers globally and some with basic Iridium messaging capability, none can match the capabilities of the BizjetMobile product range as BizjetMobile is the leader in inflight Bluetooth connectivity. 
 
 Airlines 
 
 In the airline market, fflya will compete against major Wi-Fi inflight industry players, Panasonic, Intelsat (which recently acquired GOGO s airline business), GEE, Thales, VIASAT and INMARSAT. 
 
 Panasonic, GEE and Thales are resellers of satellite services, whereas VIASAT, Intelsat and INMARSAT are satellite owner-operators. The primary market for all these vendors is predominantly Tier 1 airlines and national flag carriers. These airlines provide business travellers with an adequate level of internet connectivity at a cost per flight similar to the daily rate of many 5-star hotels. In some cases, first and business class passengers receive this service free of charge. 
 
 Equipment, installation and certification costs on Wi-Fi platforms are substantial and where possible, most airlines will exercise the option to have it factory installed on new aircraft. Approximately 25 of the world s airlines are currently equipped with inflight Wi-Fi, the majority of which are either in the U.S.A or are long haul wide body Boeing and Airbus aircraft. Recent forecasts suggest that half of the world s airlines will be fully equipped by 2025. 
 
 The challenge for the Company to compete, is to target the remaining market and create a platform and business model that eliminates the financial risk, generates new revenue, enhances the passenger experience, and removes the high operational/user costs associated with heavy and expensive Wi-Fi platforms. 
 
 The Company meets these challenges by targeting only the LCA market with a platform that is 95 lighter and cheaper and controlled by a proprietary gateway protocol that is up to 90 more efficient in delivering today s mobile App-based communications. This creates the ability to deliver a sponsored free texting 
 3 
 
 service and generate new revenue from multiple inflight e-commerce opportunities. AS-IP s unique program targets LCA s which represent approximately 50 of the airline world, flying mainly Boeing B737 and Airbus A320 series aircraft and carry around 2 billion disconnected leisure passengers. 
 
 To deliver Wi-Fi into aircraft, all existing aviation internet providers rely on Geostationary Satellites (GEO s). GEO s orbit 36,000 kilometres above the equator. This creates signal latency up to 10 times greater than a mobile phone network. As a result, internet speed by comparison to what s on the ground is very slow, usually between 12-15 Mbps per aircraft, which is why there are constant complaints about the level of service. As on average, only 6 of passengers will pay for inflight Wi-Fi, major airlines are prepared to offer this limited capability to satisfy their frequent and business flyers. In the majority of cases, the installation and equipment is funded by the Wi-Fi service provider, so the airlines financial risk is mitigated. 
 
 Industry insiders are suggesting that having 5 companies fighting over the same major airline segment may no longer be viable. Particularly when you consider that prior to its sale after 10 years of operation, the GOGO airline business, had yet to make a profit. 
 
 With the recent impact of Covid19 grounding global fleets, revenue sources for Wi-Fi providers from paying passengers has been dramatically reduced as their business models predominantly rely on business travellers. Most industry sources suggest this will be slowest area to recover, versus the leisure traveller who has been bottled up for a year. 
 
 fflya s Bluetooth technology leverages off Low Earth Orbit satellites (LEO s). As LEO s operate 800 kilometres above the earth, latency is similar to a mobile phone network. While todays Iridium Next LEOs offer far less bandwidth than GEO s, their low cost and low latency are perfectly suited to connect fflya s Bluetooth app-based technology. 
 
 fflya is future proofed as it does not rely on the high cost of broadband or Wi-Fi to deliver its services. There are 3 key components that suit LCA s: Text, Telemetry and Credit Card Payment. All are delivered via short burst data which specifically suits the fflya Bluetooth and Iridium data platforms. 
 
 Future LEO networks such as OneWeb and Elon Musk s Starlink while promoting faster speeds and lower latency, still rely on broadband. Both operate in the same frequency spectrum as the existing inflight Wi-Fi providers. The governing factor in those frequencies are the enormously expensive and large antenna 250K). 
 
 Tier 1 airlines which already have the antennas installed, may see this an option if the price, service and profit potential dictates. However, offering inflight internet, and actually delivering it profitably, is another story. As far as the industry is concerned, the jury is still out. 
 
 The Company believes it will be able to compete with other companies in both the business aircraft and commercial airline fields because of our very low equipment costs, unique business model and little or no certification issues. 
 
 (5) Sources and availability of raw materials and the names of principal suppliers; amortization, engineering, marketing and communication costs 
 
 The principal supplier of systems and services to the company is ASiQ, controlled by Ron Chapman, the President of the Company. As part of the original IP acquisition agreement, the Company was required to secure the service of Ron Chapman. It is Ron and ASIQ s reputation in the aviation industry, that provides the credibility, drives the direction, and creates the programs for the Company. The Chapman family controls all marketing on behalf of the Company. 
 
 (6) Dependence on one or a few major customers. 
 
 The Company will be dependent on its distribution network to market the product to generate income from hardware sales and service fees and its airline marketing partners to secure airline programs. The timing and extent of that marketing will be dependent on the resources and efforts of the Company, its distributors, and partners. 
 4 

(7) Patents, trademarks, licenses, franchises, concessions, royalty agreements or labor contracts, including duration; 
 
 The Company originally acquired the application for an Australian patent and received notification that the International Preliminary Report on Patentability had been established. The Company filed national phase patent applications in Australia, the United States, China and European Union. In January 2010, the Company received the Australian patent. In January 2012, the Company received the Chinese patent. With the advent of Bluetooth Smart, the technology and the Company s IP has advanced to a point where the patent was no longer relevant. The Company subsequently decided to proceed no further with the patents, as the technology is predominately software based and protected by copyright. 
 
 (8) Need for any government approval of principal products or services. If government approval is necessary and the small business issuer has not yet received that approval, discuss the status of the approval within the government approval process. 
 
 Installation and use of aircraft avionics in aircraft requires prior certification and approval by the Federal Aviation Administration FAA and equivalent regulatory authorities of foreign governments on each aircraft type and for each airline, although FAA approval is generally globally acceptable. 
 
 Normally the certification process begins with the installation of the system on an aircraft after which it is certified by an accredited engineer and organisation. The certification is then applicable to similar aircraft types and modified for other aircraft type. In countries other than the United States, the equivalent aviation authority procedures will apply to the certification of the system, but the United States FAA is generally accepted by local certifying authorities throughout the world. Prior to certification and approval, the manufacturer demonstrate that the system has been designed and manufactured and complies with the appropriate aviation standards. Historically, ASiQ has followed the certification path of DO-160 for hardware and DO-178 for software. Following this step, the system must be installed on an aircraft and tested, including a ground and flight test. 
 
 Due to Covid over the past 12-month period, the Company s industrial partner ASiQ, was forced to take an alternative approach. As our launch customer Wizz Air s head office was in Hungary, we selected one of their UK registered aircraft for the flight trial. This enabled ASiQ to engage EU/UK aviation certified companies to produce the engineering/certification package and manufacture the certified installation kit. 
 
 ASiQ originally designed the business aircraft system to be is installed as a Portable Electronic Device PED and as such, little or no certification is required. The Company could now embark on the same process for airlines, which will ultimately lead to a lower cost certifiable platform. 
 
 As the App is installed on a mobile phone or tablet, which are regarded as carry on devices and operated in flight or offline mode, no aircraft certification is required however, in the majority of cases the final approval for use in flight will be at the discretion of the aircraft operator. 
 
 As a result, following successful operational approval of fflya onboard the Wizz Air Airbus A321 test aircraft, the Company recently commenced airline testing using cabin crew. Passenger trials are expected to follow in early October. 
 
 Finally, both programs Android and IOS Apps are based on a Bluetooth network and Bluetooth has been tested and documented as safe for use in aircraft, which simplifies the operator acceptance process. 
 
 (9) Effect of existing or probable governmental regulations on the business; 
 
 The company must maintain good standing, comply with applicable local business licensing requirements, prepare and file periodic reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and comply with other applicable securities laws, rules and regulations. 
 
 Existing or probable governmental regulations have not impacted our operations except for the increased costs of compliance with reporting obligations. These additional costs remain consistent as long as the company continues as a reporting corporation. 
 5 

(10) Estimate of the amount spent during each of the last two fiscal years on research and development activities, and if applicable the extent to which the cost of such activities is borne directly by customers; 
 
 The Company estimates over the last 2 years, it has expended in excess of 500,000 on research and development, none of which has been borne by the customers.

 ITEM 6. SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA. 
 
 Not required for a smaller reporting company. 
 
 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OR PLAN OF OPERATION. 
 
 OVERVIEW 
 
 The Company maintains a low-cost structure as it has no employees, contracting the services of executives and support as required. Because of the low-cost structure, the Company anticipates that the proceeds from stock issues and revenue from service and system sales, will be sufficient to meet the Company s operating and capital requirements for approximately 12 months. 
 
 RESULTS AND PLAN OF OPERATIONS 
 
 The Company had accumulated losses from inception to June 30, 2021 of 14,195,118. Major components of the loss include capital raising costs, consulting and management fees, engineering fees and operations costs. The Company may be required to make significant additional expenditures in connection with the development of the BizjetMobile and fflya programs. The Company s ability to continue its operations is dependent upon its receiving funds through its anticipated sources of financing including capital raisings, borrowings and revenues from operations. 
 
 YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2021 COMPARED WITH YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2020 
 
 In the 2021 financial year, the Company s programs were severely impacted by the Covid19 pandemic with virtually every business jet customer program grounded. To ensure the ongoing viability of the Company and to continue the refinement and implementation of the fflya airline program, all payments to executives and associated engineering and support services were reduced by 50 , on the basis that they would be back 
 7 
 
 to normal by May 2021. While Covid19 has still had an operational impact, business jet system sales have recovered, although the service revenue remains sluggish. On the airline front, the first airlines installation was completed on Wizz Air in February 2021. 
 
 The Company received revenue of 73,837 from its BizjetMobile business in the year ended June 30, 2021, compared to 36,205 in the year ended June 30, 2020. Revenue from BizjetMobile service fees decreased from 19,387 to 11,964 and BizjetMobile system sales increased from 16,818 to 61,873 in the years ended June 30, 2020 and June 30, 2021 respectively. The Company has been able to achieve increased system sales with the introduction of an ultra low cost system in Q3 2020.

 OUTLOOK 
 
 The following are forward looking statements and should be read in conjunction with the Forward Looking Statement in Part I. of this Form 10-K. 
 
 The Company s current revenue was from service fees and system sales generated by BizjetMobile. Revenue was based on hardware sales of the Bluetooth systems, plus on-going revenue from monthly 
 8 
 
 service charges for the provision of connectivity. The Company then contracted ASiQ to supply and support the Bizjet program. Covid damaged the Bizjet market grounding all aircraft, and the impact on ASiQ, the Company s industrial partner was severe. 
 
 In order to retain the services of Ron Chapman and ASiQ and continue to support the Companies fflya program. Effective October 1st, 2021, the company s revenue on BizjetMobile will be in the form of commissions only from ASiQ, on a case-by-case basis. This informal arrangement will be reviewed in December 2021 when ASiQ s position and Covid is much clearer. 
 
 ASiQ provides the airline facilities, systems and support services funded as required on a nominal month by month basis by the Company. 
 
 The Company s primary focus over the past 12 months has been development of fflya to support its Wizz Air program. 
 
 The company s fflya business model is based on offering free messaging to be paid for by general and destination specific advertising. In the post Covid environment, in which airlines are relying more on their Apps for boarding passes and other flight information, passengers on customer airlines will be able to access the fflya system for messaging as well as bookings for tours and attractions. Under the fflya program, an airline will receive the system on a revenue share basis on terms to be agreed. As the equipment cost is a fraction of a Wi-Fi platform, the Company needs minimal commissions to justify the cost of the hardware. The Company believes LCA s will be attracted to this business model. 
 
 REVENUE RECOGNITION 
 
 The Company recognizes revenue from the sales of goods and services under ASC 606 by applying the following steps: (1) identify the contract with a customer; (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determine the transaction price; (4) allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation in the contract; and (5) recognize revenue when each performance obligation is satisfied. .Revenue is recognised on the basis of net proceeds received from the Company s representatives, after commissions are deducted. 
 
 GOING CONCERN 
 
 The financial statements appearing elsewhere in this report have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As such, they do not include adjustments relating to the recoverability of recorded asset amounts and classification of recorded assets and liabilities. The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. The Company has suffered recurring losses from operations that raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management s plans in regard to these matters are described in Note 1 to the financial statements. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 
 
 The Company s ability to continue its operations is dependent upon its raising of capital through debt or equity financing in order to meet its working needs. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern, and if substantial additional funding is not acquired or alternative sources developed, management will be required to curtail its operations. 
 
 The Company may raise additional capital by the sale of its equity securities, through an offering of debt securities, or from borrowing from a financial institution. The Company does not have a policy on the amount of borrowing or debt that the Company can incur. Management believes that actions presently being taken to obtain additional funding provide the opportunity for the Company to continue as a going concern.

 Going concern uncertainty 
 
 The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, the Company has suffered recurring losses from operations and has an accumulated deficit that raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management s plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 1. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 
 
 Basis for Opinion 
 
 These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 
 
 Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 
 Emphasis of a Matter

 Auditing the accounting treatment for modification or extinguishment of debts involved complex evaluation to the change in fair value of the modification, to the accounting for gain or loss to the extinguishment, and to any additional beneficial conversion feature for the convertible notes to be recognized.

 NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

Going Concern 
 
 The accompanying financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. As shown in the accompanying financial statements, the Company has recurring operating losses, limited funds and has accumulated deficits. These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt that the Company will be unable to continue as a going concern. 
 
 The Company may raise additional capital through the sale of its equity securities, through an offering of debt securities, or through borrowings from financial institutions. The Company expects to generate revenue in the future from the BizjetMobile and fflya businesses from the sale of hardware and provision of on-going services. Management believes that actions presently being taken to obtain additional funding provide the opportunity for the Company to continue as a going concern. 
 
 The financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of assets and/or liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. The continuation as a going concern is dependent upon the ability of the Company to meet our obligations on a timely basis, and, ultimately to attain profitability.

 The Company s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a- 15(f) and 15d-15(f) under Exchange Act). The Company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial policies and procedures that: 
 
 pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; 
 
 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of our Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and 
 
 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 11 

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, the Company assessed the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2021. In making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO 2013). Based on the results of this assessment and on those criteria the Company concluded that the internal controls over financial reporting as of June 30, 2021 were not effective. 
 
 This annual report does not include any attestation report of the company s registered public accounting firm regarding internal controls over financial reporting. Management s report was not subject to attestation by the Company s registered public accounting firm pursuant to temporary rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission that permit the Company to provide only management s report in this annual report.
