statements give the Company s current expectations, plans, objectives, assumptions or forecasts of future events. All statements
other than statements of current or historical fact contained in this annual report, including statements regarding the Company s
future financial position, business strategy, budgets, projected costs and plans and objectives of management for future operations,
are forward-looking statements. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as anticipate, 
 estimate, plans, potential, projects, ongoing, expects, 
 management believes, we believe, we intend, and similar expressions. These statements are based
on the Company s current plans and are subject to risks and uncertainties, and as such the Company s actual future activities
and results of operations may be materially different from those set forth in the forward looking statements. Any or all of the forward-looking
statements in this annual report may turn out to be inaccurate and as such, you should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking
statements. The Company has based these forward-looking statements largely on its current expectations and projections about future
events and financial trends that it believes may affect its financial condition, results of operations, business strategy and financial
needs. The forward-looking statements can be affected by inaccurate assumptions or by known or unknown risks, uncertainties and assumptions
due to a number of factors, including:

 PART
I 

 Item
1. Business 

 We
were incorporated April 24, 2012 under the laws of the State of Nevada. We intend to engage primarily in the development of regenerative
medical applications which we intend to license, develop internally or acquire outright from other entities up to the point of successful
completion of Phase I and or Phase II clinical trials after which we would either attempt to sell or license those developed applications
or, alternatively, advance the application further to Phase III clinical trials. The primary factor to be considered by us in arriving
at a decision to advance an application further to Phase III clinical trials would be a greater than anticipated indication of efficacy
seen in Phase I trials. 

 As
of July 29, 2021 we have not licensed any existing therapies which may be marketed. On June 23, 2015 Regen Biopharma, Inc. Regen entered into an agreement Agreement with Zander Therapeutics, Inc. Zander whereby Regen granted to Zander
an exclusive worldwide right and license for the development and commercialization of certain intellectual property controlled by Regen License IP for non-human veterinary therapeutic use for a term of fifteen years. Zander is under common control with
the Company.

Pursuant
to the Agreement, Zander shall pay to Regen one-time, non-refundable, upfront payment of one hundred thousand US dollars 100,000) as
a license initiation fee which must be paid within 90 days of June 23, 2015 and an annual non-refundable payment of one hundred thousand
US dollars 100,000) on July 15th, 2016 and each subsequent anniversary of the effective date of the Agreement. 

 he
abovementioned payments may be made, at Zander s discretion, in cash or newly issued common stock of Zander or in common stock
of Entest BioMedical Inc. valued as of the lowest closing price on the principal exchange upon which said common stock trades publicly
within the 14 trading days prior to issuance. 

 Pursuant
to the Agreement, Zander shall pay to Regen royalties equal to four percent (4 of the Net Sales , as such term is defined in the Agreement,
of any Licensed Products, as such term is defined in the Agreement, in a Quarter. 

 Pursuant
to the Agreement, Zander will pay Regen ten percent (10 of all consideration (in the case of in-kind consideration, at fair market
value as monetary consideration) received by Zander from sublicensees excluding royalties from sublicensees based on Net Sales of any
Licensed Products for which Regen receives payment pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Agreement). 

 Zander
is obligated pay to Regen minimum annual royalties of ten thousand US dollars 10,000) payable per year on each anniversary of the Effective
Date of this Agreement, commencing on the second anniversary of June 23, 2015. This minimum annual royalty is only payable to the extent
that royalty payments made during the preceding 12-month period do not exceed ten thousand US dollars 10,000). 

 The
Agreement may be terminated by Regen: 

 If
Zander has not sold any Licensed Product by ten years of the effective date of the Agreement or Zander has not sold any Licensed Product
for any twelve (12) month period after Zander s first commercial sale of a Licensed Product.

Need
for any government approval of principal products or services, effect of existing or probable governmental regulations on the business. 

 The
US Food and Drug Administration FDA and foreign regulatory authorities will regulate our proposed products as drugs or
biologics, , depending upon such factors as the use to which the product will be put, the chemical composition, and the interaction of
the product on the human body. In the United States, products that are intended to be introduced into the body will generally be regulated
as drugs, while tissues and cells intended for transplant into the human body will be generally be regulated as biologics. 

 Our
domestic human drug and biological products will be subject to rigorous FDA review and approval procedures. After testing in animals,
an Investigational New Drug Application IND must be filed with the FDA to obtain authorization for human testing. Extensive
clinical testing, which is generally done in three phases, must then be undertaken at a hospital or medical center to demonstrate optimal
use, safety, and efficacy of each product in humans. 

 Phase
I 

 Phase
1 trials are designed to assess the safety (pharmacovigilance), tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of a drug. These
trials are often conducted in an inpatient clinic, where the subject can be observed by full-time staff. The subject who receives the
drug is usually observed until several half-lives of the drug have passed. Phase I trials normally include dose-ranging, also called
dose escalation, studies so that the appropriate dose for therapeutic use can be found. The tested range of doses usually are a fraction
of the dose that causes harm in animal testing and involve a small group of healthy volunteers. However, there are some circumstances
when real patients are used, such as patients who have end-stage disease and lack other treatment options. 

7 

Phase
II 

 Phase
II trials are designed to assess how well the drug or biologic works, as well as to continue Phase I safety assessments in a larger group
of volunteers and patients. Phase II trials are performed on larger groups. 

 Phase
III 

 Phase
III trials are aimed at being the definitive assessment of how effective the product is in comparison with current best standard treatment
and to provide an adequate basis for physician labeling. Phase III trials may also be conducted for the purposes of (i) label expansion 
(to show the product works for additional types of patients/diseases beyond the original use for which the drug was approved for marketing
or (ii) to obtain additional safety data, or to support marketing claims for the product. 

 On
occasion Phase IV (Post Approval) trials may be required by the FDA. Phase IV trials involve the safety surveillance (pharmacovigilance)
and ongoing technical support of a drug after it receives permission to be sold.The safety surveillance is designed to detect any rare
or long-term adverse effects over a much larger patient population and longer time period than was possible during the Phase I-III clinical
trials. 

 All
phases, must be undertaken at a hospital or medical center to demonstrate optimal use, safety, and efficacy of each product in humans.
Each clinical study is conducted under the auspices of an independent Institutional Review Board IRB ). The IRB will consider,
among other things, ethical factors, the safety of human subjects, and the possible liability of the institution. The time and expense
required to perform this clinical testing can far exceed the time and expense of the research and development initially required to create
the product. No action can be taken to market any therapeutic product in the United States until an appropriate New Drug Application NDA or Biologic License Application BLA or has been approved by the FDA. FDA regulations also restrict
the export of therapeutic products for clinical use prior to NDA or BLA approval. 

 Even
after initial FDA approval has been obtained, further studies may be required to provide additional data on safety or to gain approval
for the use of a product as a treatment for clinical indications other than those initially targeted. In addition, use of these products
during testing and after marketing could reveal side effects that could delay, impede, or prevent FDA marketing approval, resulting in
FDA-ordered product recall, or in FDA-imposed limitations on permissible 

 The
FDA regulates the manufacturing process of pharmaceutical products, and human tissue and cell products, requiring that they be produced
in compliance with Current Good Manufacturing Practices cGMP . The FDA also regulates the content of advertisements used
to market pharmaceutical products. Generally, claims made in advertisements concerning the safety and efficacy of a product, or any advantages
of a product over another product, must be supported by clinical data filed as part of an NDA or an amendment to an NDA, and statements
regarding the use of a product must be consistent with the FDA approved labeling and dosage information for that product. 

 Sales
of drugs and biologics outside the United States are subject to foreign regulatory requirements that vary widely from country to country.
Even if FDA approval has been obtained, approval of a product by comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries must be obtained
prior to the commencement of marketing the product in those countries. The time required to obtain such approval may be longer or shorter
than that required for FDA approval

 PART

 Item
5. Market for Registrant s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities 

 The
Company s common stock is a penny stock, as defined in Rule 3a51-1 under the Exchange Act. The penny stock rules
require a broker-dealer, prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from the rules, to deliver a standardized risk
disclosure document that provides information about penny stocks and the nature and level of risks in the penny stock market. The broker-dealer
also must provide the customer with current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock, the compensation of the broker-dealer and its
sales person in the transaction, and monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer's account.
In addition, the penny stock rules require that the broker-dealer, not otherwise exempt from such rules, must make a special written
determination that the penny stock is suitable for the purchaser and receive the purchaser's written agreement to the transaction. These
disclosure rules have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity in the secondary market for a stock that becomes subject to
the penny stock rules. So long as the common stock of the Company is subject to the penny stock rules, it may be more difficult to sell
common stock of the Company.

Item
8. Financial Statements 

Report
of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 

 To the shareholders
and the board of directors of Regen Biopharma, Inc. 

 Opinion
on the Financial Statements 

 We have
audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Regen Biopharma, Inc. as of September 30, 2021 and 2020, the related statements
of operations, stockholders' equity (deficit), and cash flows for the years then ended, and the related notes (collectively referred
to as the financial statements ). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of the Company as of September 30, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended,
in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. 

 Substantial
Doubt about the Company s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern 

 The accompanying
financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 3 to the financial
statements, the Company has suffered recurring losses from operations and has a significant accumulated deficit. In addition, the Company
continues to experience negative cash flows from operations. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue
as a going concern. Management's plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 3. The financial statements do not include
any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

 Basis
for Opinion 

 These financial
statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial
statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United
States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities
laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

 We conducted
our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not
required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we
are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion
on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

 Our audit
included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud,
and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts
and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audit provides a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In
August 2014, FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2014-15 Preparation of Financial Statements Going Concern (Subtopic
205-40), Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern. Under generally accepted accounting
principles (GAAP), continuation of a reporting entity as a going concern is presumed as the basis for preparing financial statements
unless and until the entity s liquidation becomes imminent. Preparation of financial statements under this presumption is commonly
referred to as the going concern basis of accounting. If and when an entity s liquidation becomes imminent, financial statements
should be prepared under the liquidation basis of accounting in accordance with Subtopic 205-30, Presentation of Financial Statements Liquidation
Basis of Accounting. Even when an entity s liquidation is not imminent, there may be conditions or events that raise substantial
doubt about the entity s ability to continue as a going concern. In those situations, financial statements should continue to be
prepared under the going concern basis of accounting, but the amendments in this Update should be followed to determine whether to disclose
information about the relevant conditions and events. The amendments in this Update are effective for the annual period ending after
December 15, 2016, and for annual periods and interim periods thereafter. Early application is permitted. The Company will evaluate the
going concern considerations in this ASU, however, at the current period, management does not believe that it has met the conditions
which would subject these financial statements for additional disclosure. 

 On
January 31, 2013, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update [ASU] 2013-01, entitled Clarifying the Scope of Disclosures about Offsetting
Assets and Liabilities. The guidance in ASU 2013-01 amends the requirements in the FASB Accounting Standards Codification [FASB ASC]
Topic 210, entitled Balance Sheet. The ASU 2013-01 amendments to FASB ASC 210 clarify that ordinary trade receivables and receivables
in general are not within the scope of ASU 2011-11, entitled Disclosure about Offsetting Assets and Liabilities, where that ASU amended
the guidance in FASB ASC 210. As those disclosures now are modified with the ASU 2013-01 amendments, the FASB ASC 210 balance sheet offsetting
disclosures now clearly are applicable only where reporting entities are involved with bifurcated embedded derivatives, repurchase agreements,
reverse repurchase agreements, and securities borrowing and lending transactions that either are offset using the FASB ASC 210 or 815
requirements, or that are subject to enforceable master netting arrangements or similar agreements. ASU 2013-01 is effective for annual
reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2013, and interim periods within those annual periods. The adoption of this ASU is
not expected to have a material impact on our financial statements. 

 On
February 28, 2013, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update [ASU] 2013-04, entitled Obligations Resulting from Joint and Several Liability
Arrangements for Which the Total Amount of the Obligation Is Fixed at the Reporting Date. The ASU 2013-04 amendments add to the guidance
in FASB Accounting Standards Codification [FASB ASC] Topic 405, entitled Liabilities and require reporting entities to measure obligations
resulting from certain joint and several liability arrangements where the total amount of the obligation is fixed as of the reporting
date, as the sum of the following: 

 The
amount the reporting entity agreed to pay on the basis of its arrangement among co-obligors. 

 Any
additional amounts the reporting entity expects to pay on behalf of its co-obligors. 

 While
early adoption of the amended guidance is permitted, for public companies, the guidance is required to be implemented in fiscal years,
and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2013. The amendments need to be implemented retrospectively to all
prior periods presented for obligations resulting from joint and several liability arrangements that exist at the beginning of the year
of adoption. The adoption of ASU 2013-04 is not expected to have a material effect on the Company s operating results or financial
position. 

On
April 22, 2013, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update [ASU] 2013-07, entitled Liquidation Basis of Accounting. With ASU 2013-07,
the FASB amends the guidance in the FASB Accounting Standards Codification [FASB ASC] Topic 205, entitled Presentation of Financial Statements.
The amendments serve to clarify when and how reporting entities should apply the liquidation basis of accounting. The guidance is applicable
to all reporting entities, whether they are public or private companies or not-for-profit entities. The guidance also provides principles
for the recognition of assets and liabilities and disclosures, as well as related financial statement presentation requirements. The
requirements in ASU 2013-07 are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2013, and interim reporting periods
within those annual periods. Reporting entities are required to apply the requirements in ASU 2013-07 prospectively from the day that
liquidation becomes imminent. Early adoption is permitted. The adoption of ASU 2013-07 is not expected to have a material effect on the
Company s operating results or financial position. 

 In
January 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-01, which amends
the guidance in U.S. GAAP on the classification and measurement of financial instruments. Changes to the current guidance primarily affect
the accounting for equity investments, financial liabilities under the fair value option, and the presentation and disclosure requirements
for financial instruments. In addition, the ASU clarifies guidance related to the valuation allowance assessment when recognizing deferred
tax assets resulting from unrealized losses on available-for-sale debt securities. The new standard is effective for fiscal years and
interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and upon adoption, an entity should apply the amendments by means of a cumulative-effect
adjustment to the balance sheet at the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance is effective. Early adoption is
not permitted except for the provision to record fair value changes for financial liabilities under the fair value option resulting from
instrument-specific credit risk in other comprehensive income. The Company adopted ASU 2016-01 as of the fiscal year ending September
30, 2019. 

 A
variety of proposed or otherwise potential accounting standards are currently under study by standard setting organizations and various
regulatory agencies. Due to the tentative and preliminary nature of those proposed standards, the Company s management has
not determined whether implementation of such standards would be material to its financial statements. 

 during the period from April 24, 2012 (inception) through September 30, 2021. This condition raises substantial
doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The Company s continuation as a going concern is dependent
on its ability to meet its obligations, to obtain additional financing as may be required and ultimately to attain profitability. The
financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

 Management
plans to raise additional funds by offering securities for cash. Management has yet to decide what type of offering the Company will
use or how much capital the Company will raise.

As
of September 30 2021 the Company has a Deferred Tax Asset of completely attributable to net operating loss carry forwards
of approximately . The amount and availability of any net operating loss carryforward will be subject to the limitations
set forth in the Internal Revenue Code. Such factors as the number of shares ultimately issued within a three-year look-back period;
whether there is a deemed more than 50 change in control; the applicable long-term tax exempt bond rate; continuity of historical business;
and subsequent income of the Company all enter into the annual computation of allowable annual utilization of any net operating loss
carryforward. 

 Realization
of deferred tax assets is dependent upon sufficient future taxable income during the period that deductible temporary differences and
carry forwards are expected to be available to reduce taxable income. The achievement of required future taxable income is uncertain. 

 A
corporation is considered to undergo an ownership change if, as a result of changes in the stock ownership by 5-percent
shareholders or as a result of certain reorganizations, the percentage of the corporation s stock owned by those 5-percent
shareholders increases by more than 50 percentage points over the lowest percentage of stock owned by those shareholders at any time
during the prior three-year testing period. Five-percent shareholders are persons who hold 5 or more of the stock of a corporation at
any time during the testing period as well as certain groups of shareholders (based typically on whether they acquired their shares in
a single offering or exchange transaction) who are not individually 5-percent shareholders. 

 As
the Company will require cash infusions in order to implement its business plan, and as it is probable, although not guaranteed, that
such funding needs may be met through the sale of equity securities to 5-percent shareholders , the Company recognized a
valuation allowance equal to the deferred Tax Asset and the Company recorded a valuation allowance reducing all deferred tax assets to
0.

that the information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Commission s rules and forms
and to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934 is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including its principal executive and principal financial
officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. David Koos
is the Company s CEO and functions as the Company s principal executive officer and principal financial officer respectively. 

 b)

 Management
of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule
13a-15(f) promulgated under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934. Rule 13a-15(f) defines internal control over financial reporting
as follows: 

 The
term internal control over financial reporting is defined as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the issuer's principal
executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the issuer's board of directors,
management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation
of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies
and procedures that: 

 Pertain
to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets
of the issuer; 

 Provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the issuer are being made only in accordance with authorizations
of management and directors of the issuer; and 

 Provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the issuer's assets
that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 

 The
Company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed under the supervision of the Company s management
to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the Company s financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 

 In
designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, our management recognized that disclosure controls and procedures, no
matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only a reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the disclosure
controls and procedures are met. 

 The
Company s management assessed the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2021 is based
on the framework in 2013 Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, or COSO. Based on its assessment, management
believes that, as of September 30, 2018 the Company s internal control over financial reporting is effective.

and Exchange Commission that permit the company to provide only management's report in this annual report. This exemption for smaller
reporting companies provided under the temporary rules referenced above has been made permanent under Section 989G of the Dodd-Frank

Code
of Ethics 

On
September 25, 2013 we adopted a Code of Ethics pursuant to Section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. 

 Director
Independence 

 Audit
Committee and Audit Committee Financial Expert 

 The
members of the Company s board of Directors may not be considered independent. The Company is not a listed company 
under Securities and Exchange Commission SEC rules and is therefore not required to have an audit committee comprised
of independent directors. The Company does not currently have an audit committee, however, for certain purposes of the rules and regulations
of the SEC and in accordance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the Company s Board of Directors is deemed to be its audit committee
and as such functions as an audit committee and performs some of the same functions as an audit committee including: (1) selection and
oversight of our independent accountant; (2) establishing procedures for the receipt, retention and treatment of complaints regarding
accounting, internal controls and auditing matters; and (3) engaging outside advisors. The Board of Directors has determined that its
member is able to read and understand fundamental financial statements and has substantial business experience that results in that member's
financial sophistication. Accordingly, the Board of Directors believes that its member has the sufficient knowledge and experience necessary
to fulfill the duties and obligations that an audit committee would have. 

 Nominating
and Compensation Committees 

 The
Company does not have standing nominating or compensation committees, or committees performing similar functions. The board of directors
believes that it is not necessary to have a compensation committee at this time because the functions of such committee are adequately
performed by the board of directors. The board of directors also is of the view that it is appropriate for the Company not to have a
standing nominating committee because the board of directors has performed and will perform adequately the functions of a nominating
committee. The Company is not a listed company under SEC rules and is therefore not required to have a compensation committee
or a nominating committee. 

 Shareholder
Communications 

 There
has not been any defined policy or procedure requirements for stockholders to submit recommendations or nomination for directors. There
are no specific, minimum qualifications that the board of directors believes must be met by a candidate recommended by the board of directors.
Currently, the entire board of directors decides on nominees, on the recommendation of any member of the board of directors followed
by the board s review of the candidates resumes and interview of candidates. Based on the information gathered, the board
of directors then makes a decision on whether to recommend the candidates as nominees for director. The Company does not pay any fee
to any third party or parties to identify or evaluate or assist in identifying or evaluating potential nominee. 

 Because
the Chief Executive Officer of the Company is also the Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Company, the Board of Directors has
determined not to adopt a formal methodology for communications from shareholders on the belief that any communication would be brought
to the Board of Directors attention by virtue of the co-extensive capacities of the Chairman of the Board of Directors.
