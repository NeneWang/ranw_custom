 PART I 
 
 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 
 Overview 
 Plexus Corp. and its subsidiaries (together "Plexus," the "Company," or "we") participate in the Electronic Manufacturing Services ("EMS") industry. Since 1979, we have been partnering with companies to create the products that build a better world. We are a team of approximately 19,200 individuals who are dedicated to providing global Design and Development, Supply Chain Solutions, New Product Introduction, Manufacturing and Aftermarket Services. We are a global leader that specializes in serving customers in industries with highly complex products and demanding regulatory environments. We deliver customer service excellence to leading global companies in the Industrial, Healthcare/Life Sciences and Aerospace/Defense market sectors by providing innovative, comprehensive solutions throughout the product s lifecycle. We provide these innovative solutions to customers in the Americas ("AMER"), Asia-Pacific ("APAC") and Europe, Middle East and Africa ("EMEA") regions. 
 Our Vision, Mission and Strategy 
 Our vision is to help create the products that build a better world. Our mission is to be the leader in highly complex products and demanding regulatory environments. Our strategy to fulfill our vision and mission remains consistent and can be summarized in four parts: market focus, superior execution, passion meets purpose and discipline by design. 
 Market Focus We engineer innovative solutions for customers in growth markets and focus on partnering with leading as well as disruptive global companies in the Industrial, Healthcare/Life Sciences and Aerospace/Defense sectors. 
 Superior Execution Superior execution is foundational to our differentiation. We are dedicated partners to our customers, committed to achieving zero defects and perfect delivery through operational excellence. 
 Passion Meets Purpose Through our collective passion, we drive purpose to our actions and decisions in pursuit of operational excellence. Guided by our values and leadership behaviors, we do the right thing to support our team members, communities and customers. 
 Discipline by Design Finally, we are committed to delivering shareholder value over the long term through a consistent and disciplined financial model focused on driving industry-leading revenue growth and superior return on invested capital. 
 To deliver on our strategy, we align our operations, processes, workforce and financial metrics to create a high performance, accountable organization with a talented and engaged workforce deeply passionate about driving growth through customer service excellence. We also promote a collaborative, customer-centric culture that continuously evaluates and optimizes our business processes with a goal of creating shareholder value. Finally, we execute to customer-driven and sector-based go-to-market strategies. 
 Financial Model 
 Our financial model aligns with our business strategy. Our primary long-term focus is to earn a return on invested capital ("ROIC") 500 basis points above our weighted average cost of capital ("WACC"), which we refer to as "economic return." We review our internal calculation of WACC annually; for fiscal 2021, our WACC was 8.1 . We believe economic return is a fundamental driver of shareholder value. By exercising discipline to generate an economic return, our goal is to ensure that we create value for our shareholders. For more information regarding ROIC and economic return, which are non-GAAP financial measures, refer to "Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition - Results of Operations - Return on Invested Capital ("ROIC") and economic return" in Part II, Item 7. For a reconciliation of ROIC and economic return to our financial statements that were prepared using generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. ("U.S. GAAP" or "GAAP"), see Exhibit 99.1 to this annual report on Form 10-K, which exhibit is incorporated herein by reference. 
 
 Relative to our competition, overriding factors such as lower manufacturing volumes, production flexibility, unique fulfillment requirements and complex regulatory requirements typically result in higher investments in inventory and selling and administrative costs for us. The cost variance from our competitors is especially evident relative to those that provide EMS services for high-volume, less complex products, with less stringent requirements (e.g., consumer electronics). 
 Operations 
 Plexus is a Wisconsin-headquartered corporation with approximately 19,200 employees, including over 4,400 engineers and technologists dedicated to product development and design, test equipment development and design, and manufacturing process

 development and control, all of whom operate from 26 active facilities, totaling approximately 4.5 million square feet. Plexus' newest facility located in Bangkok, Thailand, opening in fiscal 2022, will expand Plexus' current capacity by approximately 400,000 square feet. Plexus' facilities are strategically located to support the global supply chain, engineering, manufacturing and aftermarket service needs of customers in our targeted market sectors. 
 Go-to-Market Strategy 
 We accomplish our go-to-market strategy through the three market sectors we serve, Industrial, Healthcare/Life Sciences and Aerospace/Defense. Each sector has a market sector vice president, as well as business development and customer management leaders who together oversee and provide leadership to teams that include business development leaders, customer management leaders, supply chain, engineering and manufacturing subject matter experts, and market sector analysts. These teams maintain expertise related to each market sector and execute sector strategies aligned to that market s unique delivery, quality and regulatory requirements. 
 
 Our market sector teams help define Plexus strategy for growth with a particular emphasis on expanding the value-add solutions we offer customers. Our sales and marketing efforts focus on targeting new customers and expanding our engagements with existing customers. We believe our ability to provide a full range of services that complement the entire product lifecycle across a global footprint provides a business advantage. 
 Solutions 
 With integrated design and development, supply chain solutions, new product introduction, manufacturing and aftermarket services, we proactively tackle tough challenges throughout the product lifecycle. It is how our teams strive to create innovative and efficient paths to get products to market. 
 Design and Development Plexus was established with engineering as a core competency and has built a reputation for success. Our customers are able to partner with a collaborative team of over 600 development engineers to create new products. Using the same tools and processes throughout our seven Design Centers worldwide, we leverage the latest technology and state-of-the-art design automation methodologies to provide comprehensive new product development and product commercialization solutions. 
 Supply Chain Solutions Delivering an optimal supply chain solution is more than simply getting a product where it needs to be on time. We take a unique approach. Our supply chain experts engage in all of Plexus integrated solutions, working closely with our engineers to identify opportunities for supply chain optimization early in the design stage. At Plexus, we take pride in managing the full supply chain to minimize cost, mitigate risk and provide a flexible, scalable solution for our customers. 
 New Product Introduction When introducing a new product, customers need to move quickly. Plexus offers a dedicated team focused on decreasing time to market with a full suite of integrated new product introduction services. Through early integration and collaboration, customers can take advantage of Plexus capabilities, such as design for excellence (DFX), specialized design of test solutions and rapid prototyping, while the program is advanced by a dedicated Plexus team that supports a transition to volume manufacturing. 
 Manufacturing Our approach to manufacturing focuses on innovation, continuous improvement and superior quality and delivery. With a global footprint and scalable operations, we aim to tailor our manufacturing environment to meet each customer s needs worldwide. As we strive for zero defects, we empower all employees with the knowledge that exceptional quality begins with each individual member of our team. We believe our capabilities and our culture position us to support the complex technology and regulatory needs of the industries we serve and to provide customers with innovative and dependable manufacturing services. 
 Aftermarket Services From product deployment through a product s end of life, Plexus offers a full range of aftermarket services with the ability to support customers in all regions in which we operate. We help our customers manage and extend the lifecycle of their products through an optimized level of service. With services such as depot repair, service parts logistics management, order management, distribution and warehousing and recycling, we are committed to protecting and supporting the success of each customer s product in the marketplace. 
 We provide most of our optimized solutions on a turnkey basis, and we typically procure all materials required for product assembly. We provide select services on a consignment basis, meaning the customer supplies the necessary materials and Plexus provides the labor and other services required for product assembly. In addition to manufacturing, turnkey service requires material procurement and warehousing and involves greater resource investments than consignment services. Other than certain test equipment, manufacturing equipment and software used for internal operations, we do not design or manufacture our own proprietary products.

 Regulatory Requirements 
 All Plexus manufacturing and engineering facilities are certified to a baseline Quality Management System standard per ISO9001:2015. We have capabilities to assemble finished medical devices meeting FDA Quality Systems Regulation requirements and similar regulatory requirements in other countries. 
 
 We have additional certifications and/or registrations held by certain facilities in the following regions: 
 AMER APAC EMEA Medical Standard ISO 13485:2016 X X X 21 CFR Part 820 (FDA) (Finished Medical) X X X JMGP accreditation X X X GMP-Korea certification X X ANVISA accreditation X X X NPMA (National Medical Products Administration) registration X ISO 14001(environmental management) X X X ISO 45001 (occupational health and safety) X X ANSI/ESD (Electrostatic Discharge Control Program) S20.20 X X ITAR (International Traffic and Arms Regulation) self-declaration X Aerospace Standard AS9100 X X X NADCAP certification X X X FAR 145 certification (FAA repair station) X EASA repair approval X ATEX/IECEx certification X IRIS certification (Railway) X ISO 50001:2011 (energy management) X 
 Customers and Market Sectors Served 
 Our customers range from large multinational companies to smaller emerging technology companies. During fiscal 2021, we served approximately 140 customers. General Electric Company ("GE") accounted for 11.2 , 11.7 and 12.4 of our net sales during fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. No other customer accounted for 10.0 or more of our net sales in any of the last three fiscal years. Net sales to our largest customers may vary from time to time depending on the size and timing of customer program commencements, terminations, delays, modifications and transitions. We generally do not obtain firm, long-term purchase commitments from our customers. Customers' forecasts can and do change as a result of changes in their end-market demand and other factors, including global economic conditions. Any material change in forecasts or orders from these major accounts, or other customers, could materially affect our results of operations. The loss of any major customer could have a significant negative impact on our financial results. In addition, as our percentage of net sales to customers in a specific sector becomes larger relative to other sectors, we will become increasingly dependent upon the economic and business conditions affecting that sector. Many of our large customers, including GE, contract with us through multiple independent divisions, subsidiaries, production facilities or locations. We believe that in most cases our sales to any one such division, subsidiary, facility or location are independent of sales to others. 
 
 The distribution of our net sales by market sectors for the indicated fiscal years is shown in the following table. In fiscal 2021, we consolidated the prior Industrial/Commercial and Communications market sectors to form the Industrial market sector: 
 Industry 2021 2020 2019 Industrial 46 45 43 Healthcare/Life Sciences 39 37 38 Aerospace/Defense 15 18 19 Total net sales 100 100 100 
 Prior periods have been revised to reflect the consolidation of the Industrial/Commercial and Communications sector.

 Although our current business development focus is based on our targeted market sectors of Industrial, Healthcare/Life Sciences and Aerospace/Defense, we evaluate our financial performance and allocate our resources geographically (see Note 11 "Reportable Segments, Geographic Information and Major Customers" in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements regarding our reportable segments). Plexus offers a uniform array of services for customers in each market sector and, aside from the specific go-to-market teams, generally we do not dedicate operational equipment, personnel, facilities or other resources to particular market sectors, nor do we internally track our costs and resources per market sector. 
 
 Plexus serves a diverse customer landscape that includes industry-leading, branded product companies, along with other technology pioneering start-ups and emerging companies that may or may not maintain manufacturing capabilities. In addition to prime technology advancements, key government and policy trends impact our business, including the U.S. Food and Drug Administration s ("FDA") approval of new medical devices, defense procurement practices and other government and regulatory processes. Plexus may benefit from increasing trends by original equipment manufacturers to outsource the design, manufacture and service of their products. 
 Materials and Suppliers 
 We typically purchase raw materials, including printed circuit boards and electronic components, from manufacturers and distributors. Under certain circumstances, we will purchase components from brokers, customers or competitors. The key electronic components we purchase include: specialized components, semiconductors, interconnect products, electronic subassemblies (including memory modules, power supply modules and cable and wire harnesses), inductors, resistors and capacitors. 
 
 We also purchase non-electronic, typically custom engineered, components used in manufacturing and higher-level assembly. These components include molded/formed plastics, sheet metal fabrications, aluminum extrusions, robotics, motors, vision sensors, motion/actuation, fluidics, displays, die castings and various other hardware and fastener components. These components are sourced from both Plexus preferred suppliers and customer directed suppliers. Components range from standard to highly customized and vary widely in terms of market availability and price. 
 
 Component shortages and subsequent allocations by our suppliers are an inherent risk to the electronics industry and have particularly been an issue for us and the industry during fiscal 2021. We discuss the causes of these shortages more fully in "Risk Factors" in Part I, Item 1A herein. 
 
 Plexus' global supply chain management organization attempts to mitigate potential supply chain risks and ensure a steady flow of components and products at competitive prices. We strive to achieve these goals through advanced supply chain solutions we develop in partnership with our customers, a commitment to strong supplier partnerships, risk management tools, proprietary supply chain risk algorithms and global expediting processes. Plexus can often influence the selection of new product components, primarily when engaged to provide design and development solutions. 
 Competition 
 Plexus operates in a highly competitive market, with a goal to be best-in-class at meeting the unique needs of our customers. With integrated design and development, supply chain solutions, new product introduction, manufacturing and aftermarket services, we proactively tackle tough challenges throughout the product lifecycle. A number of competitors may provide electronics manufacturing and engineering services similar to Plexus. Others may be more established in certain industry sectors, or have greater financial, manufacturing or marketing resources. Smaller competitors compete mainly in specific sectors and within limited geographic areas. Plexus also competes with in-house capabilities of current and potential customers. Plexus maintains awareness and knowledge of our competitors' capabilities in order to remain highly competitive within our target markets. 
 Intellectual Property 
 We own various service marks that we use in our business, which are registered in the trademark offices of the United States and other countries. Although we own certain patents, they are not currently material to our business. We do not have any material copyrights. 
 Information Technology 
 Our core solutions for manufacturing facilities include a single-instance Enterprise Resource Planning ("ERP") system, as well as Product Data Management and Advanced Planning and Scheduling systems, along with consistent solutions for warehouse management and shop floor execution, that support our global operations. This consistency augments our other management information systems, allowing us to standardize our ability to translate data from multiple production facilities into operational and financial information required by the business. The related software licenses are of a general commercial character on terms

 customary for these types of agreements. In addition, taking advantage of virtualization technology, we are able to see gains in efficiency and up-time supporting our critical operations. 
 
 We strive to promote innovation technologies, solutions and processes within our information technology ("IT") infrastructure to enable Plexus to differentiate from our competition. As technology solutions continue to evolve, so do the myriad of risks introduced to the organization. The delivery of business value through technology is highly dependent on the holistic identification and management of information technology risks. Plexus' IT Risk Management Program promotes data-driven decision making through a collaborative effort to improve IT and cybersecurity resiliency, including a governance framework that facilitates awareness, oversight accountabilities and risk management activities across the business. Continuously enhancing our environment to meet the increasing needs of cybersecurity and privacy regulations remains a top priority. We discuss the risks relating to cybersecurity and their potential impact on us more fully in "Risk Factors" in Part I, Item 1A herein. 
 Compliance with Laws and Regulations 
 As a global public company that supports manufacturing, designing and servicing highly complex products in demanding regulatory environments, our operations are subject to a variety of laws, regulations and compliance obligations. We strive to implement robust internal controls, quality management systems and management systems of compliance that govern our internal actions and mitigate our risk of non-compliance. We also make efforts to identify non-compliance concerns through internal and external audits, risk assessments as well as an ethics hotline reporting system. 
 
 We are also subject to a variety of regulations associated with environmental compliance, as well as those governing employee health and safety. These regulations are related to topics such as: monitoring, tracking and reporting of air and water emissions; handling and disposing of hazardous chemicals used during our manufacturing process; and evaluating and mitigating employee health and safety hazards in our facilities. 
 
 We believe that we are in material compliance with all such applicable laws and regulations, and we do not anticipate any significant additional expenditures related to maintaining our compliance. However, due to the sometimes rapidly evolving nature of these laws and regulations (including as a result of COVID-19), geopolitical complexity and uncertainty and changing requirements applicable to our environmental, social and governance ("ESG") program, there can be no assurance that current expenditures will be adequate or that violations will not occur. Any violations could result in fines, penalties, customer disengagements or reputational damage that may have a material impact on our financial performance. See Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A, herein, for more detail around risks pertaining to compliance with laws and regulations. 
 Environmental, Social and Governance 
 Consistent with our vision to help our customers create the products that build a better world, we are committed to building a better world by the way in which we operate. Plexus' ESG program strives to build strong communities, protect our environment, develop our team members in a culture that is both diverse and inclusive, embraces strong governance practices in the interest of our shareholders and sets similar expectations of our supply chain partners. When we focus on improving outcomes for all of our stakeholders, we maximize our ability to achieve our strategic objectives and deliver long-term financial value for our shareholders. Plexus has established an ESG program that focuses on five key areas: (1) responsible employer; (2) community partner; (3) global citizen; (4) industry steward; and (5) corporate governance. 
 Responsible Employer We advocate for diversity, combat human trafficking, encourage and provide employee development opportunities, strive to ensure safe and healthy working conditions, promote an appropriate work/life balance for our employees, encourage wellness initiatives and reinforce responsible values in our culture. 
 Community Partner We promote and financially contribute to science, technology, engineering and mathematics ("STEM") programs, as well as causes that make a meaningful impact to the communities in which we operate. We encourage our employees involvement in community charitable organizations, as well as volunteerism, and we partner with community organizations to promote local business. 
 Global Citizen We actively work to reduce waste, water use and greenhouse gas emissions from our operations and work with suppliers to develop similar programs. We partner with customers to help design more efficient and environmentally friendly products as well as limit product end of life environmental impact through our aftermarket services solution. 
 Industry Steward We take an active role in industry coalitions focused on reducing impacts to the environment, maintaining strong ethical practices and establishing safe and healthy working conditions around the world. We train our supply chain on important social initiatives, such as detecting and preventing forced labor, and we collaborate with customers to advance sustainability efforts.

Table of Contents 

 Corporate Governance Strong leadership and a culture of accountability are foundational at Plexus. Our executive management, in collaboration with our Board of Directors, competently and ethically manage Plexus operations for the long-term benefit of shareholders. 
 Plexus is committed to responsible business practices throughout our global operations. As a member of the Responsible Business Alliance ("RBA"), we have taken an active role in improving not only our own practices, but influencing and holding others accountable throughout our supply chain. In addition to RBA membership, we consider a variety of standards for responsible practices, including, but not limited to, local and federal legal requirements in the jurisdictions where we operate, the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board ("SASB") and the Carbon Disclosure Project. 
 Human Capital Management 
 We are driven to differentiate Plexus with our talent and by our culture. How we manage our human capital is critical to how we deliver on our strategy and create sustained growth and value for our shareholders. 
 Purpose and Culture 
 We recognize that a great culture is foundational to the success of our vision to create the products that build a better world. We are proud of our culture and the recognition we have received over the years as a great place to work. In building a great culture, we embrace four "non-negotiables": 
 Our Values and Leadership Behaviors Our Values and Leadership Behaviors establish the foundation upon which our culture is built, representing key expectations we have of our employees and emblematic of the work environment we strive to create. Our 10 Values and Leadership Behaviors are: Customer Focus, Relationships and Teamwork, Excellence, Open Communication, Integrity, Prioritize our People, Solve Problems, Be Courageous, Be Strategic and Innovate. 
 Quality Begins with Me We instill personal responsibility for quality in our employees through our Quality Begins with Me culture; a commitment to delivering zero defects and continuous improvement. A culture concentrated on each individual s pledge that quality is critical to achieving our strategic goal of superior execution in delivering highly complex products in demanding regulatory environments. 
 5Es of Customer Service Excellence Through the 5Es of Customer Service Excellence, we describe for our employees what is required to exceed our customer s expectations and enable growth through customer service excellence. In all aspects of our engagements, with both internal and external customers, we reflect the 5Es: We are Empathetic, Entrepreneurial, Empowered, Engaged, and we Ensure Accountability. 
 One Plexus One Plexus reflects our sentiment that we are stronger together than the sum of our parts. We embrace the One Plexus mentality through collaboration to ensure consistent operations, globally, and leverage the strengths and best practices of all facets of the organization to drive the best solutions for our customers. 
 Commitment to Values and Ethics 
 Along with our Values and Leadership Behaviors, we act in accordance with our Code of Conduct and Business Ethics ("Code of Conduct"), which creates expectations and provides guidance for all employees to make the right decisions. Our Code of Conduct includes topics such as anti-corruption, discrimination, harassment, privacy, appropriate use of company assets, protecting confidential information and reporting Code of Conduct violations. It is used to reinforce our passion for operating in a fair, honest, responsible and ethical manner and articulates our responsibilities as a trusted leader in the business community. The Code of Conduct also emphasizes the importance of having an open, welcoming environment in which all employees feel empowered to do what is right and are encouraged to voice concerns should violations of the Code of Conduct be observed. All employees are required to complete the training on the Code of Conduct annually. 
 Diversity and Inclusion 
 At Plexus, diversity and inclusion ("D I") does not simply mean representation. It means encouraging engagement, inclusion of all employees ideas and perspectives and association among the global locations in which we operate proudly representing the more than 14 countries our team members call home. We have adopted the following D I mission statement at Plexus, which is directly incorporated into our Code of Conduct: 
 "Our people create our best Plexus. Ingrained in our culture of inclusion is the philosophy that each individual offers diverse perspectives, backgrounds and experiences that create great outcomes when we are united as a team. We respect our people and embrace our differences. We welcome everyone and value the ideas generated by our collective uniqueness. We aspire that all of our teammates reach their full potential and we encourage them to simply, BE YOU!"

 Our strategy to enhance diversity at Plexus and to foster an inclusive culture includes the following: 
 D I Committee and Board Oversight To oversee strategic objectives and to ensure appropriate accountabilities exist to support our diversity and inclusion efforts, our executive leadership committee structure includes a Diversity and Inclusion Committee, made up of key members of executive management, including our Chief Executive Officer. In addition, our Compensation and Leadership Development Committee of our Board of Directors reviews the initiatives and results to cultivate a diverse workforce and inclusive culture. 
 Employee Resource Groups Our Employee Resource Groups ("ERGs") are voluntary, employee-driven groups organized around common interests and legitimate business purposes. Plexus current ERGs include Plexus Young Professionals ("PYP"), UnusPlexus and Women in Network ("WiN"). The goal of PYP is to create an environment that fosters collaboration and development for the young professionals at Plexus. UnusPlexus purpose is to celebrate the different cultures and diversity existing within Plexus. WiN has a mission to champion the advancement of women in their professional and personal development through various career and life changes. These groups are directly supported by executive-level leadership and management engages regularly in support of ERG programming. Plexus supports further expansion and enhancement efforts of existing ERGs as well as employee-driven creation of new ERGs. 
 Mentoring Training Plexus has established a formal mentoring program that aids in the development and retention of diverse talent, with a specific focus on future leaders within our underrepresented populations. In addition, the Company has invested in D I leadership training on the value of diversity and how best to foster an inclusive culture. This training focuses on enhancing understanding of unconscious bias and enhancing the skills to being an inclusive leader. 
 Gender Underrepresented Minorities Recruitment Strategy Our talent acquisition teams have a strategic initiative to widen the funnel of talent seeking to join Plexus. Efforts in this space are customized by geography based on the current workforce dynamic. This includes partnerships with organizations such as Society of Women Engineering ("SWE"), universities with diverse student populations and minority groups supporting underrepresented minorities with leadership aspirations across many disciplines. 
 Employee Benefits Programs Plexus has a number of policies and benefits in place to support the unique needs and overall wellbeing of our team members and their families, including flexible workplace, paid parental leave and a Plexus Wellness Program to ensure our employees have access to the resources they need to lead healthy, balanced lives. 
 Community Involvement Volunteerism Community involvement, volunteering and charitable giving are important to ensure we are investing and promoting positive impacts in the communities in which we operate and where our employees live. We offer an employee charitable match program in our AMER region for employees to use, and we plan to implement a similar program in our EMEA and APAC regions. Plexus also offers employees paid, volunteer time off for team members who want to give back at qualified organizations or community events. 
 Talent Development Acquisition 
 In the pursuit of excellence, we nurture and grow our people. Our commitment to holistic talent management means that we expect and reward high performance and address underperformance with urgency, candor and empathy. Our team members receive and provide feedback with humility and a sincere interest to continuously improve. We engage in regular talent reviews to calibrate on the performance and potential of our teammates, their development needs, career pathing and the strength of our succession plans. Competency-based training, leadership development programs and online learning provide the foundation for a learning culture and ongoing development for team members at all levels. While our goal is to develop our own talent, we recruit technical, new graduate and experienced talent by valuing potential as well as experience and personality traits that align with our Values and Leadership Behaviors. 
 Employee Engagement 
 At every facility, in every organization and at all levels, we strive to continuously improve the engagement of our teammates. We survey employee engagement annually through our employee net promotor score and we identify and act on areas of opportunity to enhance our work environment and increase employee satisfaction. 
 Compensation 
 Our philosophy is to competitively compensate all employees for their contributions to Plexus and to appropriately motivate employees to provide value to Plexus' shareholders. To ensure compensation is competitive, performance-based and fair, we are disciplined in the way we establish and evaluate pay. We assign each role a pay range based on its job accountabilities and the pay practices for similar roles in the marketplace. Employees are compensated within their applicable pay range based on a

 number of factors, including the employee's education, experience, performance and potential. At least annually, we reevaluate employee pay based on these criteria. Short and long-term incentive pay is designed to be competitive, improve employee retention, reward employees for performance supporting our strategic objectives and align employees with the interests of shareholders to deliver both short-term and long-term results. Approximately 20.0 and 3.1 of our employees participate in our short and long-term incentive programs, respectively. 
 Worker Rights, Health, and Safety 
 We are committed to complying with applicable laws, including those associated with labor and employment, across all areas of our operations. In addition, as an active member of RBA, we abide by their global standards, irrespective of legal requirements, regarding the treatment of workers. These include prevention of excessive working hours and unfair wages, controls to prohibit child labor and human trafficking and bolstering workplace health and safety measures. We are one of several companies actively partnering with the RBA to abolish human trafficking by holding foreign labor agencies accountable to upholding sound recruiting processes. 
 
 To protect team members during the COVID-19 outbreak, Plexus has progressively implemented measures to safeguard our employees from COVID-19 infection and exposure based on those established by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control, U.S. Occupational Health and Safety as well as the World Health Organization. These safeguards consist of policies, procedures, protocols and guidance related to, among other things, COVID-19 symptom awareness, effective hygiene practices, travel restrictions, visitor vetting and screening, social distancing, face covering expectations, work-from-home requirements, enhanced workplace cleaning and decontamination. In addition, we have hosted free on-site vaccination clinics at our facilities and provided free transportation to vaccination sites for our employees in the United States, Mexico, Malaysia and Romania in order to make it as easy as possible for employees to be vaccinated. 
 Human Capital Management Governance 
 As part of our governance structure, we have established an Organizational Performance Committee, an executive body comprised of the Chief Executive Officer, VP of Human Resources and other executives that oversee our human capital strategy. In addition, our VP of Human Resources and other key leaders within our Human Resources organization provide a quarterly update to the Compensation and Leadership Development Committee of the Board of Directors on our strategy for talent development and retention, including succession planning for key talent. Management also updates the Board of Directors regularly on employee-related policies and efforts intended to protect our employees and to preserve our corporate culture, such as the regular review of our Code of Conduct and Business Ethics, diversity and inclusion initiatives, employee net promoter survey results and our ethics hotline activity. The Board of Directors also maintains regular visibility into our COVID-19 response strategy. 
 Employee Data 
 We employ approximately 19,200 team members. Of these, 49.9 are female, 50.0 are male and 0.1 choose not to identify. The majority of our workforce, 52.4 , is located in our APAC region, while 35.5 and 12.1 of our employees are located in our AMER and EMEA regions, respectively. Approximately 2,050 and 190 of our respective employees in Mexico and the United Kingdom are covered by union agreements. These union agreements are typically renewed at the beginning of each year, although in a few cases these agreements may last two or more years. Our employees in China, Germany, Malaysia, Romania and the United States are not covered by union agreements. We have no history of labor disputes at any of our facilities, and we believe that our employee relationships are positive and stable. Given the quick response times required by our customers, we seek to maintain flexibility to scale our operations as necessary to maximize efficiency. To do so, we use skilled temporary labor in addition to our full-time employees.

 ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 
 Material risk factors to our business and financial performance are those that may impact our strategy, which is centered around four strategic pillars: Market Focus, Superior Execution, Passion Meets Purpose and Discipline by Design . This section lays out a number of material risks that may impact those strategic pillars. Other sections of this report also include risks that may impact our strategic business objectives and affect our financial performance. The risks included herein and elsewhere in this report are not exhaustive. In addition, due to the dynamic nature of our business, new risks may emerge from time to time and it is not possible for management to predict or assess the impact of all such risks on our business. 
 
 Risks impacting our MARKET FOCUS We engineer innovative solutions for customers in growth markets with highly complex products and demanding regulatory environments. 

The end markets we serve require technologically advanced products and such markets may be impacted by a number of factors that could adversely impact our customers demand. 
 Factors affecting the technology-dependent end markets that we serve could adversely affect our customers and, as a result, Plexus. These factors include: 
 
 customers ability or inability to adapt to rapidly changing technologies and evolving industry standards that can result in short product life-cycles or product obsolescence 
 customers ability or inability to develop and market their products, some of which are new and untested, and 
 the potential failure of our customers products to gain widespread commercial acceptance. 
 
 Even if our customers successfully respond to these market challenges, their responses, including any consequential changes we must make in our business relationships, services offered, or to our operations, can affect our production cycles, inventory management and results of operations. 
 
 Our customers do not make long-term commitments to us and may cancel or change their production requirements. 
 
 We generally do not obtain firm, long-term purchase commitments from our customers, and frequently do not have visibility as to their future demand for our services. Customers also cancel, change or delay design, production or aftermarket service quantities and schedules, or fail to meet their forecasts for a number of reasons beyond our control. Customer expectations can change rapidly, requiring us to take on additional commitments or risks. In addition, customers may fail to meet their commitments to us or our expectations. Cancellations, reductions or delays by a significant customer, or by a group of customers, could seriously harm our operating results and negatively affect our working capital levels. Such cancellations, reductions or delays have occurred from time to time and may continue to occur in the future. This risk continues to be heightened by potential volatility in end market demand for our customers' products or our services likely as a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. 
 
 In addition, we make significant decisions based on our estimates of customers demand, including determining the levels of business that we will seek and accept, production schedules, component procurement commitments, working capital (including inventory) management, facility and capacity requirements, personnel needs and other resource requirements. The short-term nature of our customers commitments and the possibility of rapid changes in demand for their products affect our ability to accurately estimate their future requirements. Because certain of our operating expenses are fixed, a reduction in customer demand can harm our operating results. The need for us to correctly anticipate component needs is amplified in times of shortages. The current environment of tight component supply, which continues to be impacted by global pandemic-related interruptions, can increase the difficulties and cost of anticipating changing demand. Moreover, because our margins vary across customers and specific programs, a reduction in demand with higher margin customers or programs will have a more significant adverse effect on our operating results. 
 
 Rapid increases in customer demand may stress personnel and other capacity resources. We may not have sufficient resources, including personnel and components, at any given time to meet all of our customers demands or to meet the requirements of a specific program, which could result in a loss of business from such customers.

Table of Contents 

 The majority of our net sales come from a relatively small number of customers and a limited number of market sectors; if we lose a major customer or program or if there are challenges in those market sectors, then our net sales and operating results could decline significantly. 
 
 Net sales to our 10 largest customers have represented a majority of our net sales in recent periods. Our 10 largest customers accounted for 55.2 of our net sales fiscal 2021 and 2020. During each of these periods there was one customer that represented 10.0 or more of our net sales. 
 Our major customers may vary from period to period, and our major customers may not continue to purchase services from us at current levels, or at all, particularly given the volatile or temporary nature of certain programs. In any given period, a higher portion of our sales may be concentrated with customers or projects with relatively lower margins, which could adversely affect our results. We have experienced from time to time, and in the future may experience, significant disengagements with customers or of programs, adverse changes in customer supply chain strategies and the end of life of significant programs. Especially given our discrete number of customers, the loss of, or significant reductions in net sales to, any of our major customers or our failure to make appropriate choices as to the customers we serve could seriously harm our business and results of operations. 
 
 In addition, we focus our sales efforts on customers in only a few market sectors, as identified in Part I, Item 1, herein. Each of these sectors is subject to macroeconomic conditions, as well as trends and conditions that are sector specific. Any weakness in our customers end markets could affect our business and results of operations. Economic, business or regulatory conditions that affect the sector, or our failure to choose to do business in appropriate sectors, can particularly impact us. For instance, sales in the Healthcare/Life Sciences sector are substantially affected by trends in the healthcare industry, such as government reimbursement rates and uncertainties relating to the U.S. healthcare sector, generally. In addition, the Healthcare/Life Sciences sector is affected by global health pandemics, such as COVID-19, which has created both opportunities and challenges for us. For example, the pandemic initially caused an increase in sales specific to products supporting pandemic relief efforts and critical care products, which demand has now leveled out or softened. More recently, sales related to elective procedures or other non-critical care products, which weakened at the outset of the pandemic, have strengthened. Commercial aerospace continues to be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in decreased demand from our commercial aerospace customers. Additionally, the semiconductor industry has historically been subject to significant cyclicality and volatility. Further, potential reductions in U.S. government agency spending, including those due to budget cuts or other political developments or issues, could affect opportunities in all of our market sectors. 
 
 We rely on timely and regular payments from our customers, and the inability or failure of our major customers to meet their obligations to us or their bankruptcy, insolvency or liquidation may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We also have receivables factoring agreements in place; therefore, deterioration in the payment experience with or credit quality of our major customers we factor, or issues with the banking counterparties to our factoring agreements, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations due to our inability to factor such receivables. 
 
 From time to time, our customers have been affected by merger, acquisition, divestiture and spin-off activity. While these transactions may present us with opportunities to capture new business, they also create the risk that these customers will partially reduce their purchases or completely disengage from us as a result of transitioning such business to our competitors or their internal operations. 
 
 We and our customers are subject to increasingly extensive government regulations, legal requirements and industry standards; a failure to comply with current and future regulations, requirements and standards could have an adverse effect on our business, customer relationships, reputation and profitability. 
 
 We are subject to extensive government regulation, legal requirements and industry standards (as well as customer-specific standards) relating to the products we design, manufacture and service as well as how we conduct our business. This includes regulations and standards relating to labor and employment practices, workplace health and safety, the environment, sourcing and import/export practices, the market sectors we support and many other facets of our operations. The regulatory climate in the U.S. and other countries has become increasingly complex and fragmented, and regulatory enforcement activity has increased in recent periods. A failure to comply with laws, regulations or standards applicable to our business can result in, among other consequences, fines, injunctions, civil penalties, criminal prosecution, recall or seizure of devices, total or partial suspension of production, including debarment, and could have an adverse effect on our reputation, customer relationships, profitability and results of operations.

 Our Healthcare/Life Sciences sector is subject to statutes and regulations covering the design, development, testing, manufacturing, labeling and servicing of medical devices and the reporting of certain information regarding their safety, including Food and Drug Administration regulations and similar regulations in other countries. We also design, manufacture and service products for certain industries, including certain applications where the U.S. government is the end customer, that face significant regulation by the Department of Defense, Department of State, Department of Commerce, Federal Aviation Authority and other governmental agencies in the U.S. as well as in other countries, and also under the Federal Acquisition Regulation. In addition, whenever we pursue business in new sectors and subsectors, or our customers pursue new technologies or markets, we need to navigate the potentially heavy regulatory and legislative burdens of such sectors, as well as standards of quality systems, technologies or markets. 
 
 The regulatory climate can itself affect the demand for our services. For example, government reimbursement rates and other regulations, as well as the financial health of healthcare providers, and changes in how healthcare in the U.S. and other countries is structured, and how medical devices are taxed, could affect the willingness and ability of end customers to purchase the products of our customers in the Healthcare/Life Sciences sector as well as impact our margins. 
 
 Our customers are also required to comply with various government regulations, legal requirements and industry standards, including many of the industry-specific regulations discussed above. Our customers failure to comply could affect their businesses, which in turn would affect our sales to them. In addition, if our customers are required by regulation or other requirements to make changes in their product lines, these changes could significantly disrupt particular programs we have in place for these customers and create inefficiencies in our business. Failure of our customers to identify or flow down any such requirements to Plexus could result in production of non-compliant product, which could restrict their ability to sell such products, thus affecting our sales to them. 
 
 Increased competition may result in reduced demand or reduced prices for our services. 
 
 Our industry is highly competitive. We compete against numerous providers with global operations, as well as those which operate on only a local or regional basis. In addition, current and prospective customers continually evaluate the merits of designing, manufacturing and servicing products internally and may choose to design, manufacture or service products (including products or product types that we currently design, manufacture or service for them) themselves rather than outsource such activities. Consolidations and other changes in our industry may result in a changing competitive landscape. 
 Our competitors may: 
 
 respond more quickly than us to new or emerging technologies 
 have greater name recognition, critical mass and geographic and market presence 
 be better able to take advantage of acquisition opportunities 
 adapt more quickly to changes in customer requirements 
 have lower internal cost structures 
 have greater direct buying power with component suppliers and distributors 
 devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their services and execution of their strategy, and 
 be better positioned to compete on price for their services. 
 
 Our manufacturing processes are generally not subject to significant proprietary protection, and companies with greater resources or a greater market presence may enter our market or otherwise become increasingly competitive. Increased competition could result in significant price reductions, reduced sales and margins, or loss of market share. 
 
 We may fail to successfully complete future acquisitions or strategic arrangements, and may not successfully integrate acquired operations or recognize the anticipated benefits, which could adversely affect our operating results. 
 
 While we have primarily chosen an organic growth strategy in recent years, if we were to pursue future growth through acquisitions, including the acquisition of operations divested by our customers, or similar transactions, this would involve significant risks that could have a material adverse effect on us. These include operating risks such as the inability to successfully integrate businesses, systems and personnel; impacts on customer programs and relationships; and an inability to realize anticipated synergies or economies of scale. They also include financial risks such as the use of cash or incurrence of additional debt and interest expense, the potential volatility or weakness in our stock price as a result of the announcement of such transactions, the incurrence of large write-offs or write-downs and other potential financial impacts.

 Risks impacting our SUPERIOR EXECUTION We are dedicated partners to our customers, committed to achieving zero defects and perfect delivery through operational excellence. 

We have a complex business model, and our failure to properly manage or execute on that model could adversely affect our operations, financial results and reputation. 
 Our business model focuses on products and services that are highly complex and subject to demanding regulatory requirements. Our customers products typically require significant production and supply-chain flexibility necessitating optimized solutions across an integrated global platform. The products we design, manufacture and service are also typically complex, heavily regulated and require complicated configuration management and direct order fulfillment capabilities to global end customers. 
 
 Our business model requires a great degree of attention, flexibility and resources. These resources include working capital, management and technical personnel, and the development and maintenance of systems and procedures to manage diverse manufacturing, regulatory and service requirements for multiple programs of varying sizes simultaneously, including in multiple locations and geographies. We also depend on securing and ramping new customers and programs as well as transitioning production for new customers and programs, which creates added complexities related to managing the start-up risks of such projects, especially for companies that did not previously outsource such activities. 
 
 The complexity of our model, which encompasses a broad range of services including design and development, supply chain solutions, new product introduction, manufacturing and aftermarket services, often results in complex and challenging contractual obligations and unique customer requirements. In addition, program complexity and associated customer expectations have increased in recent years with respect to certain capabilities, commitments, allocation of risk and compliance with third party standards, requiring extraordinary measures to ensure operational execution and compliance within unique, non-standard engagements. This is especially relevant to our expanding aftermarket services business, where each customer program presents unique logistical, operational and supply chain risks that differ from those found in our manufacturing or engineering engagements. If we fail to meet those obligations, or are otherwise unable to execute on our commitments or unsuccessfully mitigate such risks, then it could result in claims against us, regulatory violations, or adversely affect our reputation and our ability to obtain future business, as well as impair our ability to enforce our rights (including those related to payment) under those contracts. A failure to adequately understand unique customer requirements may also impact our ability to estimate and ultimately recover associated costs, adversely affecting our financial results. 
 
 Many of the markets for our manufacturing, engineering, aftermarket and other services are characterized by rapidly changing technology and evolving process developments. Our internal processes are also subject to these factors. The sustained success of our business will depend upon our continued ability to: 
 
 retain qualified engineering and technical personnel, and attract additional qualified personnel, especially in times of tight labor markets 
 choose, maintain and enhance appropriate technological and service capabilities 
 successfully manage the implementation and execution of information systems 
 develop and market services that meet changing customer needs 
 effectively execute our services and perform to our customers expectations, and 
 successfully anticipate, or respond to, technological changes on a cost-effective and timely basis. 
 
 Although we believe that our operations utilize the technologies, equipment and processes that are currently required by our customers, we cannot be certain that we will maintain or develop the capabilities required by our customers in the future. The emergence of new technologies, industry standards or customer requirements may render our technical personnel, equipment, inventory or processes obsolete or noncompetitive. In addition, we may have to acquire new skills, technologies and equipment to remain competitive, as well as offer new or additional services, all of which may require significant expense or capital investment that could reduce our liquidity and negatively affect our operating results. Our failure to anticipate and adapt to our customers changing technological needs and requirements, or to perform to their expectations or standards, as well as our need to maintain our personnel and other resources during times of fluctuating demand, could have an adverse effect on our business.

 There may be problems with the products we design, manufacture or service that could result in liability claims against us, reduced demand for our services and damage to our reputation. 
 
 We design, manufacture and service products to our customers specifications, many of which are highly complex, for industries such as healthcare, aerospace and defense that have higher risk profiles. Despite our quality control and quality assurance efforts, problems may occur, or may be alleged, in the design, manufacturing or servicing of these products, including as a result of business continuity issues. Whether or not we are responsible, problems in the products we manufacture, whether real or alleged, whether caused by faulty customer specifications, the design or manufacturing processes, servicing or a component defect, may result in delayed shipments to customers or reduced or canceled customer orders. If these problems were to occur in large quantities or too frequently, our business reputation may also be tarnished. In addition, such problems may result in liability claims against us, whether or not we are responsible. These potential claims may include damages for the recall of a product or injury to person or property. 
 
 Even if customers or third parties, such as component suppliers, are responsible for defects, they may not, or may not be able to, assume responsibility for any such costs or required payments to us. While we seek to secure contractual protection and/or to insure against many of these risks, we may not have practical recourse against certain suppliers, and contractual protections, insurance coverage or supplier warranties, as well as our other risk mitigation efforts, may be inadequate, not cost effective or unavailable, either in general or for particular types of products or issues. We occasionally incur costs defending claims, and any such disputes could adversely affect our business relationships. 
 
 We experience component shortages, price fluctuations and supplier quality concerns. 
 
 We generally do not have long-term supply agreements. We have experienced from time to time and are currently experiencing significant component shortages and longer lead times due to supplier capacity constraints or their failure to deliver. The delays and shortages we experienced in fiscal 2021, and continue to experience, are the result of the global pandemic's impact on our suppliers and logistics providers, exacerbated by the general improvement in worldwide economic conditions as economies have emerged from the pandemic. Supply chain constraints can also be caused by world events, such as government policies, tariffs, trade wars, trade disputes and trade protection measures, terrorism, armed conflict, natural disasters, economic recession, increased demand due to economic growth, preferential allocations and other localized events. Further, we rely on a limited number of suppliers for many of the components used in the assembly process and, in some cases, may be required to use suppliers that are the sole provider of a particular component. Such suppliers may encounter quality problems, labor disputes, financial difficulties or business continuity issues that could preclude them from delivering components timely or at all. Supply shortages and delays in deliveries of components may result in delayed production of assemblies, which reduces our revenue and operating profit for the periods affected. Additionally, a delay in obtaining a particular component may result in other components for the related program being held for longer periods of time, increasing working capital, risking inventory obsolescence and negatively impacting our cash flow. We are currently experiencing higher inventory levels as a result of component shortages. 
 
 Due to the highly competitive nature of our industry, an inability to obtain sufficient inventory on a timely basis or successfully execute on our business continuity processes, could also harm relationships with our customers and lead to loss of business to our competitors. 
 
 In addition, components that are delivered to us may not meet our specifications or other quality criteria. Certain components provided to us may be counterfeit or violate the intellectual property rights of others. The need to obtain replacement materials and parts may negatively affect our manufacturing operations. The inadvertent use of any such parts or products may also give rise to liability claims. Further, the commitments made to us by our suppliers, and the terms applicable to such relationships, may not match all the commitments we make to, and the terms of our arrangements with, our customers, and such variations may lead us to incur additional expense or liability and/or cause other disruptions to our business. 
 
 Component supply shortages and delays in deliveries, along with other factors such as tariffs and trade disputes, can also result in increased pricing. While many of our customers permit quarterly or other periodic adjustments to pricing based on changes in component prices and other factors, we may bear the risk of price increases that occur between any such repricing or, if such repricing is not permitted, during the balance of the term of the particular customer contract. Conversely, as a result of our pricing strategies and practices, component price reductions have contributed positively to our operating results in the past. Our inability to continue to benefit from such reductions in the future could adversely affect our operating results.

 Our services involve other inventory risk. 
 
 Most of our services are provided on a turnkey basis, under which we purchase some, or all, of the required materials and components based on customer forecasts or orders. Although, in general, our commercial contracts with our customers obligate our customers to ultimately purchase inventory ordered to support their forecasts or orders, we generally finance these purchases initially. In addition, suppliers may require us to purchase materials and components in minimum order quantities that may exceed customer requirements. A customer s cancellation, delay or reduction of forecasts or orders can also result in excess inventory or additional expense to us. Engineering changes by a customer may result in obsolete materials or components. While we attempt to cancel, return or otherwise mitigate excess and obsolete inventory, require customers to reimburse us for these items and/or price our services to address related risks, we may not actually be reimbursed timely or in full, be able to collect on these obligations or adequately reflect such risks in our pricing. In addition to increasing inventory in certain instances to support new program ramps, we may also increase inventory if we experience component shortages or longer lead times for certain components in order to maintain a high level of customer service. In such situations, we may procure components earlier, which has led to an increase in inventory in the short term and may lead to increased, excess, or obsolete inventory in the future. Excess or obsolete inventory, the need to acquire increasing amounts of inventory due to shortages, customer demand or otherwise, or other failures to manage our working capital, could adversely affect our operating results, including our return on invested capital. 
 
 In addition, we provide managed inventory programs for some of our customers under which we hold and manage finished goods or work-in-process inventories. These managed inventory programs may result in higher inventory levels, further reduce our inventory turns and increase our financial exposure with such customers. In addition, our inventory may be held at a customer s facility or warehouse, or elsewhere in a location outside of our control, which may increase the risk of loss. Even though our customers generally have contractual obligations to purchase such inventories from us, we remain subject to customers credit risks as well as the risk of potential customer default and the need to enforce those obligations. 
 
 An inability to successfully manage the procurement, development, implementation or execution of information systems, or to adequately maintain these systems and their security, as well as to protect data and other confidential information, may adversely affect our business and reputation. 
 
 As a global company with a complex business model, we are heavily dependent on our information systems to support our customers requirements and to successfully manage our business. Any inability to successfully manage the procurement, development, implementation, execution or maintenance of our information systems, including matters related to system and data security, cybersecurity, privacy, reliability, compliance, performance and access, as well as any inability of these systems to fulfill their intended purpose within our business, could have an adverse effect on our business. 
 
 In the ordinary course of business, we collect and store sensitive data and information, including our proprietary and regulated business information and that of our customers, suppliers and business partners, as well as personally identifiable information about our employees. Our information systems, like those of other companies, are susceptible to malicious damage, intrusions and outages due to, among other events, viruses, cyber threats, industrial espionage (internal or external), hacking, break-ins and similar events, other breaches of security, natural disasters, power loss or telecommunications failures. Due to the intellectual property we maintain on our systems related to high technology components, sub-components, manufacturing processes and our customers products, we are a likely target from various external and internal cyber threats, such as lone attackers, competitors, our customers competitors and nation states seeking to gain access to such intellectual property, as well as both unintentional and malicious internal threats. In addition, lone and organized crime elements have been known to extort money by encrypting their victims data (ransomware) and utilize their victims resources for unauthorized mining of cryptocurrency. 
 
 The increasing sophistication of cyberattacks requires us to continually evaluate the threat landscape and new technologies and processes intended to detect and prevent these attacks. There can be no assurance that the security measures and systems configurations we choose to implement will be sufficient to protect the data we manage. Any theft or misuse of information resulting from a security breach could result in, among other things, loss of significant and/or sensitive information, litigation by affected parties, financial obligations resulting from such theft or misuse, higher insurance premiums, governmental investigations, fines and penalties, negative reactions from current and potential future customers, and reputational damage, any of which could adversely affect our financial results. Also, the time and funds spent on monitoring and mitigating our exposure and responding to breaches, including the training of employees, the purchase of protective technologies and the hiring of additional employees and consultants to assist in these efforts could adversely affect our financial results. This risk is enhanced as a result of an increase in our remote workforce due to the global pandemic and evolving flexible workplace practices, for example by reason of utilizing home networks that may lack encryption or secure password protection, virtual meeting/conference security concerns and increase of phishing/cyber-attacks around our remote workforce's digital resources.

 Moreover, we are subject to increasing expectations an d data security requirements from our customers, generally, as well as specific data handling requirements due to the nature of their end products, including those related to the Export Administration Regulations/International Traffic in Arms, Federal Acquisition Regulation, Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification . Any operational failure or breach of security from increasingly sophisticated cyber threats could lead to the loss or disclosure of our or our customers financial, product or other confidential information, result in adverse regulatory or other legal actions and have a material adverse effect on our business and reputation. In addition, we must comply with increasingly complex and rigorous regulatory standards enacted to protect business and personal data in the U.S. and elsewhere. For example, the European Union s General Data Protection Regulation (the GDPR and similar legislation in jurisdictions in which we operate impose additional obligations on companies regarding the handling of personal data and provides certain individual privacy rights to persons whose data is stored. Compliance with existing, proposed and recently enacted laws and regulations can be costly. Failure to comply with these regulatory standards could subject us to legal and reputational risks. Misuse of or failure to secure personal information could also result in violation of data privacy laws and regulations, proceedings against us by governmental entities or others, fines and penalties, damage to our reputation and credibility and could have a negative impact on our business and results of operations. 
 
 Plexus is a multinational corporation and operating in multiple countries exposes us to increased risks, including adverse local developments and currency risks. 
 
 We have operations in many countries; operations outside of the U.S. in the aggregate represent a majority of our net sales and operating income, with a particular concentration in Malaysia. In addition, although we have repatriated a substantial amount of cash since the enactment of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act U.S. Tax Reform in 2017, a significant amount of our cash balances remain held outside of the U.S., with a particular concentration in Malaysia and China. We purchase a significant number of components manufactured in various countries. These international aspects of our operations, which are likely to increase over time, including with the introduction of a new manufacturing facility in Bangkok, Thailand, subject us to the following risks that could materially impact our operations and operating results: 
 
 economic, political or civil instability 
 transportation delays or interruptions 
 exchange rate fluctuations 
 potential disruptions or restrictions on our ability to access cash amounts held outside of the U.S. 
 changes in labor markets, such as government-mandated wage increases, increases to minimum wage requirements, changes in union-related laws and regulations, limitations on immigration or the free movement of labor or restrictions on the use of migrant workers, and difficulties in appropriately staffing and managing personnel in diverse cultures 
 compliance with laws, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act and GDPR, applicable to companies with global operations 
 changes in the taxation of earnings both in the U.S. and in other countries 
 reputational risks related to, among other factors, varying standards and practices among countries 
 changes in duty rates 
 significant natural disasters and other events or factors impacting local infrastructure 
 the impact of the United Kingdom s exit from the European Union Brexit 
 the effects of other international political developments, such as tariffs, embargoes, sanctions, boycotts, trade wars, energy disruptions, trade agreements and changes in trade policies, including those which may be effected by the U.S. and other countries political reactions to those actions, and 
 regulatory requirements and potential changes to those requirements. 
 
 As our international operations continue to expand, our failure to appropriately address foreign currency transactions or the currency exposures associated with assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies could adversely affect our consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, developments affecting particular countries can adversely affect our ability to access cash or other assets held in such countries. 
 
 A significant portion of our operations currently occurs in the APAC region, particularly in Malaysia. The concentration of our operations, assets and profitability in that region exposes us to adverse developments, economic, political or otherwise, in those countries. 
 
 Changes in policies by or changes in elected officials of the U.S. or other governments could negatively affect our operating results due to trade wars, changes in duties, tariffs or taxes, currency exchange rate fluctuations, or limitations on currency or fund transfers, as well as government-imposed restrictions on producing certain products in, or shipping them to, specific countries. The United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (the "USMCA"), became effective July 1, 2020. While certain aspects of the USMCA may be positive, others, including potentially higher regulatory compliance costs, may have a negative impact 
 16

 on our business and adversely affect our operations in Mexico. Also, our current facilities in Mexico operate under the Mexican Maquiladora IMMEX program. This program provides for reduced tariffs and eased import regulations. We could be adversely affected by changes in the IMMEX program or our failure to comply with its requirements. 
 
 Additionally, continued uncertainty regarding commercial dealings, tariffs and other trade protection measures between the U.S. and China may affect our ability to do business in China, may impact the cost of our products originating in China and may impact the demand for our products manufactured in China in the event our customers reduce their operations in China. These actions could also affect the cost and/or availability of components that we procure from suppliers in China. Government-imposed restrictions on where we can produce certain types of products or source components or with whom we can conduct business, such as named companies or industries identified in the 2021 National Defense Authorization Act, could limit our ability to sell or manufacture products or services in China, or source components from certain companies or geographies. These factors can negatively affect our revenues, costs and profitability as a result of having to minimize engagements in China or requiring us to shift such production or the sourcing of components to the U.S. or other higher-cost locations. 
 
 Given the lack of comparable precedent, the financial, trade and other legal implications of Brexit, or how such implications might affect us (as we also have operations in Scotland), remain unclear. Brexit could, among other impacts, disrupt trade and the movement of goods, services and people between the U.K. and the E.U. or other countries, disrupt the stability of the E.U. generally and lead to a downturn in consumer sentiment. This could result in overall negative economic growth, as well as create legal, political, regulatory and global economic uncertainty. These and other potential implications could adversely affect our business and financial results. 
 
 Natural disasters, breaches of security and other events outside our control, and the ineffective management of such events, may harm our business. 
 
 Some of our facilities are located in areas that may be impacted by natural disasters, including tornadoes, hurricanes, earthquakes, water shortages, tsunamis and floods. All facilities are subject to other natural or man-made disasters such as those related to weather events or global climate change, fires, acts of terrorism or war, breaches of security, theft or espionage, workplace violence and failures of utilities. If such an event was to occur and we did not have an effective business continuity plan in place, our business could be harmed due to the event itself or due to our inability to effectively manage the effects of the particular event, with the impact of the event potentially magnified in areas where we have multiple facilities in close proximity. For example, we maintain significant production capacity in Penang, Malaysia, and an isolated event in that geography could materially hinder our production capabilities. Potential harms include the loss of business continuity, the loss of business data and damage to infrastructure. 
 
 In addition, some of our facilities possess certifications necessary to work on specialized products that our other locations lack. If work is disrupted at one of these facilities, it may be impractical or we may be unable to transfer such specialized work to another facility without significant costs and delays. Thus, any disruption in operations at a facility possessing specialized certifications could adversely affect our ability to provide products and services to our customers, and potentially have a negative affect our relationships and financial results. 
 
 Although we have implemented policies and procedures with respect to physical security, we remain at risk of unauthorized access to our facilities and the possible unauthorized use or theft of inventory, information or other physical assets. If unauthorized persons gain physical access to our facilities, or our physical assets or information are stolen, damaged or used in an unauthorized manner (whether through outside theft or industrial espionage), we could be subject to, among other consequences, negative publicity, governmental inquiry and oversight, loss of government contracts, litigation by affected parties or other future financial obligations related to the loss, misuse or theft of our or our customers data, inventory or physical assets, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our reputation and results of operations. 
 
 A failure to comply with customer-driven policies and standards, and third-party certification requirements or standards could adversely affect our business and reputation. 
 
 In addition to government regulations and industry standards, our customers may require us to comply with their own or third-party quality standards, commercial terms, or other business policies or standards, which may be more restrictive than current laws and regulations as well as our pre-existing policies and/or terms with our suppliers, before they commence, or continue, doing business with us. Such policies or standards may be customer-driven, established by the industry sectors in which we operate or imposed by third party organizations. 
 
 17 

Table of Contents 

 Our compliance with these heightened and/or additional policies, standards and third-party certification requirements, and managing a supply chain in accordance therewith, could be costly, and our failure to comply could adversely affect our operations, customer relationships, reputation and profitability. In addition, our adoption of these standards could adversely affect our cost competitiveness, ability to provide customers with required service levels and ability to attract and retain employees in jurisdictions where these standards vary from prevailing local customs and practices. In certain circumstances, to meet the requirements or standards of our customers we may be obligated to select certain suppliers or make other sourcing choices, and we may bear responsibility for adverse outcomes even if these matters are as the result of third-party actions or outside of our control. 
 
 Intellectual property infringement claims against our customers or us could harm our business. 
 
 Although our manufacturing processes are generally not subject to significant proprietary protection, our services may and the products offered by our customers do involve the creation and use of intellectual property rights, which subject us and our customers to the risk of claims of intellectual property infringement from third parties. In addition, our customers may require that we indemnify them against the risk of intellectual property infringement. If any claims are brought against us or our customers for infringement, whether or not these have merit, then we could be required to expend significant resources in defense of those claims. In the event of an infringement claim, we may be required to spend a significant amount of money to develop non-infringing alternatives or obtain licenses. We may not be successful in developing alternatives or obtaining licenses on reasonable terms or at all. Infringement by our customers could cause them to discontinue production of some of their products, potentially with little or no notice, which may reduce our net sales to them and disrupt our production. 
 
 Additionally, if third parties on whom we rely for products or services, such as component suppliers, are responsible for an infringement (including through the supply of counterfeit parts), we may or may not be able to hold them responsible and we may incur costs in defending claims or providing remedies. Such infringements may also cause our customers to abruptly discontinue selling the impacted products, which would adversely affect our net sales of those products and could affect our customer relationships more broadly. Similarly, claims affecting our suppliers could cause those suppliers to discontinue selling materials and components upon which we rely. 
 
 Risks impacting our PASSION MEETS PURPOSE We are united as a team. We are guided by our values and leadership behaviors. We do the right thing to support our team members, communities and customers. 

We depend on our workforce, and the inability to attract, develop and retain personnel or other personnel disruptions may harm our business. 
 
 If we fail to attract, develop and retain sufficient qualified personnel, including key leadership positions and highly skilled technical roles, our operations and, consequently, our financial results, could be adversely affected. A number of factors may adversely affect labor availability in one or more of our locations, including local labor laws and practices or union activities, wage pressure and changing wage requirements, increasing healthcare costs, restrictions on immigration or labor mobility, local competition, high employment rates and high turnover rates. These labor-related issues and labor shortages have become more pronounced likely as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak. We could also be subject to inflationary or other general labor cost increases due to current economic condition, which may increase our costs. If we are unable to offset these labor costs increases through price increases, growth or operational efficiencies, these inflationary or general labor cost increases could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and cash flows. Further, our adoption of certain third-party health, safety and other employment-related regulatory standards could adversely affect our ability to attract and retain employees in jurisdictions where these standards vary from prevailing local customs and practices. Additionally, any of these factors could drive an increase in turnover rates within our existing workforce, which could lead to decreased efficiency and increased costs, such as increased over time to meet demand and increased wage rates to attract and retain employees. 
 
 We also depend on good relationships with our workforce, generally. Monitoring employee engagement and maintaining a healthy workplace culture based on our values and leadership behaviors is important to developing these good relationships and retaining a committed workforce. A failure to foster a strong, healthy culture, or a failure to adopt or maintain competitive policies and practices that enhance our workplace culture, such as those related to diversity and inclusion, workplace flexibility or other employee benefits, could adversely impact our ability to attract, develop and retain personnel and could substantially affect our operations and financial results. 
 
 From time to time, there are changes and developments, such as retirements, promotions, transitions, disability, death and other terminations of service that affect our executive officers and other key employees, including those that are unexpected. Transitions or other changes in responsibilities among officers and key employees without having identified and ready 
 18 

Table of Contents 

 successors for these critical roles, particularly when such changes are unanticipated, unplanned or not executed effectively, inherently can cause disruptions to our business and operations, as well as harm our reputation, which could have an effect on our results. Further, as we grow in size and complexity, a failure to continuously focus on the development of personnel and plan for the succession of critical roles may result in shortfalls in the talent required to execute effectively and affect our operations and financial results. 
 
 Global climate change and related emphasis on environmental, social and governance ("ESG") matters by various stakeholders could negatively affect our business. 
 
 Customer, investor and employee expectations relating to ESG have been rapidly evolving and increasing. In addition, government organizations are enhancing or advancing legal and regulatory requirements specific to ESG matters. The heightened stakeholder focus on ESG issues related to our business requires the continuous monitoring of various and evolving laws, regulations, standards and expectations and the associated reporting requirements. A failure to adequately meet stakeholder expectations may result in noncompliance, the loss of business, reputational impacts, diluted market valuation, an inability to attract customers and an inability to attract and retain top talent. In addition, our adoption of certain standards or mandated compliance to certain requirements could necessitate additional investments that could impact our profitability. 
 
 Specifically, certain stakeholders are beginning to require that we provide information on our plans relating to certain climate-related matters such as greenhouse gas emissions. Further, increased public awareness and concern regarding global climate change may result in new or enhanced legal requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of greenhouse gas emissions. There continues to be a lack of consistent climate legislation, which creates economic and regulatory uncertainty. Such uncertainty may have an impact on our business, from the demand for our customers products in various industries to our costs of compliance in the manufacturing and servicing of our customers products, all of which may impact our results of operations. 
 
 Climate changes, such as extreme weather conditions, create financial risk to our business. Global physical climate changes, including unseasonable weather conditions, could result in reduced demand or product obsolescence for certain of our customers products and/or price modifications for our customers products and the resources needed to produce them. This could in turn put pressure on our manufacturing costs and result in reduced profit margin associated with certain of our customer programs, or loss of customer programs that we may not be able to replace. 
 
 Climate changes could also disrupt our operations by impacting the availability and cost of materials within our supply chain, and could also increase insurance and other operating costs. These factors may impact our decisions to construct new facilities or maintain existing facilities in areas most prone to physical climate risks, such as our facilities in Malaysia at or near sea level. 
 
 Risks impacting our DISCIPLINE BY DESIGN We hold ourselves accountable to delivering shareholder value through consistent application of a disciplined financial model . 

Our financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected by the ongoing coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak. 
 
 The full extent to which the COVID-19 outbreak will impact our business and operating results will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be accurately predicted, including new medical and other information that may emerge concerning COVID-19 and the actions by governmental entities or others to contain it or treat its impact. 
 
 The continuing COVID-19 outbreak, including the spread of its variants, poses the risk that we or our employees, suppliers, customers and others may be restricted or prevented from conducting business activities for indefinite or intermittent periods of time, including as a result of employee health and safety concerns, shutdowns, shelter in place orders, travel restrictions and other actions and restrictions that may be prudent or required by governmental authorities. For example, in fiscal 2021, our operations across the globe were impacted at various times due to quarantines, travel restrictions, government-mandated workforce limitations and other factors affecting us and our suppliers. In addition, we experienced a temporary reduction of our operating capacity in Malaysia during our third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2021 as a result of government-mandated actions to control the spread of COVID-19. Finally, while our facilities, and those of some of our suppliers, have been classified as essential or otherwise permitted to operate in jurisdictions in which facility closures have been mandated, we can give no assurance that this will not change in the future or that we or our suppliers will continue to be permitted to conduct business in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate.

Table of Contents 

 In addition to government-imposed shutdowns or restrictions on our business activities due to COVID-19, governments may impose vaccine or testing requirements on some or all of our employees. On September 9, 2021, President Biden issued an executive order which requires U.S-based contractors and subcontractors that work on or in support of contracts with the U.S. Government be fully vaccinated unless otherwise exempt for approved medical or religious exemptions. Further, on September 9, 2021, President Biden instructed the Occupational Safety and Health Administration ("OSHA") to develop an Emergency Temporary Standard ("ETS") mandating either full vaccination or weekly testing of employees for employers with more than 100 employees. The ETS on vaccination and testing was officially filed in the Office of the Federal Register on November 4, 2021, and became effective when published on November 5, 2021. We have been assessing the applicability of these executive actions to our business and are taking steps to prepare to comply, as required. Other jurisdictions in which we operate may also mandate vaccinations or testing. Implementation of mandatory vaccinations or weekly testing requirements may result in increased costs of compliance, labor attrition, including critically skilled labor, difficulty attracting and retaining future employees and loss of revenues associated with U.S. government contracts or subcontracts, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 We also have modified our business practices for the continued health and safety of our employees. We may take further actions, or be required to take further actions, that are in the best interests of our employees. Our suppliers and customers have also implemented such measures, which has resulted in, and we expect it will continue to result in, disruptions or delays and higher costs. The implementation of health and safety practices by us, our suppliers, or our customers could impact customer demand, supplier deliveries, our productivity and costs, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. 
 
 While we currently believe we have ample liquidity to manage the financial impact of COVID-19, we can give no assurance that this will continue to be the case if the impact of COVID-19 is prolonged or if there is an extended impact on us or the economy generally. Further, the impacts of COVID-19 have caused significant uncertainty and volatility in the credit markets. If our liquidity or access to capital becomes significantly constrained, or if costs of capital increase significantly due to the impact of COVID-19 as result of volatility in the capital markets, a reduction in our creditworthiness or other factors, then our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected. 
 
 Our management of the impact of COVID-19 has and will continue to require significant investment of time from our management and employees, as well as resources across our enterprise. The focus on managing and mitigating the impacts of COVID-19 on our business may cause us to divert or delay the application of our resources toward existing or new initiatives or investments, which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. 
 
 The foregoing and other continued disruptions to our business as a result of COVID-19 has had and could continue to have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
 
 Challenges associated with the engagement of new customers or programs, the provision of new services, or start-up costs and inefficiencies related to new, recent or transferred programs could affect our operations and financial results. 
 
 Our engagement with new customers, as well as the addition of new programs or types of services for existing customers, can present challenges in addition to opportunities. We must initially determine whether it would be in our interests from a business perspective to pursue a particular potential new customer, program or service, including evaluating whether the customer, program or service fits with our value proposition as well as its potential end-market success. If we make the decision to proceed, we need to ensure that our terms of engagement, including our pricing and other contractual provisions, appropriately reflect the strategic nature of the customer, anticipated costs, risks and rewards. The failure to make prudent engagement decisions or to establish appropriate terms of engagement could adversely affect our profitability and margins. 
 
 Also, there are inherent risks associated with the timing and ultimate realization of anticipated revenue from a new program or service; these factors can sometimes extend for a significant period. Some new programs or services require us to devote significant capital and personnel resources to new technologies and competencies. We may not meet customer expectations, which could damage our relationships with the affected customers and impact our ability to deliver conforming product or services on a timely basis. Further, the success of new programs may depend heavily on factors such as product reliability, market acceptance, regulatory approvals or economic conditions. The failure of a new program to meet expectations on these factors, or our inability to effectively execute on a new program s or service s requirements, could result in lost financial opportunities and adversely affect our results of operations. 
 
 In recent years, ramping new programs has been a key contributor to our revenue growth. The management of resources in connection with the establishment of new or recent programs and customer relationships, as well as program transfers between facilities and geographies, and the need to estimate required resources in advance of production can adversely affect our gross 
 20 

Table of Contents 

 and operating margins and level of working capital. These factors are particularly evident in the early stages of the life-cycle of new programs, which typically lack a track record of order volume and timing as well as production efficiencies in the early stages. We typically manage multiple new programs at any given time; therefore, we are exposed to these factors in varying magnitudes. 
 
 The effects of these start-up costs and inefficiencies can also occur when we transfer programs between locations and geographies. We conduct these transfers on a regular basis to meet customer needs, seek long-term efficiencies or respond to market conditions, as well as due to facility openings and closures. We may also be required to transfer projects between facilities due to tariffs and other trade measures impacting particular countries such as China. Although we try to recover costs from our customers and minimize the potential losses arising from transitioning customer programs between our facilities and geographies, we may not be successful and there are inherent risks that such transitions can result in operational inefficiencies and the disruption of programs and customer relationships. 
 
 While these factors tend to affect new, recent or transferred programs, they can also impact more mature or maturing programs and customer relationships, especially programs where end-market demand can be somewhat volatile. 
 
 Failure to manage periods of growth or contraction may seriously harm our business. 
 
 Our industry frequently sees periods of expansion and contraction. We regularly contend with these issues and must carefully manage our business to meet changing customer and market requirements. If we fail to manage these growth and contraction decisions effectively, as well as fail to realize the anticipated benefits of these decisions, we can find ourselves with either excess or insufficient resources and our business, as well as our profitability, may suffer. Expansion and consolidation, including the transfer of operations to new or other facilities or due to acquisitions, can inherently include additional costs and start-up inefficiencies. For example, we are expanding our geographic locations and constructing a new manufacturing facility in Bangkok, Thailand, to supplement our footprint in the Asia-Pacific region. In addition, we may expand our operations in new geographical areas where currently we do not operate. If we are unable to effectively manage this or other expansions or consolidations, or related anticipated net sales are not realized, our operating results could be adversely affected. Other risks of current or future expansions, acquisitions and consolidations include: 
 
 the inability to successfully integrate additional facilities or incremental capacity and to realize anticipated efficiencies, economies of scale or other value 
 challenges faced as a result of transitioning programs 
 incurrence of restructuring costs or other charges that may be insufficient or may not have their intended effects 
 additional fixed or other costs, or selling and administrative expenses, which may not be fully absorbed by new business 
 a reduction of our return on invested capital, including as a result of excess inventory or excess capacity at new facilities, as well as the increased costs associated with opening new facilities 
 difficulties in the timing of expansions, including delays in the implementation of construction and manufacturing plans 
 diversion of management's attention from other business areas during the planning and implementation of expansions 
 strain placed on our operational, financial and other systems and resources, and 
 inability to locate sufficient customers, employees or management talent to support the expansion. 
 
 Periods of contraction or reduced net sales, or other factors affecting particular sites, create other challenges. We must determine whether facilities remain viable, whether staffing levels need to be reduced and how to respond to changing levels of customer demand. While maintaining excess capacity or higher levels of employment entail short-term costs, reductions in capacity or employment could impair our ability to respond to new opportunities and programs, market improvements or to maintain customer relationships. Our decisions to reduce costs and capacity can affect our short-term and long-term results. When we make decisions to reduce capacity or to close facilities, we frequently incur restructuring costs. 
 
 In addition, to meet our customers' needs, particularly when the production requirements of certain products are site-specific, to achieve increased efficiencies, or to address factors affecting specific locations, such as tariffs and trade disputes, we sometimes require additional capacity in one location while reducing capacity in another. Since customers needs and market conditions can vary and change rapidly, we may find ourselves in a situation where we simultaneously experience the effects of contraction in one location and expansion in another location. We may also encounter situations where our lack of a physical presence in certain locations may limit or foreclose opportunities.

 Changes in tax laws, potential tax disputes, negative or unforeseen tax consequences or further developments affecting our deferred tax assets could adversely affect our results. 
 
 Our effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic mix of earnings across the jurisdictions where we operate. Changes in tax laws or tax rates in those jurisdictions, including, but not limited to, as a result of actions by the U.S. (including additional guidance and interpretations related to U.S. Tax Reform or potential passage of tax regulation changes under the U.S. presidential administration) or other countries, could continue to have a material impact on our operating results. Among other things, we have been, and are expected to continue to be, affected by the global intangible low-taxed income provisions added by U.S. Tax Reform and related new tax legislation, interpretations and guidance. Our effective tax rate may also be impacted by tax holidays and other various tax credits granted by local taxing authorities. In addition, the implementation of U.S. Tax Reform has required the use of estimates, which may be refined in future periods. All incentives, including a tax holiday granted to our Malaysian subsidiary, are subject to certain terms and conditions. While we expect to comply with these conditions, we would experience adverse tax consequences if we are found to not be in compliance or if the terms and conditions of the tax holiday are unfavorably altered by the local taxing authorities, changes to U.S. tax policy or the establishment of a global minimum tax. 
 
 Our taxable income in any jurisdiction is dependent upon the local taxing authority s acceptance of our operational and intercompany transfer pricing practices as being at arm s length. Due to inconsistencies among jurisdictions in the application of the arm s length standard, our transfer pricing methods may be challenged and, if not upheld, could increase our income tax expense. Risks associated with transfer pricing adjustments are further highlighted by the global initiative from the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development called the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting BEPS project. The BEPS project is challenging longstanding international tax norms regarding the taxation of profits from cross-border business. Given the scope of our international operations and the fluid and uncertain nature of how the BEPS project might ultimately lead to future legislation, it is difficult to assess how any changes in tax laws would impact our income tax expense. 
 
 We review the probability of the realization of our net deferred tax assets each period based on forecasts of taxable income by jurisdiction. This review uses historical results, projected future operating results based upon approved business plans, eligible carryforward periods, tax planning opportunities and other relevant considerations. Adverse changes in the profitability and financial outlook in each of our jurisdictions may require the creation of an additional valuation allowance to reduce our net deferred tax assets. Such changes could result in material non-cash expenses in the period in which the changes are made. 
 
 We may fail to secure or maintain necessary additional financing or capital. 
 
 Although we have credit facilities, we cannot be certain that our existing credit arrangements will provide all of the financing capacity that we will need in the future or that we will be able to change the credit facilities or revise covenants, if necessary, to accommodate changes or developments in our business and operations and/or increased working capital needs. In addition, if we do not comply with the covenants under our credit facility, our ability to borrow under that facility would be adversely affected. In addition, it is possible that counterparties to our financial agreements, including our credit facility and receivables factoring programs, may not be willing or able to meet their obligations, either due to instability in the global financial markets or otherwise, which could, among other impacts, increase the duration of our cash collection cycle. While we currently believe we have ample liquidity to manage the financial impact of COVID-19, we can give no assurance that this will continue to be the case if the impact of COVID-19 is prolonged or if there is an extended impact on us or the economy in general. 
 
 Our future success may depend on our ability to obtain additional financing and capital to support possible future growth and future initiatives. In addition, we also have receivables factoring programs. Many of our borrowings are at variable interest rates and therefore our interest expense is subject to increase if rates increase. 
 
 We may seek to raise capital by issuing additional common stock, other equity securities or debt securities, modifying our existing credit facilities or obtaining new facilities, or through a combination of these methods. We may not be able to obtain capital when we want or need it, and capital may not be available on satisfactory terms. If we issue additional equity securities or convertible securities to raise capital, it may be dilutive to shareholders ownership interests; we may not be able to offer our securities on attractive or acceptable terms in the event of volatility or weakness in our stock price. Furthermore, any additional financing may have terms and conditions that adversely affect our business, such as restrictive financial or operating covenants, and our ability to meet any current or future financing covenants will largely depend on our financial performance, which in turn will be subject to general economic conditions and financial, business and other factors.

 The elimination of the London Interbank Offering Rate ("LIBOR") could adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. 
 
 Borrowings under our credit facilities use LIBOR as a benchmark for establishing the applicable interest rate. The U.K. s Financial Conduct Authority announced that after 2021 it would no longer persuade or compel panel banks to submit the rates required to calculate LIBOR. The consequences of these developments with respect to LIBOR cannot be entirely predicted but could result in an increase in the cost of our variable rate indebtedness causing a negative impact on our financial position, liquidity and results of operations. Specifically, the use of an alternative reference rate could result in increased costs, including increased interest expense on our borrowings, and increased borrowing costs in the future.

 The following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ("MD A") is intended to provide an analysis of both short-term results and future prospects from management s perspective, including an assessment of the financial condition and results of operations, events and uncertainties that are not indicative of future operations and any other financial or statistical data that we believe will enhance the understanding of our company s financial condition, cash flows and other changes in financial condition and results of operations. The information should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements included herein and "Risk Factors" included in Part I, Item 1A herein. 
 
 A discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 is presented below. A discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 can be found under Part II, Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations," in our Annual Report on the Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 3, 2020, which was filed with the SEC on November 20, 2020, and is available on the SEC s website at www.sec.gov as well as our Inventor Relations website at www.plexus.com. 
 COVID-19 Update 
 We continue to monitor the global outbreak and spread of COVID-19 and take steps to mitigate the potential risks to us posed by its spread and related circumstances and impacts. 
 
 The health and safety of our employees is a top priority for us. We have progressively implemented measures to safeguard our employees from the COVID-19 infection and exposure and have made significant efforts to mitigate the effects of regulatory authority restrictions on our operations through a combination of adjustments in our shift patterns, flexible work arrangements, productivity improvements, facility enhancements to support social distancing and optimizing employee capability to work from home, if needed. These efforts will continue as requirements change, new risks are identified and infections impact us. 
 
 We have experienced labor shortages due to COVID-19 quarantines or workforce curtailments, particularly in Malaysia during the latter half of fiscal 2021, as the virus spread. Due to high vaccination rates among our team in Malaysia recently achieved, we do not expect the labor challenges in the region to persist. However, the spread and resurgence of the COVID-19 virus in other jurisdictions we operate may make our ability to mitigate the impacts of the pandemic on our productivity more challenging. 
 
 We remain in close contact with our suppliers to understand the impacts of COVID-19 on their businesses and operations. Our suppliers may face challenges in maintaining an adequate workforce or securing materials from their own suppliers as a result of COVID-19. We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience in fiscal 2022, an inability to procure certain components and materials on a timely basis due to worsening supply chain shortages likely as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. We continue to take steps to validate our suppliers ability to deliver to us on time, but anticipate that the extended lead times will require us to make additional investments in inventory to satisfy customer demand. 
 
 The combination of labor reductions, particularly in Malaysia, and worsening supply chain constraints has impacted our ability to meet customer demand, and as a result, negatively impacted revenue compared to expectations. The global supply chain constraints will limit our ability to capture the robust demand from our customers entering fiscal 2022. We continue to maintain additional resources to help mitigate component constraint challenges and the operating inefficiencies COVID-19 has created, but note these inefficiencies place additional burden on operating results. 
 
 The global supply chain constraints have led to inflation in many of the components we acquire, as well as labor and operating costs. While we have been largely able to mitigate the impacts of inflation through our contractual rights with customers on 
 27 

Table of Contents 

 pricing, the inability to offset these costs in future periods or the impacts of continued inflation on end markets and our customers may affect our operating results. 
 
 We believe we are positioned with a strong balance sheet. As of the end of fiscal 2021, cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash were 271 million, while debt, finance lease obligations and other financing were 253 million. Borrowings under our Credit Facility as of October 2, 2021 were 55 million, leaving 295 million of our revolving commitment of 350 million available for use as of October 2, 2021. Refer to Note 4, "Debt, Finance Lease Obligations and Other Financing," in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and "Management s Discussion and Analysis Liquidity and Capital Resources" in Part II, Item 7 for further information. 

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 Consolidated Performance Summary. The following table presents selected consolidated financial data for the indicated fiscal years (dollars in millions, except per share data): 
 2021 2020 Net sales 3,368.9 3,390.4 Cost of sales 3,045.6 3,077.7 Gross profit 323.3 312.7 Gross margin 9.6 9.2 Operating income 176.3 153.4 Operating margin 5.2 4.5 Other expense 15.9 18.0 Income tax expense 21.5 17.9 Net income 138.9 117.5 Diluted earnings per share 4.76 3.93 Return on invested capital 15.4 14.0 Economic return 7.3 5.2 Non-GAAP metric; refer to "Return on Invested Capital ("ROIC") and economic return" below for more information and Exhibit 99.1 for a reconciliation. 
 Net sales. Fiscal 2021 net sales decreased 21.5 million, or 0.6 , as compared to fiscal 2020. 
 Net sales are analyzed by management by geographic segment, which reflects our reportable segments, and by market sector. Management measures operational performance and allocates resources on a geographic segment basis. Our global business development strategy is based on our targeted market sectors. Beginning in fiscal 2021, we consolidated the previously reported Industrial/Commercial and Communications market sectors to form the Industrial market sector. Prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. 
 As a percentage of consolidated net sales, net sales attributable to customers representing 10 or more of consolidated net sales as well as the percentage of net sales attributable to our ten largest customers for the indicated fiscal years were as follows: 
 2021 2020 General Electric Company ("GE") 11.2 11.7 Top 10 customers 55.2 55.2

Table of Contents 

 A discussion of net sales by reportable segment is presented below for the indicated fiscal years (in millions): 
 2021 2020 Net sales: AMER 1,317.4 1,327.8 APAC 1,850.6 1,824.8 EMEA 312.7 349.1 Elimination of inter-segment sales (111.8) (111.3) Total net sales 3,368.9 3,390.4 
 AMER. Net sales for fiscal 2021 in the AMER segment decreased 10.4 million, or 0.8 , as compared to fiscal 2020. The decrease in net sales was driven by overall net decreased customer end-market demand, primarily within the Healthcare/Life Sciences sector and with commercial aerospace customers in the Aerospace/Defense sector likely as a result of COVID-19. The decrease was also driven by a reduction in net sales of 12.6 million due to disengagements with customers and a 14.1 million decrease for end-of-life products. These decreases were partially offset by a 72.9 million increase in production ramps for new customers, partially inclusive of increased demand likely as a result of COVID-19, and a 30.4 million increase in production ramps of new products for existing customers. 
 APAC. Net sales for fiscal 2021 in the APAC segment increased 25.8 million, or 1.4 , as compared to fiscal 2020. The increase in net sales was driven by a 19.5 million increase in production ramps of new products for existing customers and overall net increased customer end-market demand, partially inclusive of decreased demand likely as a result of COVID-19. These increases were partially offset by a 6.0 million decrease in the partial loss of a program with an existing customer, a 5.4 million decrease for an end-of-life product as well as reduced operating capacity due to mandated workforce curtailments for manufacturers in certain parts of the region. 
 EMEA. Net sales for fiscal 2021 in the EMEA segment decreased 36.4 million, or 10.4 , as compared to fiscal 2020. The decrease in net sales was driven by overall net decreased customer end-market demand, inclusive of decreased demand likely as a result of COVID-19, and a 14.0 million decrease for an end-of-life product likely as a result of COVID-19. 
 Our net sales by market sector for the indicated fiscal years were as follows (in millions): 
 2021 2020 Net sales: Industrial 1,549.0 1,520.4 Healthcare/Life Sciences 1,326.9 1,258.4 Aerospace/Defense 493.0 611.6 Total net sales 3,368.9 3,390.4 
 Industrial. Net sales for fiscal 2021 in the Industrial sector increased 28.6 million, or 1.9 , as compared to fiscal 2020. The increase was driven by overall net increased customer end-market demand, a 23.8 million increase in production ramps for new customers and a 6.6 million increase in production ramps of new products for existing customers. The increase was partially offset by a decrease of 16.1 million due to disengagements with customers, a 5.4 million decrease for end-of-life products as well as reduced operating capacity due to mandated workforce curtailments for manufacturers in certain parts of the APAC region. 
 Healthcare/Life Sciences . Net sales for fiscal 2021 in the Healthcare/Life Sciences sector increased 68.5 million, or 5.4 , as compared to fiscal 2020. The increase in net sales was driven by a 40.2 million increase in production ramps of new products for existing customers. The increase was also due to a 37.8 million increase in production ramps for a new customer and overall net increased customer end-market demand, both inclusive of increased demand likely as a result of COVID-19. The increase was partially offset by a 28.1 million decrease for end-of-life products, partially as a result decreased demand in critical care products likely due to COVID-19, a 6.0 million decrease due to the partial loss of a program with an existing customer as well as reduced operating capacity due to mandated workforce curtailments for manufacturers in certain parts of the APAC region. 
 Aerospace/Defense . Net sales for fiscal 2021 in the Aerospace/Defense sector decreased 118.6 million, or 19.4 , as compared to fiscal 2020. The decrease was driven by net decreased customer end-market demand, primarily with commercial aerospace customers likely due to COVID-19. The decrease was partially offset by a 20.0 million increase in production ramps for new customers.

Table of Contents 

 Cost of sales. Cost of sales for fiscal 2021 decreased 32.1 million, or 1.0 , as compared to fiscal 2020. Cost of sales is comprised primarily of material and component costs, labor costs and overhead. In fiscal 2021 and 2020, approximately 89 of the total cost of sales was variable in nature and fluctuated with sales volumes. Approximately 88 of these costs in fiscal 2021 and 87 of these costs in 2020 were related to material and component costs. 
 As compared to fiscal 2020, the decrease in cost of sales in fiscal 2021 was primarily driven by the decrease in net sales, favorable customer mix and decreased costs associated with COVID-19. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in fixed costs. 
 Gross profit. Gross profit for fiscal 2021 increased 10.6 million, or 3.4 , as compared to fiscal 2020. Gross margin of 9.6 increased 40 basis points compared to fiscal 2020. The primary driver of the increase in gross profit and gross margin as compared to fiscal 2020 was the favorable customer mix as well as decreased employee compensation and supplies costs associated with COVID-19. This was partially offset by the decrease in net sales and an increase in fixed costs. 
 Operating income. Operating income for fiscal 2021 increased 22.9 million, or 14.9 , as compared to fiscal 2020 as a result of the increase in gross profit, a 9.6 million decrease in selling and administrative expenses ("S A") and a 2.7 million decrease in restructuring and impairment charges. The decrease in S A was primarily due to a decrease in bad debt expense and a decrease in incentive compensation expenses. Operating margin of 5.2 increased 70 basis points compared to fiscal 2020, primarily due to the increase in gross margin and reduction of S A as a result of factors previously discussed. 
 A discussion of operating income by reportable segment for the indicated fiscal years is presented below (in millions): 
 2021 2020 Operating income (loss): AMER 62.3 38.1 APAC 238.8 246.6 EMEA (0.9) 1.5 Corporate and other costs (123.9) (132.8) Total operating income 176.3 153.4 
 AMER. Operating income increased 24.2 million in fiscal 2021 as compared to fiscal 2020, primarily as a result of a positive shift in customer mix, improvements in labor productivity, reduced fixed costs and decreased costs associated with COVID-19. In addition, there was a decrease in S A primarily due to a decrease in bad debt expense. This was partially offset by a decrease in net sales. 
 APAC. Operating income decreased 7.8 million in fiscal 2021 as compared to fiscal 2020, primarily as a result of reductions in labor productivity, an increase in fixed costs to support new program ramps and a negative shift in customer mix. This was partially offset by an increase in net sales and a decrease in S A. 
 EMEA. Operating income decreased 2.4 million in fiscal 2021 as compared to fiscal 2020 primarily as a result of decreased net sales, a decrease in labor productivity and an increase in S A. This was partially offset by a positive shift in customer mix. 
 Other expense. Other expense for fiscal 2021 decreased 2.1 million as compared to fiscal 2020. The decrease in other expense for fiscal 2021 was primarily due to the decrease in interest expense of 1.9 million and factoring fees of 1.2 million. The decrease was partially offset by an increase of 0.6 million in foreign exchange losses as well as a decrease of 0.5 million in interest income. 
 Income taxes. Income tax expense for fiscal 2021 was 21.5 million compared to 17.9 million for fiscal 2020. The increase is primarily due to the geographic distribution of worldwide earnings and an increase in pre-tax income. 
 Our annual effective tax rate varies from the U.S. statutory rate of 21.0 primarily due to the geographic distribution of worldwide earnings as well as a tax holiday granted to a subsidiary located in the APAC segment where we derive a significant portion of our earnings. Our effective tax rate may also be impacted by disputes with taxing authorities, tax planning activities, adjustments to uncertain tax positions and changes in valuation allowances. 
 We have been granted a tax holiday for a foreign subsidiary operating in the APAC segment. This tax holiday will expire on December 31, 2034, and is subject to certain conditions with which we expect to continue to comply. In fiscal 2021 and 2020, the holiday resulted in tax reductions, net of the impact of the global intangible low-taxed income ("GILTI") provisions of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ("U.S. Tax Reform"), of approximately 34.4 million 1.20 per basic share, 1.18 per diluted share) and 28.3 million 0.97 per basic share, 0.95 per diluted share), respectively. 
 30 

Table of Contents 

 See also Note 6, "Income Taxes," in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our tax rate. 
 The annual effective tax rate for fiscal 2022 is expected to be approximately 13.0 to 15.0 assuming no changes to tax laws. 
 Net Income. Net income for fiscal 2021 increased 21.4 million, or 18.2 , from fiscal 2020 to 138.9 million. Net income increased primarily as a result of the increase in operating income, partially offset by the increase in tax expense as previously discussed. 
 Diluted earnings per share. Diluted earnings per share increased to 4.76 in fiscal 2021 from 3.93 in fiscal 2020 primarily as a result of increased net income due to the factors discussed above and a reduction in diluted shares outstanding due to repurchase activity under our share repurchase plans. 
 Return on Invested Capital ("ROIC") and economic return. We use a financial model that is aligned with our business strategy and includes a ROIC goal of 500 basis points over our weighted average cost of capital ("WACC"), which we refer to as "economic return." 
 Non-GAAP financial measures, including ROIC and economic return, are used for internal management goals and decision making because such measures provide management and investors additional insight into financial performance. In particular, we provide ROIC and economic return because we believe they offer insight into the metrics that are driving management decisions because we view ROIC and economic return as important measures in evaluating the efficiency and effectiveness of our long-term capital requirements. We also use ROIC as a performance criteria in determining certain elements of compensation and certain compensation incentives are based on economic return performance. 
 We define ROIC as tax-effected operating income before restructuring and other special items divided by average invested capital over a rolling five-quarter period for the fiscal year. Invested capital is defined as equity plus debt and operating lease liabilities, less cash and cash equivalents. Other companies may not define or calculate ROIC in the same way. ROIC and other non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, measures of our financial performance prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). 
 We review our internal calculation of WACC annually. Our WACC was 8.1 for fiscal 2021 and 8.8 for fiscal 2020. By exercising discipline to generate ROIC in excess of our WACC, our goal is to create value for our shareholders. Fiscal 2021 ROIC of 15.4 reflects an economic return of 7.3 , based on our weighted average cost of capital of 8.1 , and fiscal 2020 ROIC of 14.0 reflects an economic return of 5.2 , based on our weighted average cost of capital of 8.8 for that fiscal year. 
 For a reconciliation of ROIC, economic return and adjusted operating income (tax effected) to our financial statements that were prepared using GAAP, see Exhibit 99.1 to this annual report on Form 10-K, which exhibit is incorporated herein by reference. 
 Refer to the table below, which includes the calculation of ROIC and economic return for the indicated fiscal years (dollars in millions): 
 2021 2020 Adjusted operating income (tax effected) 156.2 137.1 Average invested capital 1,014.7 980.0 After-tax ROIC 15.4 14.0 WACC 8.1 8.8 Economic return 7.3 5.2 

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 Cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash were 270.5 million as of October 2, 2021, as compared to 387.9 million as of October 3, 2020. 
 As of October 2, 2021, 88 of our cash and cash equivalents balance was held outside of the U.S. by our foreign subsidiaries. With the enactment of U.S. Tax Reform, we believe that our offshore cash can be accessed in a more tax efficient manner than before U.S. Tax Reform. Currently, we believe that our cash balance, together with cash available under our Credit Facility, 
 31 

Table of Contents 

 will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs and potential share repurchases, if any, for the next twelve months and for the foreseeable future. 
 Our future cash flows from operating activities will be reduced by 53.6 million due to cash payments for U.S. federal taxes on the deemed repatriation of undistributed foreign earnings that are payable over an eight year period that began in fiscal 2019 with the first payment. The table below provides the expected timing of these future cash outflows, in accordance with the following installment schedule for the remaining five years (in millions): 
 2022 5.6 2023 5.6 2024 10.6 2025 14.2 2026 17.6 Total 53.6 
 Cash Flows. The following table provides a summary of cash flows for fiscal 2021 and 2020 (in millions): 
 2021 2020 Cash provided by operating activities 142.6 210.4 Cash used in investing activities (57.0) (49.9) Cash used in financing activities (203.9) (1.5) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents 0.9 2.6 Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash (117.4) 161.6 
 
 Operating Activities. Cash flows provided by operating activities were 142.6 million for fiscal 2021, as compared to 210.4 million for fiscal 2020. The decrease was primarily due to cash flow (reductions) improvements of: 
 
 21.4 million increase in net income. 
 (150.1) million in inventory cash flows driven by increased inventory levels to support the ramp of customer programs and longer lead times for certain components as a result of supply chain constraints heightened by the COVID-19 outbreak. 
 (42.3) million in accounts receivable cash flows, which resulted from decreased factoring activity, the timing of customer shipments and payments as well as the mix of customer payment terms. 
 (29.4) million in other current and non-current asset cash flows, driven by an increase in prepaid expenses and miscellaneous receivables. 
 40.8 million in other current and non-current liabilities cash flows driven by an increase in advance payments from customers. 
 46.7 million in accounts payables cash flows driven by increased purchasing activity to support the ramp of customer programs and supply chain constraints to obtain certain components heightened by the COVID-19 outbreak. 
 25.5 million in customer deposit cash flows driven by significant deposits received from two customers in the current year to cover certain inventory balances, partially offset by three significant deposits received in the prior year. 
 21.1 million in contract assets cash flows, driven by consistent demand from customers who recognized revenue over time in the current year compared to growing demand in the prior year.

 The following table provides a summary of cash cycle days for the periods indicated (in days): 
 Three Months Ended October 2, 2021 October 3, 2020 Days in accounts receivable 56 48 Days in contract assets 13 11 Days in inventory 116 85 Days in accounts payable (76) (57) Days in cash deposits (24) (18) Annualized cash cycle 85 69 
 We calculate days in accounts receivable and contract assets as each balance sheet item for the respective quarter divided by annualized sales for the respective quarter by day. We calculate days in inventory, accounts payable and cash deposits as each balance sheet line item for the respective quarter divided by annualized cost of sales for the respective quarter by day. We calculate annualized cash cycle as the sum of days in accounts receivable, days in contract assets and days in inventory, less days in accounts payable and days in cash deposits. 
 As of October 2, 2021, annualized cash cycle days increased sixteen days compared to October 3, 2020 due to the following: 
 Days in accounts receivable for the three months ended October 2, 2021 increased eight days compared to the three months ended October 3, 2020. The increase is primarily attributable to the timing of customer shipments and payments, mix of customer payment terms and a decrease in factored receivables. 
 Days in contract assets for the three months ended October 2, 2021 increased two days compared to the three months ended October 3, 2020. The increase is primarily attributable to overall decreased net sales. 
 Days in inventory for the three months ended October 2, 2021 increased thirty-one days compared to the three months ended October 3, 2020. The increase is due to increased inventory levels to support the ramp of customer programs and longer lead times for certain components as a result of supply chain constraints heightened by the COVID-19 outbreak, as well as the decrease in net sales. 
 Days in accounts payable for the three months ended October 2, 2021 increased nineteen days compared to the three months ended October 3, 2020. The increase is due to increased purchasing activity and supply chain constraints to obtain certain components heightened by the COVID-19 outbreak, as well as the decrease in net sales. 
 Days in cash deposits for the three months ended October 2, 2021 increased six days compared to the three months ended October 3, 2020. The increase was primarily attributable to significant deposits received from three customers to cover certain inventory balances. 
 Free Cash Flow. We define free cash flow ("FCF"), a non-GAAP financial measure, as cash flow provided by operations less capital expenditures. FCF was 85.5 million for fiscal 2021 compared to 160.3 million for fiscal 2020, a decrease of 74.8 million. 
 Non-GAAP financial measures, including FCF, are used for internal management assessments because such measures provide additional insight to investors into ongoing financial performance. In particular, we provide FCF because we believe it offers insight into the metrics that are driving management decisions. We view FCF as an important financial metric as it demonstrates our ability to generate cash and can allow us to pursue opportunities that enhance shareholder value. FCF is a non-GAAP financial measure that should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, measures of our financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. 
 A reconciliation of FCF to our financial statements that were prepared using GAAP follows (in millions): 
 2021 2020 Cash flows provided by operating activities 142.6 210.4 Payments for property, plant and equipment (57.1) (50.1) Free cash flow 85.5 160.3

Table of Contents 

 Investing Activities. Cash flows used in investing activities were 57.0 million for fiscal 2021 compared to 49.9 million for fiscal 2020. The increase in cash used in investing activities was due to a 7.0 million increase in capital expenditures, primarily due to our manufacturing footprint expansion in Bangkok, Thailand. 
 We utilized available cash and operating cash flows as the sources for funding our operating requirements during fiscal 2021. We currently estimate capital expenditures for fiscal 2022 will be approximately 100.0 million to 120.0 million, with manufacturing footprint expansion in Bangkok, Thailand, being the primary use of our capital expenditures. The remainder is expected to be used to support new program ramps and replace older equipment. 
 Financing Activities. Cash flows used in financing activities were 203.9 million for fiscal 2021 compared to 1.5 million for fiscal 2020. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in net payments on the Credit Facility of 126.0 million, an increase of 67.1 million in cash used to repurchase our common stock and a 9.3 million decrease in proceeds from the exercise of stock options. 
 On August 20, 2019, the Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program under which we were authorized to repurchase 50.0 million of our common stock (the "2019 Program"). The 2019 Program commenced upon completion of share repurchase programs. During fiscal 2021 and 2020, the Company repurchased 73,560 and 609,935 shares under this program for 5.3 million and 41.4 million at an average price of 72.44 and 67.86 per share, respectively. 
 On August 13, 2020, the Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program under which we were authorized to repurchase up to 50.0 million of our common stock (the "2021 Program"). On November 18, 2020, the Board of Directors approved an additional 50.0 million in share repurchase authority under the existing 2021 Program such that there then existed a total of 100.0 million in share repurchase authority under the program. The 2021 program commenced upon completion of the 2019 Program during the first quarter of fiscal 2021. During fiscal 2021, the Company repurchased 1,171,246 shares under this program for 100.0 million at an average price of 85.40 per share. 
 On August 11, 2021, the Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase program under which we were authorized to repurchase up to 50.0 million of its common stock (the "2022 Program"). The 2022 Program commenced upon completion of the 2021 Program. The 2022 Program has no expiration. During fiscal 2021, the Company repurchased 34,381 shares under this program for 3.1 million at an average price of 90.16 per share. As of October 2, 2021, 46.9 million of authority remained under the 2022 Program. 
 All shares repurchased under the aforementioned programs were recorded as treasury stock. 
 On June 15, 2018, we entered into a Note Purchase Agreement (the 2018 NPA pursuant to which we issued an aggregate of 150.0 million in principal amount of unsecured senior notes, consisting of 100.0 million in principal amount 4.05 Series A Senior Notes, due on June 15, 2025, and 50.0 million in principal amount of 4.22 Series B Senior Notes, due on June 15, 2028 (collectively, the 2018 Notes ), in a private placement. The 2018 NPA includes customary operational and financial covenants with which we are required to comply, including, among others, maintenance of certain financial ratios such as a total leverage ratio and a minimum interest coverage ratio. The 2018 Notes may be prepaid in whole or in part at any time, subject to payment of a make-whole amount; interest on the 2018 Notes is payable semiannually. As of October 2, 2021, we were in compliance with the covenants under the 2018 NPA. 
 On May 15, 2019, we refinanced our then-existing senior unsecured revolving credit facility by entering into a new five-year senior unsecured revolving credit facility (referred to as the "Credit Facility"), which expanded the maximum commitment from 300.0 million to 350.0 million and extended the maturity from July 5, 2021 to May 15, 2024. The maximum commitment under the Credit Facility may be further increased to 600.0 million, generally by mutual agreement of the lenders and us, subject to certain customary conditions. During fiscal 2021, the highest daily borrowing was 148.0 million; the average daily borrowings were 70.0 million. We borrowed 376.0 million and repaid 321.0 million of revolving borrowings ("revolving commitment") under the Credit Facility during fiscal 2021. As of October 2, 2021, we were in compliance with all financial covenants relating to the Credit Facility, which are generally consistent with those in the 2018 NPA discussed above. We are required to pay a commitment fee on the daily unused revolving commitment based on our leverage ratio; the fee was 0.10 as of October 2, 2021. 
 To further ensure our ability to meet our working capital and fixed capital requirements, on April 29, 2020, we entered into Amendment No. 1 to the Credit Facility (the "Amendment") in response to the COVID-19 outbreak, which amended the Credit Facility, dated as of May 15, 2019. The Amendment modified certain provisions of the Credit Facility to, among other things, provide Term Loans for 138.0 million. Term Loans borrowed under the new facility were funded in a single draw on May 4, 2020 and were scheduled to mature on April 28, 2021. On January 29, 2021, we terminated the Term Loans through repayment of the 138.0 million outstanding using borrowings from the revolving commitment under the Credit Facility. Outstanding

 Term Loans bore interest, at our option, at a eurocurrency rate (subject to a floor of 1.0 plus a margin of 1.75 per annum or at a base rate (subject to a floor of 2.0 plus a margin of 0.75 per annum. 
 The Credit Facility and the 2018 NPA allow for the future payment of cash dividends or the repurchase of shares provided that no event of default (including any failure to comply with a financial covenant) exists at the time of, or would be caused by, the dividend payment or the share repurchases. We have not paid cash dividends in the past. However, we evaluate from time to time potential uses of excess cash, which in the future may include share repurchases above those already authorized, a special dividend or recurring dividends. 
 We have Master Accounts Receivable Purchase Agreements with MUFG Bank, New York Branch (formerly known as The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, Ltd.) (the "MUFG RPA"), HSBC Bank (China) Company Limited, Xiamen branch (the "HSBC RPA") and other agreements with banks, under which we may elect to sell receivables, at a discount, on an ongoing basis. These facilities are uncommitted facilities. The maximum facility amount under the MUFG RPA as of October 2, 2021 is 340.0 million. The maximum facility amount under the HSBC RPA as of October 2, 2021 is 60.0 million. The MUFG RPA will be automatically extended each year unless any party gives no less than 10 days prior notice that the agreement should not be extended. The terms of the HSBC RPA are generally consistent with the terms of the MUFG RPA previously discussed. 
 We sold 730.5 million and 834.4 million of trade accounts receivable under these programs during fiscal 2021 and 2020, respectively, in exchange for cash proceeds of 728.4 million and 831.2 million, respectively. As of October 2, 2021 and October 3, 2020, 176.0 million and 244.3 million, respectively, of accounts receivables sold under trade accounts receivable programs and subject to servicing by us remained outstanding and had not yet been collected. 
 In all cases, the sale discount was recorded within "Miscellaneous, net" in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income in the period of the sale. For further information regarding the receivable sale programs, see Note 14, "Trade Accounts Receivable Sale Programs," in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 Based on current expectations, we believe that our projected cash flows provided by operations, available cash and cash equivalents, potential borrowings under the Credit Facility and our leasing capabilities should be sufficient to meet our working capital and fixed capital requirements, as well as execution upon our share repurchase authorizations as management deems appropriate, for the next twelve months. We believe we are positioned with a strong balance sheet as we face the future challenges presented by COVID-19. As of the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash were 271 million, while debt, finance lease obligations and other financing were 253 million. In addition to our strong balance sheet, we have significant funding availability through our Credit Facility, should future needs arise. If our future financing needs increase, then we may need to arrange additional debt or equity financing. Accordingly, we evaluate and consider from time to time various financing alternatives to supplement our financial resources. However, we cannot be assured that we will be able to make any such arrangements on acceptable terms.

CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS, COMMITMENTS AND OFF-BALANCE SHEET OBLIGATIONS 
 Our disclosures regarding contractual obligations and commercial commitments are located in various parts of our regulatory filings. Information in the following table provides a summary of our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of October 2, 2021 (dollars in millions): 
 Payments Due by Fiscal Year Contractual Obligations Total 2022 2023-2024 2025-2026 2027 and thereafter Debt Obligations (1) 236.0 61.2 12.3 108.3 54.2 Finance Lease Obligations 120.9 9.4 12.8 10.4 88.3 Operating Lease Obligations 55.3 10.8 16.2 10.3 18.0 Purchase Obligations (2) 1,619.1 1,424.1 192.8 1.5 0.7 Repatriation Tax on Undistributed Foreign Earnings (3) 53.6 5.6 16.2 31.8 Other Liabilities on the Balance Sheet (4) 18.8 4.5 3.1 0.2 11.0 Other Liabilities not on the Balance Sheet (5) 8.3 3.8 1.2 3.3 Total Contractual Cash Obligations 2,112.0 1,519.4 254.6 162.5 175.5 
 
 1) Debt obligations includes 150.0 million in principal amount of 2018 Notes and 55.0 million of borrowings on the revolving commitment of the Credit Facility, as well as interest. 
 2) Purchase obligations consist primarily of purchases of inventory and equipment in the ordinary course of business. 
 3) Repatriation tax on undistributed foreign earnings consists of U.S. federal income taxes on the deemed repatriation of undistributed foreign earnings due to U.S. Tax Reform. Refer to "Liquidity and Capital Resources" above for further detail. 
 4) Other obligations on the balance sheet included deferred compensation obligations to certain of our former and current executive officers, as well as other key employees, other financing obligations arising from information technology maintenance agreements and asset retirement obligations related to our buildings. We have excluded from the above table the impact of approximately 4.6 million, as of October 2, 2021, related to unrecognized income tax benefits. We cannot make reliable estimates of the future cash flows by period related to these obligations. 
 5) Other obligations not on the balance sheet consist of guarantees and a commitment for salary continuation and certain benefits in the event employment of one executive officer is terminated without cause. Excluded from the amounts disclosed are certain bonus and incentive compensation amounts, which would be paid on a prorated basis in the year of termination.

 DISCLOSURE ABOUT CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES 
 Our accounting policies are disclosed in Note 1 "Description of Business and Significant Accounting Policies" of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. During fiscal 2021 there were no material changes to these policies. Our more critical accounting estimates are described below: 
 Revenue Recognition: Revenue is recognized over time for arrangements with customers for which: (i) our performance does not create an asset with an alternative use to us, and (ii) we have an enforceable right to payment, including reasonable profit margin, for performance completed to date. If either of the two conditions noted above are not met to recognize revenue over time, revenue is recognized following the transfer of control of such products to the customer, which typically occurs upon shipment or delivery depending on the terms of the underlying arrangement. 
 For contracts requiring over time revenue recognition, we calculate the revenue to recognize using the costs incurred to date plus a reasonable profit margin. We use historical information to estimate the profit margin associated with the performance obligation that is satisfied over time. We reevaluate our estimate of profit margins on a quarterly basis. While experience has shown that trends in profit margins are not volatile, changes in pricing or cost efficiencies could create significant fluctuations for certain performance obligations. As actual experience becomes available, we use the data to update the historical averages and compare the results to estimates. Based on review of profits margins we update our estimate to the model as necessary. 
 See Note 15 "Revenue from Contracts with Customers" of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on our revenue recognition policies. 
 Income Taxes: Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. We maintain valuation allowances when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. In determining whether a valuation allowance is required, we take into account such factors as: 
 Prior earnings history . A pattern of recent financial reporting losses in a jurisdiction is heavily weighted as a source of negative evidence. We also consider the strength and trend of earnings, as well as other relevant factors. In certain circumstances, historical earnings may not be as relevant due to changes in our business operations; 
 Expected future earnings. Future reversals of existing temporary differences are heavily weighted sources of objectively verifiable positive evidence. Projections of future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences are an additional source of positive evidence; 
 Tax planning strategies . If necessary and available, tax planning strategies would be implemented to accelerate taxable amounts to utilize expiring carryforwards. These strategies would be a source of additional positive evidence. 
 
 See Note 6 "Income Taxes" of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on our income tax policies.

 ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 We are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign exchange and interest rates. We selectively use financial instruments to reduce such risks. We do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes. 
 Foreign Currency Risk 
 Our international operations create potential foreign exchange risk. Our policy is to selectively hedge our foreign currency denominated transactions in a manner that partially offsets the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We typically use foreign currency contracts to hedge only those currency exposures associated with certain assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies. Corresponding gains and losses on the underlying transaction generally offset the gains and losses on these foreign currency hedges. We cannot predict changes in currency rates, nor the degree to which we will be able to manage the impacts of currency exchange rate changes, including the impacts on currency exchange rates related to the COVID-19 outbreak. Such changes could have a material effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
 Our percentages of transactions denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar for the indicated fiscal years were as follows: 
 2021 2020 Net Sales 10 10 Total Costs 16 16 
 We have evaluated the potential foreign currency exchange rate risk on transactions denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar for the periods presented above. Based on our overall currency exposure, as of October 2, 2021, a 10.0 change in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to our other transactional currencies would not have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 We have financial instruments, including cash equivalents and debt, which are sensitive to changes in interest rates. The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal, while maximizing yields without significantly increasing market risk. To achieve this, we limit the amount of principal exposure to any one issuer. We cannot predict changes in interest rates, including the impacts on interest rates related to the COVID-19 outbreak. 
 As of October 2, 2021, our only material interest rate risk is associated with our Credit Facility. Revolving commitments under the Credit Facility bear interest, at our option, at a eurocurrency or base rate plus, in each case, an applicable interest rate margin based on our then-current leverage ratio (as defined in the Credit Facility). As of October 2, 2021, the borrowing rate under the Credit Facility was LIBOR plus 1.00 . Borrowings under the 2018 NPA are based on a fixed interest rate, thus mitigating much of our interest rate risk. Based on our overall interest rate exposure, as of October 2, 2021, a 10.0 change in interest rates would not have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.

 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
 To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Plexus Corp. 
 
 Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 We have audited the consolidated financial statements, including the related notes, of Plexus Corp. and its subsidiaries (the Company as listed in the accompanying index (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements ). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of October 2, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). 
 
 In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of October 2, 2021 and October 3, 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended October 2, 2021 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of October 2, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO. 
 
 Basis for Opinions 
 
 The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. 
 
 Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. 
 
 Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

 Critical Audit Matters 
 
 The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. 
 
 Arrangements with customers for which revenue is recognized over time 
 
 As described in Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements, approximately 91 of the Company s revenue for the year ended October 2, 2021 was recognized as products were produced or services were rendered over time. Revenue is recognized over time for arrangements with customers for which (i) the Company s performance does not create an asset with an alternative use to the Company and (ii) the Company has an enforceable right to payment, including a reasonable profit margin, for performance completed to date. Determining if an enforceable right to payment includes a reasonable profit margin requires judgment and is assessed on a contract by contract basis. If either of these two conditions are not met to recognize revenue over time, revenue is recognized following the transfer of control of such products to the customer, which typically occurs upon shipment or delivery depending on the terms of the underlying arrangement. Management recognizes revenue over time using a cost-based input measurement of progress. Under this method, the extent of progress towards completion is measured based on the costs incurred to date. Revenue recognized over time is estimated based on costs incurred to date plus a reasonable profit margin. 
 
 The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to arrangements with customers for which revenue is recognized over time is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment by management in (i) determining which arrangements with customers meet the criteria for revenue to be recognized over time and (ii) estimating a reasonable profit margin related to the amount of revenue to be recognized for in-progress performance obligations. This in turn led to significant auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures to evaluate which arrangements meet the criteria for revenue to be recognized over time, management s estimate of reasonable profit margins, and management s determination of costs incurred to date. 
 
 Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the revenue recognition process, including controls relating to management s determination of which arrangements with customers met the criteria for revenue to be recognized over time and estimating the amount of revenue recognized for these arrangements. These procedures also included, among others, (i) testing management s process for determining which arrangements with customers met the criteria for revenue to be recognized over time, (ii) testing the accuracy and completeness of costs incurred to date for selected arrangements, (iii) evaluating the reasonableness of management s estimate of profit margins, and (iv) testing the appropriateness of the timing and amount of revenue recognized based on the underlying inputs and estimates for selected arrangements.

The Company uses quoted market prices when available or discounted cash flows to calculate fair value. If measured at fair value in the financial statements, long-term debt (including the current portion) would be classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy described below. The fair values of the Company s derivatives are disclosed in Note 5, "Derivatives and Fair Value Measurements." The fair values of the deferred compensation assets held under trust arrangements are discussed in Note 9, "Benefit Plans." 
 Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (or exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Valuation techniques used to measure fair value must maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. The accounting guidance establishes a fair value hierarchy based on three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value. The input levels are: 
 Level 1: Quoted (observable) market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. 
 Level 2: Inputs other than Level 1 that are observable, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the asset or liability. 
 Level 3: Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the asset or liability.

 In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02 Topic 842 ), which is intended to improve financial reporting of lease transactions by requiring lessees to recognize most leases as a right-of-use ROU asset and lease liability on their balance sheets for the rights and obligations created by leases, but record expenses on their income statements in a similar manner. Topic 842 also requires disclosures regarding the amount, timing and judgments related to accounting for an entity's leases and related cash flows. On September, 29, 2019, the Company adopted Topic 842 using the modified retrospective method of adoption, which allows financial information for comparative periods prior to adoption not to be updated. Upon adoption, the Company recognized a million reduction in retained earnings as a result of two existing build-to-suit arrangements for facilities in Guadalajara, Mexico that were reassessed to be finance leases under the new standard. 
 In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, which replaces the current incurred loss impairment methodology with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and required consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates. The Company adopted this guidance during the first quarter of fiscal 2021 with no material impact to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted: 
 The Company believes that no other recently issued accounting standards will have a material impact on its Consolidated Financial Statements, or apply to its operations.

 On June 15, 2018, the Company entered into a Note Purchase Agreement (the 2018 NPA pursuant to which it issued an aggregate of million in principal amount of unsecured senior notes, consisting of million in principal amount of Series A Senior Notes, due on June 15, 2025, and million in principal amount of Series B Senior Notes, due on June 15, 2028 (collectively, the 2018 Notes ), in a private placement. The 2018 NPA includes customary operational and financial covenants with which the Company is required to comply, including, among others, maintenance of certain financial ratios such as a total leverage ratio and a minimum interest coverage ratio. The 2018 Notes may be prepaid in whole or in part at any time, subject to payment of a make-whole amount; interest on the 2018 Notes is payable semiannually. As of October 2, 2021, the Company was in compliance with the covenants under the 2018 NPA. 
 On May 15, 2019, the Company refinanced its then-existing senior unsecured revolving credit facility by entering into a new -year senior unsecured revolving credit facility (referred to as the "Credit Facility"), which expanded the maximum commitment from million to million and extended the maturity from July 5, 2021 to May 15, 2024. The maximum commitment under the Credit Facility may be further increased to million, generally by mutual agreement of the Company and the lenders, subject to certain customary conditions. During fiscal 2021, the highest daily borrowing was million; the average daily borrowings were million. The Company borrowed million and repaid million of revolving borrowings ("revolving commitment") under the Credit Facility during fiscal 2021. As of October 2, 2021, the Company was in compliance with all financial covenants relating to the Credit Facility, which are generally consistent with those in the 2018 NPA discussed above. The Company is required to pay a commitment fee on the daily unused revolving commitment based on the Company's leverage ratio; the fee was as of October 2, 2021. 
 To further ensure our ability to meet our working capital and fixed capital requirements, on April 29, 2020, the Company entered into Amendment No. 1 to the Credit Facility (the "Amendment") in response to the COVID-19 outbreak, which amended the Credit Facility, dated as of May 15, 2019. The Amendment modified certain provisions of the Credit Facility to, among other things, provide for a day unsecured delayed draw term loans ("Term Loans") for million. Term Loans borrowed under the new facility were funded in a single draw on May 4, 2020 and were scheduled to mature on April 28, 2021.

 The Company enters into forward currency exchange contracts for its operations in Malaysia and Mexico on a rolling basis. The Company had cash flow hedges outstanding with a notional value of million as of October 2, 2021, and a notional value of million as of October 3, 2020. These forward currency contracts fix the exchange rates for the settlement of future foreign currency obligations that have yet to be realized. The total fair value of the forward currency exchange contracts was a million liability as of October 2, 2021, and a million asset as of October 3, 2020. 
 The Company had additional forward currency exchange contracts outstanding as of October 2, 2021, with a notional value of million; there were million such contracts outstanding as of October 3, 2020.

 Fair Value Measurements: 
 Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (or exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Valuation techniques used to measure fair value must maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. The Company uses quoted market prices when available or discounted cash flows to calculate fair value. The accounting guidance establishes a fair value hierarchy based on three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value. The input levels are: 
 Level 1: Quoted (observable) market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. 
 Level 2: Inputs other than Level 1 that are observable, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the asset or liability.

 The effective tax rate for fiscal 2021 was relatively consistent compared to the effective tax rate for fiscal 2020. The effective tax rate for fiscal 2020 was lower than the effective tax rate for fiscal 2019 primarily due to the geographic distribution of worldwide earnings. During fiscal 2019, the Company reasserted that certain historical undistributed earnings of two foreign subsidiaries would be permanently reinvested, which provided a million benefit to the effective tax rate. The impact of the changes in the Company's assertion has been included in "Withholding tax on dividends" in the effective income tax reconciliation above. 
 During fiscal 2021, the Company recorded a million decrease to its valuation allowance primarily due to a net decrease of the valuation allowance in the EMEA segment driven by the release of the valuation allowance against the net deferred tax assets of a foreign subsidiary. This is partially offset by continuing losses in certain jurisdictions within the AMER segment. 
 During fiscal 2020, the Company recorded a million increase to its valuation allowance due to continuing losses in certain jurisdictions within the AMER and EMEA segments, partially offset by an expiration of net operating losses that had a valuation allowance recorded. 
 During fiscal 2019, the Company recorded a million increase to its valuation allowance due to continuing losses in certain jurisdictions within the AMER and EMEA segments, partially offset by an expiration of net operating losses that had a valuation allowance recorded.

 During fiscal 2021, the Company s valuation allowance decreased by million. This decrease is the result of decreases to the valuation allowances against the net deferred tax assets in the EMEA region of million, partially offset by increases to the valuation allowances in the AMER region of million. 
 As of October 2, 2021, the Company had approximately million of pre-tax state net operating loss carryforwards that expire between fiscal 2022 and 2042. Certain state net operating losses have a full valuation allowance against them. The Company also had approximately million of pre-tax foreign net operating loss carryforwards that expire between fiscal 2022 and 2028 or are indefinitely carried forward. Certain foreign net operating losses have a full valuation allowance against them. 
 The Company has been granted a tax holiday for a foreign subsidiary in the APAC segment. This tax holiday will expire on December 31, 2034, and is subject to certain conditions with which the Company expects to continue to comply. During fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, the tax holiday resulted in tax reductions, net of the impact of the GILTI provisions of U.S. Tax Reform, of approximately million per basic share, per diluted share), million per basic share, per diluted share) and million per basic share, per diluted share), respectively. 
 The Company does not provide for taxes that would be payable if certain undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries were remitted because the Company considers these earnings to be permanently reinvested. The deferred tax liability that has not been recorded for these earnings was approximately million as of October 2, 2021. 
 The Company has approximately million of uncertain tax benefits as of October 2, 2021. The Company has classified these amounts in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as "Other liabilities" (non-current) in the amount of million and an offset to "Deferred income taxes" (non-current asset) in the amount of million as the payment is not anticipated within one year.

 The Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. The total accrued penalties and net accrued interest with respect to income taxes was approximately million for fiscal 2021 and 2020, and approximately million for fiscal 2019.

 year to years. Renewal options that are deemed reasonably certain are included as part of the lease term for purposes of calculating the right-of-use ROU asset and lease liability. Variable lease payments are generally expensed as incurred and include certain index-based changes in rent, certain nonlease components, such as maintenance and other services provided by the lessor, and other charges included in the lease. The Company elected the practical expedient to not separate lease and nonlease components, as such nonlease components are included in the calculation of the ROU asset and lease liability and included in the lease expense over the term of the lease. The Company uses a discount rate to calculate the ROU asset and lease liability. When the implicit rate is known or provided in the lease documents, the Company is required to use this rate. In cases in which the implicit rate is not known, the Company uses an estimated incremental borrowing rate. 
 Operating lease ROU assets and lease liabilities are recorded on the date the Company takes possession of the leased assets with expense recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Leases with an estimated total term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet and the lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Generally, the Company's lease agreements do not contain material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants. 
 
 Interest on lease liabilities Operating lease expense Other lease expense Total 
 Based on the nature of the ROU asset, amortization of finance right-of-use assets, operating lease expense and other lease expense are recorded within either cost of goods sold or selling and administrative expenses and interest on finance lease liabilities is recorded within interest expense on the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. Other lease expense includes lease expense for leases with an estimated total term of twelve months or less and variable lease expense related to variations in lease payments as a result of a change in factors or circumstances occurring after the lease possession date. 
 Amortization of assets held under capital leases totaled million for fiscal 2019. Capital lease additions totaled million for fiscal 2019. Rent expense under all operating leases for fiscal 2019 was approximately million.

 ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE 
 None. 
 
 ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure that the information the Company must disclose in its filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") is recorded, processed, summarized and reported on a timely basis. The Company s Chief Executive Officer ("CEO") and Chief Financial Officer ("CFO") have reviewed and evaluated, with the participation of the Company s management, the Company s disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act") as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on such evaluation, the CEO and CFO have concluded that, as of October 2, 2021, the Company s disclosure controls and procedures are effective, at the reasonable assurance level, (a) in recording, processing, summarizing and reporting, on a timely basis, information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports the Company files or submits under the Exchange Act, and (b) in assuring that information is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including the CEO and CFO, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 Management s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 Management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f). Management of the Company, including its CEO and CFO, has assessed the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting as of October 2, 2021, based on the criteria established in "Internal Control - Integrated Framework" issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ("COSO") (2013). Based on its assessment and those criteria, management has reached the conclusion that the Company's internal control over financial reporting was effective. 
 The independent registered public accounting firm of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP has audited the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of October 2, 2021, as stated in its report included herein. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 There have been no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the Company s most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting. 
 Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls 
 Our management, including our CEO and CFO, does not expect that our disclosure controls and internal controls will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple errors or mistakes. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the control. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, a control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Notwithstanding the foregoing limitations on the effectiveness of controls, we have nonetheless reached the conclusion that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting are effective.

Exhibit 4.3 
 DESCRIPTION OF COMMON STOCK 
 
 The following summary highlights selected information about the common stock of Plexus Corp. Plexus, the Company, we, us, or our ). This summary does not purport to be exhaustive and is qualified in its entirety by reference to applicable Wisconsin law, as well as to our Articles and our Amended and Restated Bylaws. 
 
 The Plexus Restated Articles of Incorporation, as amended (the Articles ), authorize Plexus to issue 200,000,000 shares of common stock and 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock, .01 par value. The preferred stock may be issued in such series, and with such designations, as the Board of Directors may specify at the time of issuance. The Articles currently designate 2,000,000 of the preferred shares as Series B Junior Participating Preferred Stock. However, there are not any shares of Series B Junior Participating Preferred Stock outstanding, nor are any rights to acquire such shares outstanding all prior powers, preferences, special rights, terms of and rights to acquire such shares have expired. 
 
 The holders of Plexus common stock are entitled to one vote for each share held of record on each matter submitted to a vote of shareholders. Shareholders have no cumulative voting rights, which means that the holders of shares entitled to exercise more than 50 of the voting rights are able to elect all of the directors. The Articles do not provide for classification of the Board of Directors. 
 
 Subject to any prior rights of holders of preferred stock, dividends may be paid to holders of common stock when, as and if declared by the Board of Directors out of funds legally available therefor, subject to any contractual restrictions on the payment of dividends. If Plexus is liquidated, dissolved or wound up, the holders of common stock will be entitled to receive their pro rata share of the assets of Plexus remaining after payment or provision for payment of its debts and other liabilities and the amount of any preferred stock liquidation preference. 
 
 All of our issued and outstanding shares are fully paid and nonassessable. 
 
 The holders of common stock are not entitled to any preemptive, subscription, redemption or conversion rights. 
 
 The transfer agent and registrar of the Company s common stock is AST Financial. 
 
 The Company s common stock trades on the Nasdaq Stock Market in the Nasdaq Global Select Market tier (symbol PLXS). 
 
 Certain Statutory Provisions 
 
 The Wisconsin Business Corporation Law (the WBCL ), under which Plexus is incorporated, contains certain provisions that may be important when considering the rights of 
 1 

holders of our capital stock. The description set forth below is a summary only. For complete information, we encourage you to review the applicable provisions of the WBCL. 
 
 Business Combination Statute . Sections 180.1140 to 180.1144 of the WBCL regulate a broad range of business combinations between a resident domestic corporation and an interested shareholder. A business combination is defined to include any of the following transactions 
 a merger or share exchange 
 a sale, lease, exchange, mortgage, pledge, transfer or other disposition of assets equal to 5 or more of the aggregate market value of the stock or consolidated assets of the resident domestic corporation or 10 of its consolidated earning power or income 
 the issuance or transfer of stock or rights to purchase stock with a market value equal to 5 or more of the outstanding stock of the resident domestic corporation 
 the adoption of a plan of liquidation or dissolution and 
 certain other transactions involving an interested shareholder. 
 A resident domestic corporation is defined to mean a Wisconsin corporation that has a class of voting stock that is registered or traded on a national securities exchange or that is registered under Section 12(g) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and that, as of the relevant date, satisfies any of the following 
 its principal offices are located in Wisconsin 
 it has significant business operations located in Wisconsin 
 more than 10 of the holders of record of its shares are residents of Wisconsin or 
 more than 10 of its shares are held of record by residents of Wisconsin. 
 Plexus is a resident domestic corporation for purposes of these statutory provisions. 
 An interested shareholder is defined to mean a person who beneficially owns, directly or indirectly, 10 of the voting power of the outstanding voting stock of a resident domestic corporation or who is an affiliate or associate of the resident domestic corporation and beneficially owned 10 of the voting power of its then outstanding voting stock within the last three years. 
 Under this law, we cannot engage in a business combination with an interested shareholder for a period of three years following the date such person becomes an interested 
 2 

shareholder, unless the board of directors approved the business combination or the acquisition of the stock that resulted in the person becoming an interested shareholder before such acquisition. We may engage in a business combination with an interested shareholder after the expiration of the three-year period with respect to that shareholder only if one or more of the following conditions is satisfied 
 the board of directors approved the acquisition of the stock prior to such shareholder's acquisition date 
 the business combination is approved by a majority of the outstanding voting stock not beneficially owned by the interested shareholder or 
 the consideration to be received by shareholders meets certain fair price requirements of the statute with respect to form and amount. 
 Fair Price Statute . The WBCL also provides, in Sections 180.1130 to 180.1133, that certain mergers, share exchanges or sales, leases, exchanges or other dispositions of assets in a transaction involving a significant shareholder and a resident domestic corporation, such as Plexus, require a supermajority vote of shareholders in addition to any approval otherwise required, unless shareholders receive a fair price for their shares that satisfies a statutory formula. A significant shareholder for this purpose is defined as a person or group who beneficially owns, directly or indirectly, 10 or more of the voting stock of the resident domestic corporation, or is an affiliate of the resident domestic corporation and beneficially owned, directly or indirectly, 10 or more of the voting stock of the resident domestic corporation within the last two years. Any business combination to which the statute applies must be approved by 80 of the voting power of the resident domestic corporation's stock and at least two-thirds of the voting power of its stock not beneficially owned by the significant shareholder who is party to the relevant transaction or any of its affiliates or associates, in each case voting together as a single group, unless the following fair price standards have been met 
 the aggregate value of the per share consideration is equal to the highest of 
 the highest per share price paid for any common shares of the corporation by the significant shareholder in the transaction in which it became a significant shareholder or within two years before the date of the business combination 
 the market value per share of the corporation's shares on the date of commencement of any tender offer by the significant shareholder, the date on which the person became a significant shareholder or the date of the first public announcement of the proposed business combination, whichever is highest or 
 the highest preferential liquidation or dissolution distribution to which holders of the shares would be entitled and 
 3 

either cash, or the form of consideration used by the significant shareholder to acquire the largest number of shares, is offered. 
 Control Share Voting Restrictions . Under Section 180.1150 of the WBCL, unless otherwise provided in the articles of incorporation or otherwise specified by the board of directors, the voting power of shares of a resident domestic corporation held by any person or group of persons acting together in excess of 20 of the voting power in the election of directors is limited (in voting on any matter) to 10 of the full voting power of those shares. This restriction does not apply to shares acquired directly from the resident domestic corporation, in certain specified transactions, or in a transaction in which the corporation's shareholders have approved restoration of the full voting power of the otherwise restricted shares. The Company s Articles do not provide otherwise. 
 Defensive Action Restrictions . Section 180.1134 of the WBCL provides that, in addition to the vote otherwise required by law or the articles of incorporation of a resident domestic corporation, the approval of the holders of a majority of the shares entitled to vote on the proposal is required before the corporation can take certain action while a takeover offer is being made or after a takeover offer has been publicly announced and before it is concluded. This statute requires shareholder approval for the corporation to do either of the following 
 acquire more than 5 of its outstanding voting shares at a price above the market price from any individual or organization that owns more than 3 of the outstanding voting shares and has held such shares for less than two years, unless a similar offer is made to acquire all voting shares and all securities which may be converted into voting shares or 
 sell or option assets of the corporation which amount to 10 or more of the market value of the corporation, unless the corporation has at least three independent directors (directors who are not officers or employees) and a majority of the independent directors vote not to have this provision apply to the corporation. 
 We currently have more than three independent directors. The foregoing restrictions may have the effect of deterring a shareholder from acquiring our shares with the goal of seeking to have us repurchase such shares at a premium over market price. 
 Constituency or Stakeholder Provision . Under Section 180.0827 of the WBCL, in discharging his or her duties to Plexus and in determining what he or she believes to be in the best interests of Plexus, a director or officer may, in addition to considering the effects of any action on shareholders, consider the effects of the action on employees, suppliers, customers, the communities in which we operate and any other factors that the director or officer considers pertinent. 
 The foregoing provisions of Wisconsin law, our ability to issue additional shares of common stock and preferred stock without further shareholder approval (except as may be required by the Nasdaq Global Select Market corporate governance standards) and the ability of 
 4 

our Board of Directors to fix the designations of classes of preferred stock (including the ability to issue preferred stock with substantial voting rights) could have the effect, among others, of discouraging take-over proposals for or impeding a business combination involving Plexus.
