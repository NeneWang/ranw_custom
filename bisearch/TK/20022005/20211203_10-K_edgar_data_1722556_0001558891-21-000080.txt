 PART I 
 
 Item 1. Business 
 
 Overview 
 
 BestGofer intends to focus on the delivery industry by providing consumers with the ability of having any desired retail item purchased on their behalf delivered directly to their door at any given time. 
 
 The Company plans on serving consumers through the convenience of a smart phone app by notifying local delivery staff (called Gofers through an online communication system of a desired pick up or delivery request, such as groceries, business packages, personal items etc. 
 
 The consumer must state a maximum dollar amount at the time of notification, restricting Gofers from unauthorized spending on behalf of the consumer. 
 
 Consumers may be retailers, businesses or individuals who need assistance or those who simply wish enjoy the advantage of door step delivery for any convenience item. Eligible consumers must be over the age of 18 and own a valid credit card. Credit cards of consumers will be linked through the app and charged at the time of delivery. Deliveries are subject to a fee; an amount agreed upon by both parties; Gofer and consumer. 
 
 Items of delivery must meet our criteria: weight limit of 40 lbs per delivery, no prescription drugs, etc. Items of delivery must be accessible retail items. Prohibited items of purchase include: pornographic content, controlled substances (ie. drugs, marijuana etc.); eliveries over 40 lbs; orders exceeding the 400 limit; delivery of persons. Gofers may exercise their right to refuse service should the item criteria not be met. 
 
 There are no specific privacy regulations that affect our, however credit card users have certain rights as defined in such statutes as the Fair Credit Billing Act of 1986 (FCBA). Under the FCBA, a customer can dispute charges and we may have to refund any payments if the credit card company agrees with the customer. 
 3 

Product and Services 
 
 BestGofer App: 
 
 Qualified consumers will be required to open an online account using the Gofer app on their smart phone, which will require details such as name, address, contact and credit card information. 
 
 Regulation of privacy will be enforced through our secured online platform where both consumers as well contracted drivers will set up their accounts. Credit cards will need to be valid. No payments will be accepted by the driver at any time during the delivery process. The credit cards will be charged upon completion of deliver via the Gofer platform. Drivers will be required to sign a liability waiver prior to contract commencement. Drivers will also be required to complete a criminal record check as well submit updated driving records. 
 
 Drivers will be independent contractors. Driver application forms can be completed online via website. Upon application approval, drivers will complete an employment contract and download the Gofer app where they can access their vendor profiles. Successful applicants will have passed the criminal record and driver-screening requirements as well provide proof of American citizenship or a worker visa. 
 
 Drivers will be recruited through websites targeting career opportunities. We plan to engage independent website construction contractors who will design, approve logarithms, individual page content and then test and approve the site launch. It is planned to launch the website during the fiscal year ending November 30, 2022. 
 
 Upon opening the application, the first function will locate a Gofer nearest the user or desired destination of pick-up. 
 
 Second, one or more of the following five categories must be selected: Grocery, Restaurant, Convenience, Liquor and Courier Services. Once a category has been selected, a window to enter the details of pick up will appear where the consumer will enter precisely the address of the retailer and exactly what they need (i.e. four apples, a copy of a magazine, one bottle of aspirin, etc.). An option to upload a picture from a smart phone of the exact product desired will be on the App. Thirdly, the user will be prompted to enter a maximum dollar amount that may be spent on the purchase of up to 400.00. 
 
 Upon completion of the above three steps, the user will complete the service call by pressing the Find Gofer key. This key, in turn, will notify the nearest Gofer having been selected in the first function that a customer is requesting their service. 
 
 BestGofer, Drivers: 
 
 An eligible Gofer driver will be required to pass a criminal record check, possess a valid drivers license, have access to a vehicle and good communications skills. 
 
 Once the eligible driver has met company standards, they will be required to choose their desired city of occupation. BestGofer will provide maps to each driver for their designated city, in which drivers will be responsible for learning the whereabouts of each retail, restaurant and service location. This will facilitate quicker deliveries. 
 
 Each Gofer driver will download the app and open a personalized service account. While open, the app will track the location of the Gofer, notifying consumers of their whereabouts. 
 
 Upon receiving a service request from a consumer, the Gofer will reply to the request with an offered fee for service or refuse service. Once mutually agreed upon by both parties, the Gofer may perform the service. 
 
 Upon pick up of merchandise, gofers will provide their own means to facilitate the purchase, while placing a money hold on the consumer s credit card of the maximum allowable purchase price set out by the consumer in the third function of their order; thus offering security to the Gofers purchase. 
 4 

Gofers must use caution to ensure grocery and convenient items are not damaged at time of pick up, as the Gofer will be responsible for the costs of returning damaged merchandise. Consumers will not be required to pay a service fee upon receiving damaged merchandise. 
 
 Gofers may receive tips for their service. 
 
 Drivers will be independent contractors. Driver application forms can be completed online via our website. Upon application approval, drivers will complete an employment contract and download the Gofer app where they can access their vendor profiles. Successful applicants will have passed the criminal record and driver-screening requirements, as well provide proof of American citizenship or working visa. 
 
 Drivers will be recruited through websites targeting career opportunities.

 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
 
 To the Board of Directors Audit Committee: 
 BestGopher, Inc. 
 
 Opinion on the Financial Statements 
 We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of BestGopher, Inc. as of November 30, 2020 and 2019 and the related statements of operations, changes in stockholders (deficit)/equity and cash flows for the periods then ended, and the related notes (collectively referred to as financial statements ). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of November 30, 2020 and 2019 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the periods then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
 
 Critical Audit Matters 
 The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audits of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. 
 
 Going Concern 
 As described further in Note B to the financial statements, the Company has incurred losses each year from inception through November 30, 2020 and expects to incur additional losses in the future. 
 We determined the Company s ability to continue as a going concern is a critical audit matter due to the estimation and uncertainty regarding the Company s future cash flows and the risk of bias in management s judgments and assumptions in estimating these cash flows. 
 Our audit procedures related to the Company s assertion on its ability to continue as a going concern included the following, among others: 
 We reviewed the Company s working capital and liquidity ratios and forecasted revenue, operating expenses, and uses and sources of cash used in management s assessment of whether the Company has sufficient liquidity to fund operations for at least one year from the financial statement issuance date. This testing included inquiries with management, comparison of prior period forecasts to actual results, consideration of positive and negative evidence impacting management s forecasts, the Company s financing arrangements in place as of the report date, market and industry factors and consideration of the Company s relationships with its financing partners. 
 Going Concern 
 The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note B to the financial statements, although the Company has limited operations it has yet to attain profitability. This raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management s plan in regard to these matters is also described in Note B. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 
 
 Basis for Opinion 
 These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audit, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 
 Our audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audit provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

 We have served as the Company s auditor since 2018.

Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure. 
 
 There are none. 
 
 Item 9A. Controls and Procedures. 
 
 As of December 31, 2020, Chief Executive Officer of the Company evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13a 15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Based on the evaluation of these controls and procedures required by paragraph (b) of Sec. 240.13a-15 or 240.15d-15 the disclosure controls and procedures have been found to be not effective. 
 
 The Company maintains a set of disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in our reports filed under the securities Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified by the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls are also designed with the objective of ensuring that this information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 
 Evaluation of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
 Management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of November 30, 2020. In making this assessment, management used the criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, or COSO (2013). The COSO framework summarizes each of the components of a company s internal control system, including (i) the control environment, (ii) risk assessment, (iii) control activities, (iv) information and communication, and (v) monitoring. In management s assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f)) as required by Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(c), our management concluded as of the end of the fiscal year covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K that our internal control over financial reporting has not been effective. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
 There were no changes in the Company's internal control over financial reporting during the year ended November 30, 2020 that have materially impacted, or are reasonably likely to materially impact, the Company s internal control over financial reporting. 
 
 Management's Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

The Company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company s assets that could have a material impact on the financial statements. 
 20 

The Company s management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures, or the Company s internal controls over financial reporting, will necessarily prevent all fraud and material errors. An internal control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations on all internal control systems, the Company s internal control system can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving its objectives and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the control. The design of any system of internal control is also based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in circumstances, or because the degree of compliance with the policies and procedures may deteriorate. 
 Management of the Company, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of November 30, 2019 , under the framework in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013), and determined that controls are ineffective due to the Company s small size and lack of segregation of duties. 
 
 This Annual Report does not include an attestation report by our registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management s report was not subject to attestation by our registered public accounting firm pursuant to rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission that permit us to provide only our management report in this Annual Report.
