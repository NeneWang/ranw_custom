OS Support, Inc. is a shell company as defined in Rule 405, because it is a company with nominal operations and it has assets consisting solely of cash and cash equivalents. Accordingly, there will be illiquidity of any future trading market until the company is no longer considered a shell company. The Company has not yet implemented its business model and to date has generated no revenues. On April 15, 2015, Mr. Paramjit Mann, president and sole director, incorporated the Company in the State of Nevada and established a fiscal year end of June 30. OS Support is a development-stage company that intends to market, sell and provide pay-as-you-go support services for the top 10 Open-source software programs that are downloaded daily. Open-source software (OSS) is computer software with its source code made available with a license in which the copyright holder provides the rights to study, change and distribute the software to anyone and for any purpose. Open-source software is often developed in a public, collaborative manner. Open-source software is the most prominent example of open-source development and often compared to (technically defined) user-generated content or (legally defined) open-content movements. For example, one of the most popular open source software programs is called WordPress , which according to its founder it has been download over 46 million times, and is used in over 60 million websites. The product provides tools and blogging capabilities and is used in the development of websites and mobile applications. As one of our planned supported applications, the Company will provide product support and eventually training to users of WordPress. The Company will initially provide support for following 10 open source applications: 1. WordPress is a free and open source blogging tool and a content management system. 2. Magento is an open source e-commerce web application. 3. Mozilla Firefox is a free and open source web browser. 4. Pidgin is an open-source multi-platform instant messaging client 5. Audacity is a free open source digital audio editor and recording computer software application. 6. Apache OpenOffice is amongst the most well known open source office suites available today. 7. VLC media player is a portable free and open-source cross-platform media player and streaming media server. 8. 7-Zip is an open source application used to compress files. 9. Filezilla is a free and cross-platform FTP software. 10. GIMP is an image retouching and editing tool. Product Description One of the issues with free open source software is that users have little or no support or training available when they are experiencing difficulties and have questions. The Company will offer 3 levels of support: 1. Regular support - 39.00 response within 24 hours with a money back guarantee. 2. Premium Support - 78.00 response with 12 hours. 3. Platinum Support - instant live support one hour minimum 119.00 per hour. The Company initially plans to employ 10 support staff members under contract. Our support staff members will be located in India and will work from their residences in Mohali. Each support staff member will be an expert in two of the top ten Open-source software applications and we plan to have each staff member working or on call in shifts of 12 hours per day. To enhance customer support, the Company plans to utilize Customer Relationship Management software CRM software), Email and Voice Over The Internet VOIP technology. We plan to provide support by telephone using VOIP technology, live interactive chat and desktop sharing tools where support personal can see and control a customer s computer remotely. The Company expects that most support issues will be communicated via email to or planned the support center. The Company feels up to 80 of support issues and or questions can be answered without direct live contact with the customer. The Company will respond within 24 hours of a support issue arriving. The company intends to provide support for small and medium sized companies in the United States. The company's google ad words and other product awareness efforts will be focused on American markets. The Company anticipates all its revenues will be derived from the corporations in United States. Outsourced information technology enabled services do not require any prior approval from any Indian regulatory authority. 3 Table of Contents Where consumers of Information technology enabled services do not fall within India s tax jurisdiction (for example, where the consumers are located in the United States and the service is considered to have been exported to them), no service tax is payable. As service tax is a consumption tax, it is only levied on services consumed in India (The Export of Service Rules 2005, as amended from time to time) (Export Rules). The Export Rules also contain criteria to determine whether a service has been exported from India. Essentially, the export criteria are based on location, performance or recipient, depending on the service in question. For a service to be exported, it must be: Provided from India. Used outside India. Paid for in convertible foreign exchange. Customer payments for services rendered will be held in a bank account that the company intends to open in the state of Nevada. Competitive Environment Companies like OpenLogic, Canonical and Pantek provide a commercial support services for Open-source software. Even OpenOffice.org comes with an option for paid support. Although we know of no single competitor that offers paid for support for all of the applications listed above, management believes that pay-as-you-go support is increasingly an option for businesses.

Unresolved Staff Comments. We are a smaller reporting company as defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information required under this item. Item 2.

We are a smaller reporting company as defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information required under this item. 4 Table of Contents Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. This annual report contains forward looking statements relating to our Company's future economic performance, plans and objectives of management for future operations, projections of revenue mix and other financial items that are based on the beliefs of, as well as assumptions made by and information currently known to, our management. The words "expects , intends , believes , anticipates , may , could , should" and similar expressions and variations thereof are intended to identify forward-looking statements. The cautionary statements set forth in this section are intended to emphasize that actual results may differ materially from those contained in any forward looking statement. Our auditor s report on our June 30, 2021 financial statements expresses an opinion that substantial doubt exists as to whether we can continue as an ongoing business. Since our officer and director may be unwilling or unable to loan or advance us additional capital, we believe that if we do not raise additional capital over the next 12 months, we may be required to suspend or cease the implementation of our business plans. See June 30, 2021 Audited Financial Statements - Auditors Report. Liquidity and Capital Resources As of June 30, 2021, OS Support had NIL in assets, and NIL in assets as of June 30, 2020. Management believes this amount will not satisfy our cash requirements for the next twelve months or until such time that additional proceeds are raised. We plan to satisfy our future cash requirements - primarily the working capital required for the development of our course guides and marketing campaign and to offset legal and accounting fees - by additional equity financing. This will likely be in the form of private placements of common stock. Management believes that if subsequent private placements are successful, we will be able to generate sales revenue within the following twelve months thereof. However, additional equity financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all, and thus we could fail to satisfy our future cash requirements. If OS Support is unsuccessful in raising the additional proceeds through a private placement offering it will then have to seek additional funds through debt financing, which would be highly difficult for a new development stage company to secure. Therefore, the company is highly dependent upon the success of the anticipated private placement offering and failure thereof would result in OS Support having to seek capital from other sources such as debt financing, which may not even be available to the company. However, if such financing were available, because OS Support is a development stage company with no revenue to date, it would likely have to pay additional costs associated with high risk loans and be subject to an above market interest rate. At such time these funds are required, management would evaluate the terms of such debt financing and determine whether the business could sustain operations and growth and manage the debt load. If OS Support cannot raise additional proceeds via a private placement of its common stock or secure debt financing it would be required to cease business operations. As a result, investors in OS Support common stock would lose all of their investment. Results of Operations Since April 15. 2015 (inception) through June 30, 2021, the Company has no revenues and has accumulated losses since inception of 86,402. For fiscal year ended June 30, 2021, we incurred operating expenses in the amount of 24,490 and a net loss of 24,170 as compared to operating expenses of 12,160 and a net loss of 12,541 in for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020. The net loss for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021 was a result of General and administrative fees of 13,990 comprised of printing and filing fees, Professional fees of 10,500 comprised primarily of accounting fees, Exchange Gain of 215 and Interest income of 105. This compares to the net loss for the period ended June 30, 2020 of 12,541 which was a result of General and administrative expense of 1,660 comprised primarily of filing fees and transfer fees, Professional fees of 10,500 comprised primarily of accounting fees, Exchange Loss of 511 and Interest Income of 130. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements. As of the date of this Annual Report, the current funds available to the Company will not be sufficient to continue operations. The cost to establish the Company and begin operations is estimated to be 120,000 over the next twelve months and the cost of maintaining our reporting status is estimated to be 12,000 over this same period. The officer and director during this period. Paramjit Mann, has undertaken to provide the Company with operating capital to sustain the Company s business over the next twelve month period as the expenses are incurred in the form of a non-secured loan. However, there is no contract in place or written agreement securing this agreement. Management believes that if the Company cannot raise sufficient revenues or maintain its reporting status with the SEC it will have to cease all efforts directed towards the Company. As such, any investment previously made would be lost in its entirety. 5 Table of Contents Other than the above described situation the Company does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on the Company's financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors. Going Consideration Our independent auditors included an explanatory paragraph in their report on the accompanying financial statements regarding concerns about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our financial statements contain additional note disclosures describing the circumstances that lead to this disclosure by our independent auditors. Our financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability or classification of asset-carrying amounts or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that may result should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. We are a smaller reporting company as defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information required under this item. 6 Table of Contents OS SUPPORT, INC. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS June 30, 2021 Audited Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of OS Support, Inc. Opinion on the Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of OS Support, Inc. (the Company as of June 30, 2021 and 2020, the related statements of operations, changes in stockholders equity (deficit), and cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended June 30, 2021, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements ). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of June 30, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended June 30, 2021, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Substantial Doubt About the Company s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern . As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, the Company s lack of revenues, recurring operating losses and working capital deficit raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern for one year from the issuance of these financial statements. Management s plans are also described in Note 1. The financial statements do not include adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. Basis of Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audit, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. Our audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit Matters Critical audit matters are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. We determined that there are no critical audit matters. /s/ Boyle CPA, LLC We have served as the Company s auditor since 2020 Red Bank, NJ December 3, 2021 331 Newman Springs Road Building 1, 4 th Floor, Suite 143 Red Bank, NJ 07701 P (732) 822-4427 F (732) 510-0665 7 Table of Contents OS SUPPORT, INC.

NOTES TO THE AUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS June 30, 2021 NOTE 1 NATURE OF OPERATIONS AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION The Company was incorporated in the State of Nevada as a for-profit Company on April 15, 2015 and established a fiscal year end of June 30. The Company is organized to initially provide a pay as you go support service for the top 10 free open sources software programs. Going Concern To date the Company has generated no revenues from its business operations and has incurred operating losses since inception of 86,402. At June 30, 2021, the Company had a working capital deficit of 75,652. The Company requires additional funding to meet its ongoing obligations and to fund anticipated operating losses. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on raising capital to fund its initial business plan and ultimately to attain profitable operations. Accordingly, these factors raise substantial doubt as to the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The Company intends to continue to fund its business by way of private placements and advances from related parties as may be required. Since inception, the Company has issued 30,720,000 founders shares at 0.001 per share for net proceeds of 7,000 to the Company and 24,000,000 shares in private placements at 0.04 per share for net proceeds of 3,750. These financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts, or amounts and classification of liabilities that might result from this uncertainty. NOTE 2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Basis of Presentation The financial statements present the balance sheet, statements of operations, stockholders equity and cash flows of the Company. These financial statements are presented in the United States dollars and have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Reverse Stock Split On October 29, 2021, the Company authorized a 256:1 stock split. As part of the stock split, the CEO waived 1,761,280,000 of the post-split shares, resulting in 23,720,000 additional shares being issued to the CEO. As a result of the stock split, the total outstanding shares of the Company increased from 7,093,750 to 54,720,000. All share and per share data have been retrospectively adjusted to reflect this stock split. Use of Estimates and Assumptions Preparation of the financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect certain reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period. Accordingly, actual results could differ from those estimates. Cash and Cash Equivalents For purposes of the statement of cash flows, the Company considers highly liquid financial instruments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Foreign currency and Translation The Company s functional currency is the US Dollar. Revenues and expenses transacted in currencies other than the functional currency are translated at average rates in effect for the periods presented. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses arising from exchange rate fluctuations on transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency are included in the results of operations. 13 Table of Contents Fair Value of Financial Instruments The carrying amount of the Company s financial assets and liabilities approximates their fair values due to their short-term maturities. Loss per Common Share The basic earnings (loss) per share is calculated by dividing the Company s net income available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares during the year. The diluted earnings (loss) per share is calculated by dividing the Company s net income (loss) available to common shareholders by the diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year. The diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding is the basic weighted number of shares adjusted for any potentially dilutive debt or equity. Diluted earnings (loss) per share are the same as basic earnings (loss) per share due to the lack of dilutive items in the Company. As of June 30, 2021, there were 7,093,750 shares of common stock outstanding. Income Taxes The Company follows the liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax balances and tax loss carry-forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted or substantially enacted tax rates expected to apply to the taxable income in the years in which those differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the date of enactment or substantive enactment. Stock-based Compensation The Company follows ASC 718-10, "Stock Compensation", which addresses the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services, with a primary focus on transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share-based payment transactions. ASC 718-10 is a revision to SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation," and supersedes Accounting Principles Board ("APB") Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees," and its related implementation guidance. ASC 718-10 requires measurement of the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value of the award (with limited exceptions). Incremental compensation costs arising from subsequent modifications of awards after the grant date must be recognized. The Company has not adopted a stock option plan and has not granted any stock options. As of June 30, 2021, the Company had not adopted a stock option plan nor had it granted any stock options. Accordingly no stock-based compensation has been recorded to date.

Changes in and Disagreements With Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure. None Item 9A. Controls and Procedures. Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Disclosure controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time period specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is accumulated and communicated to management including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In connection with this annual report, as required by Rule 13a -15d and 15d-15e under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, we have carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our Company s disclosure controls and procedures. This evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of our Company s management, including our Company s principal executive officer and principal financial officer. Based upon that evaluation, our company s principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that as of June 30, 2021 our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective due to the existence of material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting. Management s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the Company s Principal Executive and Principal Financial officer and effected by the Company s board of directors, management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and includes those policies and procedures that: 1. Pertains to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect our transactions and disposition of assets; 2. Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and receipts and expenditures are being made in accordance with authorizations of management and directors; and 3. Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of company assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements. Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting established in SEC guidance on conducting such assessments as of the end of the period covered by this report. Management conducted the assessment based on certain criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in 2013. As of June 30, 2021, management determined material weaknesses occurred over our internal control over financial reporting as discussed below. The matters involving internal controls and procedures that the Company s management considered to be material weaknesses under the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board were: (1) lack of a functioning audit committee and lack of a majority of outside directors on the Company's board of directors, resulting in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures; (2) inadequate segregation of duties consistent with control objectives; (3) insufficient written policies and procedures for accounting and financial reporting with respect to the requirements and application of US GAAP and SEC disclosure requirements; and (4) ineffective controls over period end financial disclosure and reporting processes. Due to these material weaknesses management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of June 30, 2021. Material Weakness Discussion and Remediation Management believes that the material weaknesses set forth in items (2), (3) and (4) above did not have an affect on the Company's previous reported financial results. However, management believes that the lack of a functioning audit committee and lack of a majority of outside directors on the Company's board of directors, resulting in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures can result in the Company's determination to its financial statements for the future periods. 15 Table of Contents We are committed to improving our financial organization. As part of this commitment, we will create a position to segregate duties consistent with control objectives and will increase our personnel resources and technical accounting expertise within the accounting function when funds are available to the Company: i) Appointing one or more outside directors to our board of directors who shall be appointed to the audit committee of the Company resulting in a fully functioning audit committee who will undertake the oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures; and ii) Preparing and implementing sufficient written policies and checklists which will set forth procedures for accounting and financial reporting with respect to the requirements and application of US GAAP and SEC disclosure requirements. Management believes that the appointment of one or more outside directors, who shall be appointed to a fully functioning audit committee, will remedy the lack of a functioning audit committee and a lack of a majority of outside directors on the Company's Board. In addition, management believes that preparing and implementing sufficient written policies and checklists will remedy the following material weaknesses (i) insufficient written policies and procedures for accounting and financial reporting with respect to the requirements and application of US GAAP and SEC disclosure requirements; and (ii) ineffective controls over period end financial close and reporting processes. Further, management believes that the hiring of additional personnel who have the technical expertise and knowledge will result proper segregation of duties and provide more checks and balances within the department. Additional personnel will also provide the cross training needed to support the Company if personnel turn over issues within the department occur. This coupled with the appointment of additional outside directors will greatly decrease any control and procedure issues the company may encounter in the future. We will continue to monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of our internal controls and procedures and our internal controls over financial reporting on an ongoing basis and are committed to taking further action and implementing additional enhancements or improvements, as necessary and as funds allow. This annual report does not include an attestation report of the company s registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management s report was not subject to attestation by the company s registered public accounting firm pursuant to temporary rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission that permit the Company to provide only management s report in this annual report. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Rules 13a-15 or 15d-15 under the Exchange Act that occurred during the small business issuer's last fiscal year that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
