PART I 

Item 1. Business 

Corporate History 

We
were originally incorporated in the state of Nevada on August 30, 2019, under the name Business Solutions Plus, Inc. 

On
August 30, 2019, Paul Moody was appointed Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, President, Secretary, Treasurer,
and Director. 

On
February 9, 2021, the Company filed, with the Secretary of State of Nevada NSOS ), Restated Articles of Incorporation. 

On
March 4, 2021, Business Solutions Plus, Inc., (the Company or Successor announced on Form 8-K plans to participate
in a holding company reorganization the Reorganization or Merger with InterActive Leisure Systems, Inc. IALS or Predecessor ), the Company and Business Solutions Merger Sub, Inc. Merger Sub ), collectively
(the Constituent Corporations pursuant to NRS 92A.180, NRS A.200, NRS 92A.230 and NRS 92A.250. 

Immediately
prior to the Reorganization, the Company was a direct and wholly owned subsidiary of Interactive Leisure Systems, Inc. and Business Solutions
Merger Sub, Inc. was a direct and wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. 

As
disclosed in our 8-K filed on March 26, 2021, the above-mentioned Reorganization was legally effective as of March 31, 2021. 

Each
share of Predecessor s common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time was converted into one validly
issued, fully paid and non-assessable share of Successor common stock. The control shareholder, (at the time) of the Predecessor, Flint
Consulting Services, LLC, Flint a Wyoming limited liability company became the same control shareholder of the Successor.
Jeffrey DeNunzio, as sole member of Flint is (was) deemed to be the indirect and beneficial holder of 405,516,868 shares of Common Stock
and 1,000,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock of the Company representing approximately 93.70 voting control of the Company. Paul
Moody, (our now former sole officer/director), was the same officer/director of the Predecessor. There are/were no other shareholders
or any officer/director holding at least 5 of the outstanding voting shares of the Company. 

 Immediately
prior to the Effective Time, and under the respective articles of incorporation of Predecessor and Successor, the Successor Capital Stock
had the same designations, rights, and powers and preferences, and the qualifications, limitations, and restrictions thereof, as the Predecessor
Capital Stock which was automatically converted pursuant to the reorganization. 

 Immediately
prior to the Effective Time, the articles of incorporation and bylaws of Successor, as the holding company, contain provisions identical
to the Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws of Predecessor immediately prior to the merger, other than as permitted by NRS 92A.200. 

 Immediately
prior to the Effective Time, the articles of incorporation of Predecessor stated that any act or transaction by or involving the Predecessor,
other than the election or removal of directors of the Predecessor, that requires for its adoption under the NRS or the Articles of Incorporation
of Predecessor the approval of the stockholders of the Predecessor, shall require in addition the approval of the stockholders of Successor
(or any successor thereto by merger), by the same vote as is required by the articles of Incorporation and/or the bylaws of the Predecessor. 

 Immediately
prior to the Effective Time, the articles of incorporation and bylaws of Successor and Merger Sub were identical to the articles of incorporation
and bylaws of Predecessor immediately prior to the merger, other than as permitted by NRS 92A.200; 

 The
Boards of Directors of Predecessor, Successor, and Merger Sub approved the Reorganization, shareholder approval not being required pursuant
to NRS 92A.180; 

 The
Reorganization constituted a tax-free organization pursuant to Section 368(a)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code; 

 Successor
common stock traded in the OTC Markets under the Predecessor ticker symbol IALS under which the common stock of Predecessor
previously listed and traded until the new ticker symbol BSPI was announced April 14, 2021, on the Financial Industry Regulatory
Authority s daily list with a market effective date of April 15, 2021. The CUSIP Number 45841W107 for IALS s common stock
was suspended upon market effectiveness. The Company received a new CUSIP Number 12330M107. 

 After
completion of the Holding Company Reorganization, the Company cancelled all of its stock held in Predecessor resulting in the Company
as a stand-alone and separate entity with no subsidiaries, no assets and negligible liabilities. The Company abandoned the business plan
of its Predecessor and resumed its former business plan of a blank check company after completion of the Merger. 

 On
May 4, 2021, Business Solutions Plus, Inc., a Nevada Corporation (the Company ), entered into a Share Purchase Agreement

approximately 93.70 voting control of the Company. WKC paid consideration of three hundred twenty-five thousand dollars 325,000) (the
 Purchase Price ). The consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Agreement resulted in a change in control of the
Company, with WKC becoming the Company s largest controlling stockholder.

WB
Burgers Japan Co., Ltd., referred to herein as WBJ , which we now operate through and share the same business plan of, holds
the rights to the Master Franchise Agreement with Jakes Franchising LLC, a Delaware Limited Liability
Company, as it pertains to the establishment and operation of Wayback Burger Restaurants within the country of Japan. 

The
Master Franchise Agreement provides WBJ the right to establish and operate Wayback Burgers restaurants in the country of Japan, and also
license affiliated and unaffiliated third parties Franchisees to establish and operate Wayback Burgers restaurants in
the Country of Japan. The Master Franchise Agreement, amongst other things, also provides WBJ the right of first refusal to
enter into a subsequent Master Franchise Agreement with Jake s Franchising, LLC to establish and operate Wayback Burgers restaurants
in the Countries of Indonesia, Malaysia (Eastern Malaysia only, Western Malaysia if it becomes available as it is currently licensed to
another party), the Philippines, Vietnam, China, India, Korea, Thailand, Singapore, and Taiwan. 

WB
Burgers Japan Co., Ltd. seeks to make Wayback Burgers a nationally recognized brand, if not a household name, within the
country of Japan through the promotion and opening of various Wayback Burgers Restaurants. Currently, it is negotiating a lease space
with Arai Co., Ltd., a Japanese realty group for the lease of a space it hopes to make its first Wayback Burgers location in the country
of Japan. Our current, and future plans are detailed in more specificity below beginning on page 6. 

Following the acquisition of our now wholly owned subsidiary, WB Burgers
Japan Co., Ltd., on September 14, 2021, we ceased to be a shell company. Immediately upon our acquisition of WB Burgers Japan Co., Ltd.
we adopted the same business plan as WB Burgers Japan Co., Ltd. 

On
October 22, 2021, we sold 2,252,252 shares of restricted common stock to Shokafulin LLP, a Japan Company, which is controlled by Takuya
Watanabe, a Japanese Citizen, at a price of 0.20 per share of common stock. The total subscription amount paid by Shokafulin LLP was
approximately 450,450 or approximately 50,000,000 Japanese Yen. Shokafulin LLP and Mr. Watanabe are not related parties to the Company. 

The
aforementioned sale of shares was conducted pursuant to Regulation S of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended ("Regulation S"). The sale
of shares was made only to non-U.S. persons (as defined under Rule 902 section (k)(2)(i) of Regulation S), pursuant to offshore transactions,
and no directed selling efforts were made in the United States by the issuer, a distributor, any of their respective affiliates, or any
person acting on behalf of any of the foregoing. 

Japanese
Food-Service Market 

The
Japanese Food-Service Market is Segmented by Type (Full-service Restaurants, Quick Service Restaurants, Cafes, Bars, 100 Home Delivery
Restaurants, Street Stalls and Kiosks) and Structure (Independent Consumer Food Service and Chained Consumer Food Service). We believe
Japanese consumers, in general, tend to be highly demanding, putting great emphasis on quality and branding and are willing to spend more
resources on value-added products. 

The
Japanese food service market was valued at USD 142.84 billion in 2020, and it is projected to witness a CAGR of 0.84 during the forecast
period, 2021 - 2026. The coronavirus pandemic has made short-term projections hard to predict, with sales in March 2020 down almost 40 
for some food companies. Japanese food service operators, which rely on lunch and dinner demand from business workers, are also suffering
as more companies have employees working from home at the government s request. 

According
to a report released by TableCheck Inc., the percentage of reservations (dining reservations) being canceled increased about 3.6 times
before the pandemic for groups of 10 or more. A French restaurant and bar named Scene near Hachioji Station on the Keio Line, earlier
in June 2020, launched take-out and delivery services which we believe many others will begin offering if not already, due in part to
the changing attitudes of dining out as a result of the ongoing pandemic. We believe take-out and delivery services, along with menu options
that are quick to prepare, increasing in consumer demand. 

The
variety of restaurants and menu items available in the Japanese food service industry continues to expand in the country, as Japanese
consumers are interested in trying a new and vast variety of cuisines, which are available at their convenience in Japan. Food from Europe,
Asia, Australia, and the Americas are becoming increasingly popular, partly due to a large number of Japanese traveling abroad every year. 

The
Japanese food service market is highly competitive, with a major market share held by prominent companies, such as McDonald s Corporation,
Yum! Brands Inc., Zensho Holdings Co. Ltd, Skylark Group, MOS Food Services Inc., and Yoshinoya Holdings Co. Ltd. Zensho Holdings Co.
Ltd, with the largest market share of 2.76 in 2020, emerging as the market leader, and Skylark Group holding the second-largest share
with 1.66 . 

Currently,
in the Japanese market, hamburgers and related fast-food options have been prevalent, with high-end gourmet hamburgers being in the most
expensive category consisting usually of single restaurant locations, followed by lesser expensive hamburger options via chain restaurants
such as Shake Shack and MOS Premiums. The size of the current market for hamburgers in Japan is approximately 6.6 Billion (2020), and
has been steadily increasing ever since 2015. It is also projected to grow by approximately 5 over the next few years. Hamburgers are
considered to be one of the few food categories that were not affected by COVID-19 in Japan and were able to take advantage of home deliveries
and to-go orders during the pandemic. (Source: Fuji Keizai Group 2020.)

thirty years ago in 1991, offering a combination of burgers, hot dogs, fries, milkshakes, and other similar menu options. Since then,
it has reached a global scale with a presence in the US, Europe, Africa, and Asia with hundreds of corporate owned restaurants and over
five hundred franchise locations worldwide offering much of the same comfort items many have grown accustomed to, with the addition of
a few menu items specifically geared toward the pallets of those in various demographics. 

The
products we seek to offer in our anticipated location(s), and those we seek to franchise to within Japan, will also offer many of the
same product offerings many are accustomed to elsewhere such as hamburgers, hot dogs chicken sandwiches, hand-dipped milkshakes, various
side dishes, fresh salad, kid s meals, refreshing drinks and alcoholic beverages. We intend to source our ingredients in any of
our future location(s) from highly regarded local Japanese suppliers in order to satisfy the food quality standards as set by Wayback
Burgers Inc., within the United States. 

Our
First Location 

Currently,
we are negotiating a lease space with Arai Co., Ltd., a Japanese realty group for the lease of a space we hope to make our first
Wayback Burgers location in the country of Japan. Negotiations are ongoing, but we are presently nearing a finalized agreement
pending a few minor alterations. The property is located in the popular shopping plaza of Omotesando located in the Tokyo
prefecture. We believe the high volume of foot traffic and shopping will yield a large group of patrons seeking to try our product
offerings. Currently, we have inspected the property in detail and are in discussions with the local fire department as to what is
needed to bring the space up to code in respect to a restaurant that can house upwards of several hundred patrons at a time. We are
also in discussions with Arai Co., Ltd. regarding what measures need to be taken to create handicap accessible areas and to improve
upon existing structures that had been put in place by the previous tenant. 

We
are also in the midst of conversations with the adjacent apartment complex as it pertains to volume restrictions and patrons dining outside
during nighttime hours. Currently, the adjacent apartment complex has tentatively agreed to allow guests of our proposed restaurant to
dine outside through 9:30pm however, we d prefer it be 10:00pm. These and many other factors are in flux, and the fact they are
in flux is the reason we have not yet signed the lease with Arai Co., Ltd. although, we do anticipate hashing out such details and moving
forward within the next month. If, we are not able to secure this particular space, we will seek out a comparable space, also
in what we believe to be a high traffic area in Tokyo. 

Below
is a photograph of the space we seek to lease from Arai Co., Ltd. (second floor). Logos and branding of neighboring business have been
blurred out in the below image. 

Once
we are able to secure and sign a lease for our initial restaurant space, we seek to open within a few months thereafter once we are able
to hire qualified staff. Currently, we have already vetted out and pre-emptively hired various employees such as line cooks and other
workers for when we do open our first location. We believe we will need to hire approximately 11 employees to efficiently operate our
first restaurant location. Our personnel plan calls for a minimum of one store manager, licensed to cook, with the ability to manage between
eight to ten employees. We will require that our store manager has the requisite training and skillset to take spearhead breakfast and
dinner menu creation, as well as procurement and cost vs profit calculations. The eight to ten employees will be a combination of full-time
and part-time employees who will operate our flagship store between the hours of 7:00 am to 11:00 pm. Specialized training for our staff
will include, but not strictly be limited to, food preparation, cooking, POS (point of sale) operations, sanitation, etc.

Marketing
Strategy 

In
order to grow an initial customer base, from which we intend to launch future expansion efforts, our marketing strategy begins with the
physical location of our flagship restaurant. Our plan, at present, is to select a suitable location in an area of Omotesando with high
foot-traffic that can serve to attract not only customers, but also future franchisee prospects throughout Japan. For future franchisee
locations, we intend to identify areas where competitors are not already located, such as road-side in the outskirts of major cities,
and open our restaurants in these areas. 

However,
we do not intend to rely solely on physical location in order to attract customers, we also are in the development stages of a robust
marketing stratagem comprised, in part, of SNS (social networking service) marketing through collaboration with influencers and celebrities,
magazine advertisements, and expansive television and media appearances. The specifics of these marketing initiatives are in the planning
stages and have not yet been determined in sufficient detail to disclose in their entirety. 

Wayback
Burgers in Japan intends to position itself as a newly entered and authentic American hamburger brand, comparable to our competitor Shack
Shake, while contrasting ourselves through offering higher quality foods at comparable price points. We plan to achieve this by focusing
on the ingredients, such as the option of vegetables in our hamburgers, the increased diameter of our meat patties, and the overall volume
of our menu items. Additionally, we intend to offer original Japanese breakfast and dinner menu options, as well as forming a special
collaboration focused on all-plant based alternative foods with Next Meats, Co., Ltd., a Japanese alternative meat company. 

Expansion
Plans 

We
have forecasted our expansion plans, as depicted in the image above, over the next few years. However, when our operations commence,
we may find that our plans may be materially altered, expanded, or curtailed as dictated by market forces at the time. As such, our expansion
plans should be read as a framework for our future goals, but not a guarantee that we will carry out any or all such operations in the
indicated timeline. 

At
present our expansion plans are as follows: 

-
We are currently in the midst of negotiating a lease agreement for our fist location, currently planned for Omotesando which will be within
shopping range of Aoyama and Hajajuku. During this period of time we are also seeking to hire the necessary staff (approximately 11 employees)
to manage and operate our flagship location. 

-
We anticipate that hiring will continue into November, during which time training of staff will remain ongoing and the flagship location
will continue to prepare for its forthcoming grand opening. 

-
In mid-December we aim to open our first flagship restaurant location in Omotesando, Tokyo. 

-
Over the course of 2022, we are aiming to open five Wayback Burgers restaurants throughout Japan, with one of these restaurants directly
managed by us while the remaining four would ideally be franchise locations. This number may increase or decrease depending on the results
of our operations.- 

-
Additionally, during 2022, we intend to execute another master franchise agreement in Asia for the right to open Wayback Burgers restaurants
in another Asian country or territory. We have not yet identified which country or territory we will seek to acquire these rights for
first. As noted previously, we have the right of first refusal to enter into a subsequent Master Franchise Agreement with Jake s
Franchising, LLC to establish and operate Wayback Burgers restaurants in the Countries of Indonesia, Malaysia (Eastern Malaysia only,
Western Malaysia if it becomes available as it is currently licensed to another party), the Philippines, Vietnam, China, India, Korea,
Thailand, Singapore, and Taiwan. 

- By the year 2023, we intend for there to be ten Wayback Burgers Franchise locations open throughout Japan. We also intend, during
2023, to execute two additional Master Franchise Agreements in Asia to establish and operate Wayback Burgers restaurant locations in additional
Asian countries or territories. 

 Partnerships 

The
company believes partnerships are a vital means to expansion and that partnerships with other food institutions or distributors may allow
the Company to provide menu items that might appeal to a larger demographic within the Japanese market.

Table of Contents 

Our
current officer and Director, Koichi Ishizuka has existing ties and relationships with Next Meats Co., Ltd. a Japanese alternative
meat company, that produces and sells lab grown and meat alternatives to consumers. Additionally, we may explore the possibility of
entering into an agreement with Dr. Foods, Inc., a company in the alternative meat industry which has common
management with the Company. It is the Company s goal that it will be able to integrate such alternative meat options into its
menu, and potentially create customized menu options as provided by Next Meats Co., Ltd. Menu alterations are subject to approval by
Jake s Franchising, LLC. It is the belief of the management that such offerings can gain a larger market share in the country
of Japan allowing for greater growth potential. Of course, this is speculative and such plans may not materialize. It is also
possible that if such plans do materialize, they may not result in the expected level of growth the Company forecasts as a result of
the partnership or partnerships it enters into. 

It
should be noted that Koichi ishizuka has an equity interest in Next Meats Co., Ltd. He also currently serves as Chief Financial Officer
of Next Meats Holdings, Inc., a Nevada Company, that has entered into an agreement to acquire Next Meats Co., Ltd. pending various conditions
be met. 

Government
Regulations 

The
below does not extensively detail every single law and regulation to which the Company may be subject to, but rather provides an overview
of the kind of food safety standards to which our restaurant(s) will be held. 

The
main law that governs food quality and integrity in Japan is the Food Sanitation Act ("FSA") and the law that comprehensively governs
food labelling regulation is the Food Labelling Act. 

The
FSA regulates food quality and integrity by: 

-
Establishing standards and specifications for food, additives, apparatus, and food containers and packaging; 

 -
Providing for inspection to see whether the established standards are met; 

 -
Providing for hygiene management in the manufacture and sale of food; and 

 -
Requiring food businesses to be licensed. 

Under
the FSA, additives and foods containing additives must not be sold, or be produced, imported, processed, used, stored, or displayed for
marketing purposes unless the Minister of Health, Labour and Welfare ("MHLW") has declared them as having no risk to human health after
seeking the views of the Pharmaceutical Affairs and Food Sanitation Council ("PAFSC"). In addition, it is not permissible to add any processing
aids, vitamins, minerals, novel foods or nutritive substances to food unless they have been expressly declared by the MHLW as having no
risk to human health. 

The
MHLW may establish specifications for methods of producing, processing, using, cooking, or preserving food or additives to be served to
the public for marketing purposes ("Specifications"), or may establish standards for food ingredients or additives to be served to the
public for marketing purposes ("Standards") pursuant to the FSA. Accordingly, where substances are allowed to be added to food, they may
only be used within the limits expressly set by the Specifications and Standards.

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

As
of July 31, 2021, and 2020, we had cash and cash equivalents in the amount of 1,818,192 and 0, respectively. The variance in our cash
balance from July 31, 2020 to July 31, 2021 is the result of the Company having secured an investment during our 2021 fiscal year.

or any person acting on behalf of any of the foregoing. 

As
indicated above, subsequent to our fiscal year ended July 31, 2021, we have secured additional investments and believe that our current
cash balance is sufficient to cover our ongoing operating costs given our current demands, however, in order to fully fulfill our business
plan, we may require further funding. The exact amount of funding that we may need to fully implement our plan of operations going forward,
has not yet been fully determined. We may seek to borrow funds as may be necessary from our management, however, there is no formal commitment,
arrangement or legal obligation for management to advance or loan funds to the company.

The

capital. 

The
Company s former sole officer and director, Paul Moody, paid expenses on behalf of the company totaling 1,074 during the period
ended July 31, 2020. 

The
 1,074 in total payments are considered contributions to the company with no expectation of repayment and are posted as additional paid-in
capital. 

Revenues 

For the year ended July 31, 2021, and 2020, we generated
no revenue. Prior to our acquisition of WB Burgers Japan Co., Ltd. we had yet to commence material operations. 

Net Loss 

We recorded a net loss of 126,113 and 2,074 for
the year ended July 31, 2021, and 2020, respectively. The greater net loss for the year ended July 31, 2021, as opposed to the year ended
July 30, 2020, is attributed to an increase in general and administrative expenses coupled with share-based compensation. 

At this point in time we cannot forecast, with any
level of specificity, if we will experience a net loss or income going forward, and if so to what extent, as it will depend in large
part upon the progression of our developing business objectives. 

Notable Events On
September 14, 2021, following our fiscal year ended July 31, 2021, we acquired 100 of the equity interest of WB Burgers Japan Co., Ltd.,

Report
 of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 

 To the shareholders and the board of directors
of WB Burgers Asia, Inc. 

 Opinion on the Financial Statements 

 We have audited the accompanying balance
sheets of WB Burgers Asia, Inc. as of July 31, 2021 and 2020, the related statements of operations, stockholders' equity (deficit), and
cash flows for the years then ended, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements ). In our
opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of July 31, 2021
and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States. 

 Substantial Doubt about the Company s
Ability to Continue as a Going Concern 

 The accompanying financial statements
have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 3 to the financial statements, the
Company has suffered recurring losses from operations and has a significant accumulated deficit. In addition, the Company continues to
experience negative cash flows from operations. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going
concern. Management's plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 3. The financial statements do not include any adjustments
that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

 Basis for Opinion 

 These financial statements are the responsibility
of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audit. We
are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) PCAOB and are
required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and
regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

 We conducted our audit in accordance with
the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were
we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an
understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the
Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

 Our audit included performing procedures
to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that
respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

which resulted in a net operating loss for income tax purposes. The
loss results in a deferred tax asset of approximately at the effective statutory rate of 21 . The deferred tax asset has been offset
by an equal valuation allowance. Given our inception on August 30, 2019, and our fiscal year end of July 31, 2020, we have completed two
taxable fiscal years of July 31, 2021. 

 Potential benefits of income tax losses are not recognized in the accounts
until realization is more likely than not. In assessing the realization of
deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will
be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods
in which those temporary differences become deductible. The Company has incurred a net operating loss carryforward of which
begins expiring in 2036. The Company has adopted ASC 740, Accounting for Income Taxes , as of its inception. Pursuant to
ASC 740 the Company is required to compute tax asset benefits for non-capital losses carried forward. The potential benefit of the net
operating loss has not been recognized in these financial statements because the Company cannot be assured it is more likely than not
it will utilize the loss carried forward in future years. 

Due to the change in ownership provisions of the
Tax Reform Act of 1986, net operating loss carryforwards for Federal income tax reporting purposes are subject to annual limitations.
Should a change in ownership occur, net operating loss carryforwards may be limited as to use in future years.

considered contributions to the company with no expectation of repayment and are posted as additional paid-in capital.

JAPAN CO. LTD. 

 NOTES TO
THE UNAUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

 FOR THE
PERIOD April 14, 2021 (INCEPTION) TO JULY 31, 2021 

Note 1 - Organization and Description of Business 

WB Burgers Japan Co. Ltd. (the Company, 
the Registrant, we, us, or our ), was incorporated on April 14, 2021, in Tokyo,
Japan. 

Description of Business 

The purpose of the Company shall be to engage in the
following business activities: 

1. Provide service businesses such as restaurants
that serve processed foods, coffee, and tea; 

2. Recruitment for franchise restaurants and management
of franchise restaurants and providing guidance through the franchise system; 

3. Manufacturing, processing, and sales of various
foodstuffs, seasonings, high-end food products, beverages, etc. 

4. Manufacturing and delivery of lunch boxes, ready-made
meals, and other processed foods; 

The main office of the Company is located in Minato
Ward, Tokyo, Japan. 

The Company s fiscal year-end is May 31 st . 

Recent Developments 

In
January 2020, the World Health Organization (the WHO announced a global health emergency because of a new strain of coronavirus COVID-19 originating in Wuhan, China and the risks to the international community as the virus spread globally beyond
its point of origin. In March 2020, the WHO classified the COVID-19 outbreak as a pandemic based on the rapid increase in global exposure. 

Our
operations have not been significantly impacted. No impairments were recorded as of July 31, 2021 and no triggering events or changes
in circumstances had occurred. However, the full impact of the COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve subsequent to the period ended July
31, 2021 and as of the date these financial statements are issued. As such, the full magnitude of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the resulting
impact, if any, on the Company s financial condition, liquidity, and future results of operations is uncertain. Management is actively
monitoring the global situation on our financial condition, liquidity, operations, suppliers, industry, and customers. Reduced demand
for products or impaired ability to meet customer demand (including as a result of disruptions at the Company s suppliers) could
have a material adverse effect on its business operations and financial performance. Given the daily evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic
and the global responses to curb its spread, the Company is not presently able to estimate the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on its
results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity for the current fiscal year. As of the date of this filing, the Company s
recently commenced business operations have not been impacted. 

Note 2 - Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting
Policies 

 Basis of Presentation 

This summary of significant accounting policies
is presented to assist in understanding the Company's financial statements. These accounting policies conform to accounting principles,
generally accepted in the United States of America US GAAP and have been consistently applied in the preparation of the
financial statements. 

Income Tax 

Income taxes are provided for the tax effects of transactions
reported in the financial statements and consist of taxes currently due plus deferred taxes related primarily to differences between the
recorded book basis and the tax basis of assets and liabilities for financial and income tax reporting. Deferred tax assets and liabilities
represent the future tax return consequences of those differences, which will either be taxable or deductible when the assets and liabilities
are recovered or settled. Deferred taxes are also recognized for operating losses that are available to offset future taxable income and
tax credits that are available to offset future federal income taxes. The Company believes that its income tax filing positions and deductions
will be sustained on audit and does not anticipate any adjustments that will result in a material adverse effect on the Company s
financial condition, results of operations, or cash flow. Therefore, no reserves for uncertain income tax positions have been recorded
pursuant to ASC 740. 

Fair Value of Financial Instruments 

 The Company s balance sheet includes
certain financial instruments. The carrying amounts of current assets and current liabilities approximate their fair value because of
the relatively short period of time between the origination of these instruments and their expected realization. 

 ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures ASC
820 ), defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price)
in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement
date. ASC 820 also establishes a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between (1) market participant assumptions developed based
on market data obtained from independent sources (observable inputs) and (2) an entity s own assumptions about market participant
assumptions developed based on the best information available in the circumstances (unobservable inputs). The fair value hierarchy consists
of three broad levels, which gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities
(Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below: 

Level 1 Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities. 

Level 2 Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, including quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability (e.g., interest rates); and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means. 

Level 3 - Inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable. 

Fair value estimates discussed herein are based upon
certain market assumptions and pertinent information available to management as of July 31, 2021. The respective carrying value of certain
on-balance-sheet financial instruments approximated their fair values due to the short-term nature of these instruments. These financial
instruments include accrued expenses. 

Share-Based Compensation 

The Company measures the cost of services received
in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the fair value of the award. For employees and directors and non-employees, the
fair value of the award is measured on the grant date. The fair value amount is then recognized over the period during which services
are required to be provided in exchange for the award, usually the vesting period. 

The Company s stock-based compensation for the period ended July
31, 2021 was 0. 

Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements 

 The
Company has adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB Accounting Standards Codification ASC Topic 350 provides guidance on financial accounting and reporting related to franchise rights and other intangibles for U.S. GAAP. Per
ASC 350, originally issued as Financial Accounting Standards No. 142 in June 2001 and subsequently updated by Accounting Standards Update ASU 2010-28, franchise rights are not amortized, but tested for impairment at the reporting unit level (the operating
segment or one level below). Under the rules, if conditions exist that it is more likely than not that fair value of reporting
unit is less than its carrying value, then a two-step impairment test is performed to identify potential franchise rights impairment
and measure the amount of loss to be recognized (if any). This franchise rights impairment test is required at least annually, or more
frequently if certain events occur and circumstances change. No impairments were recorded
as of July 31, 2021. Management determined that there has been no significant reduction in the fair market value of the franchise rights
and no triggering events or changes in circumstances had occurred to require an impairment test. 

 Note 3 - Going Concern 

 The Company s
financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP applicable to a going concern that contemplates the realization of assets and
liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company considered its going concern disclosure requirements in accordance
with ASC 240-40-50. 

 The Company did not generate any revenue during the period ended
July 31, 2021. Management plans to fund operating expenses with related party loans until the Company realizes sufficient revenue to cover
operating expenses. There is no assurance that management's plan will be successful. 

The financial statements do not include any adjustments relating
to the recoverability and classification of recorded assets, or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary
if the Company cannot continue as a going concern. 

Note
4 - Income Tax 

The
Company has not recognized an income tax benefit for its operating losses generated based on uncertainties concerning its ability to
generate taxable income in future periods. The tax benefit for the period presented is offset by a valuation allowance established against
deferred tax assets arising from the net operating losses, the realization of which could not be considered more likely than not. In
future periods, tax benefits and related deferred tax assets will be recognized when management considers realization of such amounts
to be more likely than not. As of April 30, 2021, the Company has incurred a net loss of approximately 70,167 which resulted in a net
operating loss for income tax purposes. The loss results in a deferred tax asset of approximately 14,735 at the effective statutory
rate of 21 . The deferred tax asset has been offset by an equal valuation allowance. Given our inception on April 14, 2021, and our fiscal
year end of May 31, 2021, we have completed only one taxable fiscal year. 

Note
5 - Commitments and Contingencies 

The Company follows ASC 450-20, Los s Contingencies, to
report accounting for contingencies. Liabilities for loss contingencies arising from claims, assessments, litigation, fines and
penalties and other sources are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the assessment can be
reasonably estimated. There were no commitments or contingencies as of July 31, 2021, other than the below: 

On April 14, 2021, the Company entered into a Master
Franchise Agreement with Jake s Franchising, LLC Franchisor in order to be set up as a Way Back Burger franchisee
in Japan. At this time a non-refundable deposit of 100,000 was made to the Franchisor on behalf of the Company by related party, White
Knight Co., Ltd White Knight ). White Knight is controlled by our sole director, Koichi Ishizuka. The remainder of the franchise
fee, 2,600,000, was paid in full by White Knight on behalf of the Company on June 9, 2021.

 Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with
Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure. 

None. 

Item 9A. Controls and Procedures. 

Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

The Company has adopted and maintains disclosure
controls and procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in the reports
filed under the Exchange Act, such as this annual report, is collected, recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
periods specified in the rules of the SEC. The Company s disclosure controls and procedures are also designed to ensure
that such information is accumulated and communicated to management to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
 As required under Exchange Act Rule 13a-15, the Company s management, including the Company s Chief Executive
Officer who also serves as our Principal Financial Officer, has conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of disclosure controls
and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Office who also
serves as our Principal Financial Officer, concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures are ineffective. 

Our Chief
Executive Officer, Koichi Ishizuka, has reviewed the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules
13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by the report July 31, 2021 and has concluded that
(i) the Company s disclosure controls and procedures are not effective to ensure that material information relating to the
Company is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the Commission,
and (ii) the Company s controls and procedures have not been designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by
the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Company's
management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as
appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

The Company s management is responsible
for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f).
 The Company s internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance to the Company s
management and board of directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements. Management
conducted an assessment of the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on the framework and criteria established
by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control Integrated Framework. Based
on the assessment, management concluded that, as of July 31, 2021, the Company s internal control over financial reporting
is ineffective based on those criteria. 

The Company s management, including
its Chief Executive Officer, who also serves as our Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that the Company s disclosure
controls and procedures and its internal control processes will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter
how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system
are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits
of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation
of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of error or fraud, if any, within the Company
have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and
that the breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual
acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the control. The design of any system
of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance
that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, controls may
become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
 Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and
may not be detected. However, these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process. Therefore,
it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce, though not eliminate, this risk. 

The matters involving internal controls and
procedures that our Chief Executive Officer considered to be material weaknesses under the standards of the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of Treadway Commission were: domination of management by a single individual without adequate compensating controls,
lack of a majority of outside directors on board of directors, resulting in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring
of required internal controls and procedures; inadequate segregation of duties consistent with control objectives, and lack of
an audit committee. 

The Company believes that the material
weaknesses are due to the Company s limited resources and early stages of development, which have not allowed enough time for
the Company to remedy any such weaknesses. 

Our Chief Executive Officer believes that the
material weaknesses did not have an effect on our financial results. However, management believes that the lack of a functioning
audit committee and inadequate segregation of duties results in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of
required internal controls and procedures, which could result in a material misstatement in our financial statements in future
periods. 

Our Chief Executive Officer recognizes that
its controls and procedures would be substantially improved if we had an audit committee and or two individuals serving as officers,
and as such, is actively seeking to remediate this issue. 

Management s Remediation Initiatives 

In an effort to remediate the identified material weaknesses and
other deficiencies and enhance our internal controls, we have initiated, or plan to initiate, the following series of measures: 

We intend to create a position to segregate duties consistent with
control objectives and will increase our personnel resources and technical accounting expertise within the accounting function when
funds are available to us. Furthermore, we plan to appoint one or more outside directors to our board of directors who shall be appointed to
an audit committee resulting in a fully functioning audit committee who will undertake the oversight in the establishment and
monitoring of required internal controls and procedures such as reviewing and approving estimates and assumptions made by management
when funds are available to us. 

Management believes that the appointment of one or more outside directors,
who shall be appointed to a fully functioning audit committee, will remedy the lack of a functioning audit committee and a lack of a
majority of outside directors on our Board. 

We will work as quickly as possible to implement these initiatives however,
the early stages of our current development, and other business initiatives will likely slow this implementation or divert our attention. 

Auditor s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

This Report does not include an attestation report of our independent registered
public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management s report was not subject to attestation by our
independent registered public accounting firm pursuant to the rules of the SEC that permit us to provide only management s report in this
Report. 

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

There have been no changes in our internal control over financial
reporting (as that term is defined in Rules 13(a)-15(f) and 15(d)-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that have occurred during the fourth
quarter ended July 31, 2021, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal
control over financial reporting.

Mr. Koichi Ishizuka, Age 50 - Chief

2021, Mr. Koichi Ishiukza was appointed as the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, President, Secretary, Treasurer, and
Director of Business Solutions Plus, Inc., which is now known as WB Burgers Asia, Inc. 

As of the date of this filing, there has not
been any material plan, contract, or arrangement (whether or not written) to which our sole officer and director are a party in
connection with their appointments at WB Burgers Asia, Inc. 

Employees 

As of July 31, 2021, we, WB Burgers Asia,
Inc., had no employees outside of our sole officer and director. 

Director s Term of Office 

Our current Director holds office until the next
annual meeting of our stockholders or until his successor has been elected and qualified, or until his death,
resignation, or removal. Our executive officers are appointed by our Board and hold office until their death, resignation, or
removal from office. 

Corporate Governance 

The Company promotes accountability for adherence
to honest and ethical conduct; endeavors to provide full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in reports and
documents that the Company files with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC and in other public communications
made by the Company; and strives to be compliant with applicable governmental laws, rules and regulations. The Company has not
formally adopted a written code of business conduct and ethics that governs the Company s employees, officers and Directors
as the Company is not required to do so. 

In lieu of an Audit Committee, the Company s
Board of Directors, is responsible for reviewing and making recommendations concerning the selection of outside auditors, reviewing
the scope, results and effectiveness of the annual audit of the Company's financial statements and other services provided by
the Company s independent public accountants. Our sole officer and Director reviews the Company's internal accounting controls,
practices, and policies. 

Committees of the Board 

Our Company currently does not have nominating, compensation,
or audit committees or committees performing similar functions nor does our Company have a written nominating, compensation or audit
committee charter. Currently, our sole officer and Director is performing the functions of such committees. 

Audit Committee Financial Expert 

Our Board has determined that we do not have
a board member that qualifies as an audit committee financial expert as defined in Item 407(D)(5) of Regulation
S-K, nor do we have a Board member that qualifies as independent as the term is used in Item 7(d)(3)(iv)(B) of Schedule
14A under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and as defined by Rule 4200(a)(14) of the FINRA Rules. 

We believe that our sole Director is currently capable
of analyzing and evaluating our financial statements and understanding internal controls and procedures for financial reporting. 

Involvement in Certain Legal Proceedings 

Our sole officer and director has not been
involved in any of the following events during the past ten years: 

1. 
 bankruptcy petition filed by or against any business
 of which such person was a general partner or executive officer either at the time of the bankruptcy or within two years prior
 to that time; 
 
 2. 
 any conviction in a criminal proceeding or being subject to
 a pending criminal proceeding (excluding traffic violations and other minor offenses); 
 
 3. 
 being subject to any order, judgment, or decree, not subsequently
 reversed, suspended or vacated, of any court of competent jurisdiction, permanently or temporarily enjoining, barring, suspending
 or otherwise limiting his/her involvement in any type of business, securities or banking activities; or 
 
 4. 
 being found by a court of competent jurisdiction (in a civil
 action), the Commission or the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to have violated a federal or state securities or commodities
 law, and the judgment has not been reversed, suspended, or vacated. 
 
 5. 
 Such person was found by a court of competent jurisdiction in
 a civil action or by the Commission to have violated any Federal or State securities law, and the judgment in such civil action
 or finding by the Commission has not been subsequently reversed, suspended, or vacated; 
 
 6. 
 Such person was found by a court of competent jurisdiction in
 a civil action or by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to have violated any Federal commodities law, and the judgment
 in such civil action or finding by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission has not been subsequently reversed, suspended
 or vacated; 
 
 7. 
 Such person was the subject of, or a party to, any Federal or
 State judicial or administrative order, judgment, decree, or finding, not subsequently reversed, suspended or vacated, relating
 to an alleged violation of:(i) Any Federal or State securities or commodities law or regulation; or(ii) Any law or regulation
 respecting financial institutions or insurance companies including, but not limited to, a temporary or permanent injunction,
 order of disgorgement or restitution, civil money penalty or temporary or permanent cease-and-desist order, or removal or
 prohibition order; or(iii) Any law or regulation prohibiting mail or wire fraud or fraud in connection with any business entity;
 or 
 
 8. 
 Such person was the subject of, or a party to, any sanction
 or order, not subsequently reversed, suspended or vacated, of any self-regulatory organization (as defined in Section 3(a)(26)
 of the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(26))), any registered entity (as defined in Section 1(a)(29) of the Commodity Exchange
 Act (7 U.S.C. 1(a)(29))), or any equivalent exchange, association, entity or organization that has disciplinary authority
 over its members or persons associated with a member. 

Independence of Directors 

We are not required to have independent members of
our Board of Directors, and currently we do not have any independent Directors. 

Code of Ethics 

We have not adopted a formal Code of Ethics.
The Board of Directors evaluated the business of the Company and the number of employees and determined that since the business
is operated by a small number of persons, general rules of fiduciary duty and federal and state criminal, business conduct and
securities laws are adequate ethical guidelines. In the event our operations, employees and/or Directors expand in the future,
we may take actions to adopt a formal Code of Ethics. 

Shareholder Proposals 

Our Company does not have any defined policy
or procedural requirements for shareholders to submit recommendations or nominations for Directors. The Board of Directors believes
that, given the stage of our development, a specific nominating policy would be premature and of little assistance until our business
operations develop to a more advanced level. Our Company does not currently have any specific or minimum criteria for the election
of nominees to the Board of Directors and we do not have any specific process or procedure for evaluating such nominees. The Board
of Directors will assess all candidates, whether submitted by management or shareholders, and make recommendations for election
or appointment. 

A shareholder who wishes to communicate with
our Board of Directors may do so by directing a written request addressed to our President, at the address appearing on the first
page of this Registration Statement.
