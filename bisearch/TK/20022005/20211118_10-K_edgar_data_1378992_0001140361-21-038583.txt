 (In millions of dollars, except as otherwise noted)

General

Berry Global Group, Inc. Berry, we, or the Company is a leading global supplier of a broad range of innovative rigid, flexible and non-woven products used every day within consumer and industrial end markets. We sell our products predominantly into stable, consumer-oriented end markets, such as healthcare, personal care, and food and beverage. Our customers consist of a diverse mix of leading global, national, mid-sized regional and local specialty businesses. The size and scope of our customer network allows us to introduce new products we develop or acquire to a vast audience that is familiar with our business. For the fiscal year ended October 2, 2021 fiscal 2021 ), no single customer represented more than 5 of net sales and our top ten customers represented 15 of net sales. We believe our manufacturing processes, manufacturing footprint and our ability to leverage our scale to reduce costs, positions us as a low-cost manufacturer relative to our competitors.

Additional financial information about our segments is provided in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which are included elsewhere in this Form 10-K.

Segment Overview

The Company s operations are organized into four reporting segments: Consumer Packaging International, Consumer Packaging North America, Engineered Materials, and Health, Hygiene Specialties. The structure is designed to align us with our customers, provide improved service, drive future growth, and to facilitate synergies realization.

Consumer Packaging International

 The Consumer Packaging International segment is a manufacturer of rigid products that primarily services non-North American markets. Product groups within the segment include Closures and Dispensing Systems, Pharmaceutical Devices and Packaging, Bottles and Canisters, Containers, and Technical Components. In fiscal 2021, Consumer Packaging International accounted for 30 of our consolidated net sales.

Consumer Packaging North America

 The Consumer Packaging North America segment is a manufacturer of rigid products that primarily services North American markets. Product groups within the segment include Containers and Pails, Foodservice, Closures and Overcaps, Bottles and Prescription Vials, and Tubes. In fiscal 2021, Consumer Packaging North America accounted for 23 of our consolidated net sales.

Engineered Materials

 The Engineered Materials segment is a manufacturer of flexible products that services primarily North American and European markets. Product groups within the segment include Stretch and Shrink Films, Converter Films, Institutional Can Liners, Food and Consumer Films, Retail Bags, and Agriculture Films. In fiscal 2021, Engineered Materials accounted for 24 of our consolidated net sales.

Health, Hygiene Specialties

 The Health, Hygiene Specialties segment is a manufacturer of non-woven and related products that services global markets. Product groups within the segment include Healthcare, Hygiene, Specialties, and Tapes. In fiscal 2021, Health, Hygiene Specialties accounted for 23 of our consolidated net sales.

Marketing, Sales, and Competition

We reach our large and diversified customer base through a direct sales force of dedicated professionals and the strategic use of distributors. Our scale enables us to dedicate certain sales and marketing efforts to particular products or customers, when applicable, which enables us to develop expertise that we believe is valued by our customers.

The major markets in which the Company sells its products are highly competitive. Areas of competition include service, innovation, quality, and price. This competition is significant as to both the size and the number of competing firms. Competitors include but are not limited to Amcor, Silgan, Aptar, Pactiv Evergreen, 3M, and Fitesa.

3 

Raw Materials

Our primary raw material is polymer resin. In addition, we use other materials such as butyl rubber, adhesives, paper and packaging materials, linerboard, rayon, polyester fiber, and foil, in various manufacturing processes. While temporary industry-wide shortages of raw materials have occurred, we have historically been able to manage the supply chain disruption by working closely with our suppliers and customers. Supply shortages can lead to increased raw material price volatility, which we experienced in fiscal 2021. Increases in the price of raw materials are generally able to be passed on to customers through contractual price mechanisms over time and other means. We expect supply chain challenges to continue into fiscal 2022 and will continue to work closely with our suppliers and customers in an effort to minimize any impact.

Patents, Trademarks and Other Intellectual Property

We customarily seek patent and trademark protection for our products and brands while seeking to protect our proprietary know-how. While important to our business in the aggregate, sales of any one individually patented product is not considered material to any specific segment or the consolidated results.

Environmental and Sustainability

We focus our sustainability efforts on product stewardship, operational excellence, human capital management and community engagement. We believe there will always be a leading role for Berry s product offerings due to our ability to promote customer brands by providing superior clarity, protection, design versatility, consumer safety, convenience, cost efficiency, barrier properties, and environmental performance. Sustainability is comprehensively embedded across our business, from how we run our manufacturing operations more efficiently to the investments we are making in sustainable packaging innovation. We collaborate with customers, suppliers, and innovators to create industry-leading solutions which offer lighter weight products, enable longer shelf-life, and protect products throughout supply chains.

We believe responsible packaging is the answer to achieving less waste and that responsible packaging requires four things - innovative design, continued development of renewable and advanced raw materials, waste management infrastructure, and consumer participation. Berry is committed to responsible packaging and has (1) targeted 100 reusable, recyclable, or compostable packaging by 2025, (2) significantly increased our use of circular materials by entering into offtake agreements for both mechanically recycled and advanced recycled materials as well as expanded our own recycling operations in North America and Europe in order to meet our targeted 30 circular materials by 2030, and (3) worked to drive greater recycling rates around the world. With our global scale, deep industry experience, and strong capabilities, we are uniquely positioned to lead the way in the design and development of more sustainable packaging. 

We also work globally on continuous improvement of employee safety and engagement, energy usage, water efficiency, waste reduction, recycling as well as reducing our Green House Gas (GHG) emissions. Our teams are dedicated to improving the circularity and reducing the carbon footprint of our products. We anticipate higher demand for products with lower emissions intensity where polymer resins based products are inherently well positioned since they typically have lower GHG emissions per functional unit compared to heavier alternatives such as paper, metal and glass. Additionally, there is also significant work being done on the use of recycled and bio content, which has lower associated GHG emissions compared to other virgin materials.

Human Capital and Employees

Overview

 Never before in Berry s long history has our mission of Always Advancing to Protect What s Important been more critical as we are proud to work alongside our customers to supply products that are truly ess ential to everyday life. The safety and supply of necessities such as food, medicines, sanitizing products, and protective healthcare apparel has never been more vital. We continue to prioritize the health and well-being of the communities we serve as well as our employees and their families, as our global teams remain dedicated to continuingly working seamlessly with our business partners to ensure critical key supply chains remain uninterrupted and operational.

Health and Safety

 Employee safe ty is our number one core value at Berry. We believe when it comes to employee safety, our best should always be our standard. It is through the adherence to our global Environment, Health, and Safety principles we have been able to identify and eliminate operational risks and drive continuous improvement, resulting in an OSHA incident rate below 1.0 which is significantly lower than the industry average. 

4 

Specifically related to Berry s internal COVID-19 protocols, our rigorous precautionary measures have included the formation of global and regional response teams that maintain contact with authorities and experts, quarantine protocols, disinfection measures and other actions designed to help protect employees. Additionally, while many do not realize the crucial role our products play in infection prevention and protecting from the spread of disease and contamination, we are proud to be a part of the fight and are privileged to support the growing need for many of our products as communities across the globe continue to struggle through the COVID-19 pandemic.

Talent and Development

 We seek to attract, develop and retain the best talent throughout the company. During the past decade, we established and expanded our recruiting and talent functions. Our succession management strategy focuses on structured succession framework based on Learning Agility and multiple years of performance. Our holistic approach to developing key managers and identifying future leaders includes challenging assignments, formal development plans and professional coaching. Resources to support employees in their personal and professional development include:

Leadership Foundations;

Operations Development Programs;

Core Advanced Selling Programs;

Partnering for the Planet;

University Partnerships;

Internal e-learning and development platforms;

Annual compliance, antitrust, bribery, corruption, business code of conduct and ethics training for key management level; and

Various other tuition reimbursement programs, apprenticeship and instructional programs.

Employee Engagement

 We seek to ensure that everyone is motivated to perform their best work every day. To further that objective, our engagement approach focuses on clear communication and recognition. We communicate through regular employee meetings, at both the corporate and operating division levels, with business and market updates and information on production, safety, quality and other operating metrics. We have many recognition-oriented awards throughout our company, including our corporate and divisional awards of excellence. We conduct company-wide engagement surveys which have generally indicated high levels of engagement and trust in Berry s leadership, key strategies and initiatives. Resources to support employee communication and engagement include:

Leadership sharing global perspectives, innovation, and company direction;

Peer groups sharing and supporting of common interests and partnership among emerging leaders;

Town halls fostering the OneBerry culture; and

Various other internal business updates, communications, bulletins, digital signage and newsletters.

Inclusion and Diversity

 As the world s leading global packaging company, we strive to build a safe and inclusive culture where every employee feels valued and treated with respect. We believe inclusion helps drive engagement, innovation and organizational growth. Our focus to date has been on providing training for our global workforce, expanding our employee resource groups, and increasing awareness about the importance of having a culture of inclusion. Resource groups to support employee acceptance and inclusion including US Veterans, employees with disabilities, women led alliances, employees of African descent, and sexual orientation.

Ethics

 Good corporate governance and transparency are fundamental to achieving our vision of becoming the premier packaging solutions provider in all our markets. Our employees are expected to act with integrity and objectivity and to always strive to enhance our reputation and performance. We maintain a Global Code of Business Ethics which is attested by every Berry employee and provides the Company's framework for ethical business. We provide targeted annual training across the globe to reinforce our commitment to ethics and drive adherence to the laws in each jurisdiction in which we operate.

Item 1A. RISK FACTORS

Operational Risks

Effectively managing change and growth.

Our future revenue and operating results will depend on our ability to effectively manage the anticipated growth and managing customer timelines. We are continuously investing in growth areas and expanding our operations, increasing our headcount and expanding into new product offerings. This growth has placed significant demands on our management as well as our financial and operational resources, and continued growth presents several challenges, including: 

expanding manufacturing capacity, maintaining quality and increasing production;

identifying, attracting and retaining qualified personnel; and

increasing our regulatory compliance capabilities, particularly in new lines of business or product offerings.

A failure to adequately manage these and other risks related to our growth could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Raw material inflation or shortage of available materials could harm our financial condition and results of operations.

Raw materials are subject to price fluct uations and availability, due to external factors, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, weather-related events, or other supply chain challenges, that are beyond our control. Temporary industry-wide shortages of raw materials have occurred in fiscal 2021, which has led to increased raw material price volatility and which could continue into fiscal 2022. Additionally, our suppliers could experience cost increases to produce raw material due to increases in carbon pricing. Historically we have been able to manage the impact of higher costs by increasing our selling prices. We have generally been well positioned to capture additional market share as our primarily raw material, polymer resin, is typically a lower cost and more versatile substrate compared to alternatives. However, raw material shortages or our inability to timely pass through increased costs to our customers may adversely affect our busin ess, financial condition and results of operations.

We may not be able to compete successfully and our customers may not continue to purchase our products.

We compete with multiple companies in each of our product lines on the basis of a number of considerations, including price, service, quality, product characteristics and the ability to supply products to customers in a timely manner. Our products also compete with various other substrates. Some of these competitive products are not subject to the impact of changes in resin prices, which may have a significant and negative impact on our competitive position versus substitute products. Additionally, consumer's view on environmental consideration could potentially impact demand for our products that utilize fossil fuel based materials in their manufacturing. Our competitors may have financial and other resources that are substantially greater than ours and may be better able than us to withstand higher costs. Competition and product preference changes could result in our products losing market share or our having to reduce our prices, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, since we do not have long-term arrangements with many of our customers, these competitive factors could cause our customers to shift suppliers and/or packaging material quickly. Our success depends, in part, on our ability to respond timely to customer and market changes.

We may pursue and execute acquisitions or divestitures, which could adversely affect our business.

As part of our growth strategy, we consider transactions that either complement or expand our existing business and create economic value. Transactions involve special risks, including the potential assumption of unanticipated liabilities and contingencies as well as difficulties in integrating acquired businesses or carving-out divested businesses, which may result in substantial costs, delays or other problems that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, we may not realize all of the synergies we expect to achieve from our current strategic initiatives due to a variety of risks. If we are unable to achieve the benefits that we expect to achieve from our strategic initiatives, it could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

In the event of a catastrophic loss of one of our key manufacturing facilities, our business would be adversely affected.

While we manufacture our products in a large number of diversified facilities and maintain insurance covering our facilities, including business interruption insurance, a catastrophic loss of the use of all or a portion of one of our key manufacturing facilities due to accident, labor issues, weather conditions, natural disaster, pandemic or otherwise, whether short or long-term, could result in significant losses.

6 

Employee retention, labor cost inflation or the failure to renew collective bargaining agreements could disrupt our business.

As of the end of fiscal 2021, we employed approximately 47,000 employees with approximately 20 of those employees being covered by collective bargaining agreements. The collective bargaining agreements covering a majority of these employees expire annually and as a result, are due for renegotiation in fiscal year ending 2022 fiscal 2022 ). Our relations with employees under collective bargaining agreements remain satisfactory and there have been no significant work stoppages or other labor disputes during the past three years. However, we may not be able to maintain constructive relationships with labor unions or trade councils and may not be able to successfully negotiate new collective bargaining agreements on satisfactory terms in the future.

Labor is subject to cost inflation and availability, due to external factors, such as the COVID-19 pandemic and workforce participation rates, that are beyond our control. As a result, there can be no assurance we will be able to recruit, train, assimilate, motivate and retain employees in the future. The loss of a substantial number of these employees or a prolonged labor dispute could disrupt our business and result in significant losses.

We depend on information technology systems and infrastructure to operate our business, and increased cybersecurity threats, system inadequacies, and failures could disrupt our operations, compromise customer, employee, vendor and other data which could negatively affect our business.

We rely on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of information technology systems and networks. These systems and networks are vulnerable to increased cybersecurity threats and more sophisticated computer crime, energy interruptions, telecommunications failures, breakdowns, natural disasters, terrorism, war, computer malware or other malicious intrusions.

We also maintain and have access to sensitive, confidential or personal data or information that is subject to privacy and security laws, regulations, and customer controls. Despite our efforts to protect such information, security breaches, misplaced or lost data and programming damages could result in production downtimes, operational disruptions, transaction errors, loss of business opportunities, violation of privacy laws and legal liability, fines, penalties or negative publicity could result in a negative impact on the business. While we have not had material system interruptions historically associated with these risks, there can be no assurance that these advanced and persistent threats will prevent future interruptions that could result in significant losses.

Financial and Legal Risks

Our substantial indebtedness could affect our ability to meet our obligations and may otherwise restrict our activities.

We have a significant amount of indebtedness, which requires significant interest payments. Our inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt obligations, or to refinance our obligations on commercially reasonable terms, would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, servicing the interest obligations of our existing indebtedness could limit our ability to respond to business opportunities, including growing our business through acquisitions or increased levels of capital expenditures.

Goodwill and other intangibles represent a significant amount of our net worth, and a future write-off could result in lower reported net income and a reduction of our net worth.

We have a substantial amount of goodwill. Future changes in market multiples, cost of capital, expected cash flows, or other external factors, may adversely affect our business and cause our goodwill to be impaired, resulting in a non-cash charge against results of operations to write off goodwill or indefinite lived intangible assets for the amount of impairment. If a future write-off is required, the charge could result in significant losses.

7 

Our international operations pose risks to our business that may not be present with our domestic operations.

Foreign operations are subject to certain risks that are unique to doing business in foreign countries. These risks include fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, inflation, economic or political instability, shipping delays in our products and receiving delays of raw materials, changes in applicable laws, including assessments of income and non-income related taxes, reduced protection of intellectual property, inability to readily repatriate cash to the U.S. effectively, and regulatory policies and various trade restrictions including potential changes to export taxes or countervailing and anti-dumping duties for exported products from these countries. Any of these risks could disrupt our business and result in significant losses. We are also subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws that generally bar bribes or unreasonable gifts to foreign governments or officials. We have implemented safeguards, training and policies to discourage these practices by our employees and agents. However, our existing safeguards, training and policies to assure compliance and any future improvements may prove to be less than effective and our employees or agents may engage in conduct for which we might be held responsible. If employees violate our policies, we may be subject to regulatory sanctions. Violations of these laws or regulations could result in sanctions including fines, debarment from export privileges and penalties and could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Current and future environmental and other governmental requirements could adversely affect our financial condition and our ability to conduct our business.

While we have not been required historically to make significant capital expenditures in order to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations, we cannot predict our future capital expenditure requirements because of continually changing compliance standards and environmental technology. Furthermore, violations or contaminated sites that we do not know about (including contamination caused by prior owners and operators of such sites or newly discovered information) could result in additional compliance or remediation costs or other liabilities, which could be material. In addition, federal, state, local, and foreign governments could enact laws or regulations concerning environmental matters, such as greenhouse gas emissions, that increase the cost of producing, or otherwise adversely affect the demand for, packaging products. Legislation that would prohibit, tax or restrict the sale or use of certain types of products would require diversion of solid waste such as packaging materials from disposal in landfills, has been or may be introduced. For example, the European Union ("EU") recently introduced a non-recycled polymer resin packaging waste bloc-wide levy. While each member state is evaluating how to fund the levy which ranges from taxing the sector or passing costs down the line to all businesses and end consumers, we believe that any such laws promulgated to date have not had a material adverse effect on us, as we have historically been able to manage the impact of higher costs by increasing our selling prices. However, there can be no assurance that future legislation or regulation would not have a material adverse effect on us.

Changes in tax laws or changes in our geographic mix of earnings could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operation.

We are subject to income and other taxes in the many jurisdictions in which we operate. Tax laws and regulations are complex and the determination of our global provision for income taxes and current and deferred tax assets and liabilities requires judgment and estimation. We are subject to routine examinations of our income tax returns, and tax authorities may disagree with our tax positions and assess additional tax. Our future income taxes could also be negatively impacted by our mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate being different than anticipated given differences in statutory tax rates in the countries in which we operate. In addition, tax policy efforts to raise global corporate tax rates could adversely impact our tax rate and subsequent tax expense.

We may not be successful in protecting our intellectual property rights, including our unpatented proprietary know-how and trade secrets, or in avoiding claims that we infringed on the intellectual property rights of others.

In addition to relying on patent and trademark rights, we rely on unpatented proprietary know-how and trade secrets, and employ various methods, including confidentiality agreements with employees and consultants, customers and suppliers to protect our know-how and trade secrets. However, these methods and our patents and trademarks may not afford complete protection and there can be no assurance that others will not independently develop the know-how and trade secrets or develop better production methods than us. Further, we may not be able to deter current and former employees, contractors and other parties from breaching agreements and misappropriating proprietary information and it is possible that third parties may copy or otherwise obtain and use our information and proprietary technology without authorization or otherwise infringe on our intellectual property rights. Furthermore, no assurance can be given that we will not be subject to claims asserting the infringement of the intellectual property rights of third parties seeking damages, the payment of royalties or licensing fees and/or injunctions against the sale of our products. Any such litigation could be protracted and costly and could result in significant losses.

Item 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANT S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS, AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES 

Our common stock BERY is listed on the New York Stock Exchange. As of the date of this filing there were fewer than 500 active record holders of the common stock, but we estimate the number of beneficial stockholders to be much higher as a number of our shares are held by brokers or dealers for their customers in street name. During fiscal 2020 and 2021, we did not declare or pay any cash dividends on our common stock.

Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, the Company did not repurchase shares. As of October 2, 2021, 393 million of authorized shares remained available for purchase under the current repurchase program which has no expiration date and may be suspended at any time.

Item 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Outlook

The Company is affected by general economic and industrial growth, raw material availability, cost inflation, supply chain disruptions, and general industrial production. The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in both advantaged and disadvantaged products within all segments. During fiscal 2022, we anticipate a headwind as the advantaged products, particularly in our Health, Hygiene Specialties segment, related to the COVID-19 pandemic moderate while recovery of disadvantaged products lags with the ultimate impact being affected by both the duration certain products remain advantaged and timing of when disadvantaged products normalize. Our business has both geographic and end market diversity, which reduces the effect of any one of these factors on our overall performance. Our results are affected by our ability to pass through raw material and other cost changes to our customers, improve manufacturing productivity and adapt to volume changes of our customers. By providing advantaged products in targeted markets, we continue to believe our underlying long-term demand fundamental in all divisions will remain strong as we focus on delivering protective solutions that enhance consumer safety and execute on the Company s mission statement of Always Advancing to Protect What s Important. For fiscal 2022, we project cash flow from operations between 1.8 to 1.7 billion, which includes the benefit from the lag in recovery of fiscal 2021 inflation, and free cash flow between 1 billion to 900 million. Projected fiscal 2022 free cash flow assumes 800 million of capital spending. For the definition of free cash flow and further information related to free cash flow as a non-GAAP financial measure, see Liquidity and Capital Resources. 

Recent Dispositions

During fiscal 2021, the Company completed the sale of its U.S. Flexible Packaging Converting business which was primarily operated in the Engineered Materials segment for net proceeds of 140 million and its non-core Czech Republic Reaction Injection Molding business which was operated in the Consumer Packaging International segment for net proceeds of 22 million. A net pretax loss on the divestitures of 22 million was recorded in fiscal 2021 within Restructuring and transaction activities on the Consolidated Statements of Income. The U.S Flexible Packaging Converting business and the Czech Republic Reaction Injection Molding business recorded net sales during fiscal 2020 of 203 million and 41 million, respectively.

Discussion of Results of Operations for Fiscal 2021 Compared to Fiscal 2020

The Company's U.S. based results for fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020 are based on a fifty-three and fifty-two week period, respectively. Business integration expenses consist of restructuring and impairment charges, acquisition and divestiture related costs, and other business optimization costs. Tables present dollars in millions. A discussion and analysis regarding our results of operations for fiscal year 2020 compared to fiscal year 2019 can be found on Form 8-K, Exhibit 99.1 filed with the SEC on September 2, 2021.

Net sales: The net sales growth is primarily attributed to increased selling prices of 1,429 million due to the pass through of inflation, organic volume growth of 4 , a 331 million favorable impact from foreign currency changes, and a 131 million increase from extra shipping days in fiscal 2021. These increases were partially offset by fiscal 2020 divestiture sales of 190 million. The organic volume growth was primarily due to organic growth investments, continued recovery of certain markets that had previously been facing COVID-19 headwinds, and higher demand in our advantaged health and hygiene products as the result of COVID-19.

Cost of goods sold: The cost of goods sold increase is primarily attributed to organic volume growth, product mix, inflation, an increase from foreign currency changes, and extra shipping days in fiscal 2021. These increases were partially offset by fiscal 2020 divestiture cost of goods sold of 157 million.

Operating Income: The operating income increase is primarily attributed to a 100 million increase from the organic volume growth, a 55 million favorable impact from foreign currency changes, a 37 million decrease in business integration, and a 22 million benefit from extra shipping days in fiscal 2021. These improvements are partially offset by a 75 million impact from inflation and product mix, a 19 million increase in depreciation and amortization, and fiscal 2020 divestiture operating income of 18 million.

The increase in comprehensive income is primarily attributed to a 174 million increase in net income, a 123 million favorable change in currency translation, a 188 million favorable change in the fair value of interest rate hedges and a 109 million favorable change from unrealized gains on the Company s pension plans. Currency translation gains are primarily related to non-U.S. subsidiaries with a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar whereby assets and liabilities are translated from the respective functional currency into U.S. dollars using period-end exchange rates. The change in currency translation was primarily attributed to locations utilizing the euro, British pound sterling, Brazilian real and Chinese renminbi as their functional currency. As part of the overall risk management, the Company uses derivative instruments to reduce exposure to changes in interest rates attributed to the Company s floating-rate borrowings and records changes to the fair value of these instruments in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). The change in fair value of these instruments in fiscal 2021 versus fiscal 2020 is primarily attributed to a change in the forward interest curve between measurement dates.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Senior Secured Credit Facility

We manage our global cash requirements considering (i) available funds among the many subsidiaries through which we conduct our business, (ii) the geographic location of our liquidity needs, and (iii) the cost to access international cash balances. We have an 850 million asset-based revolving line of credit that matures in May 2024. At the end of fiscal 2021, the Company had no outstanding balance on the revolving credit facility. The Company was in compliance with all covenants at the end of fiscal 2021. Refer to Note 3. Long-Term Debt for further information.

Cash Flows from Operating Activities

Net cash provided by operating activities increased 50 million from fiscal 2020 primarily attributed to improved net income prior to non-cash activities, partially offset by working capital inflation.

Cash Flows from Investing Activities

Net cash used in investing activities increased 195 million from fiscal 2020 primarily attributed to increased capital expenditures and proceeds from the settlement of cross-currency derivatives in fiscal 2020, partially offset for the divestiture of business in fiscal 2021.

Cash Flows from Financing Activities

Net cash used in financing activities decreased 479 million from fiscal 2020 primarily attributed to lower net repayments on long-term borrowings.

Share Repurchases

The Company did not have any share repurchases in fiscal 2021 or 2020.

Free Cash Flow

We define "free cash flow" as cash flow from operating activities less net additions to property, plant and equipment. Based on our definition, our consolidated free cash flow is summarized as follows:

We use free cash flow as a supplemental measure of liquidity as it assists us in assessing our ability to fund growth through generation of cash. Free cash flow may be calculated differently by other companies, including other companies in our industry or peer group, limiting its usefulness. Free cash flow is not a generally accepted accounting principles GAAP financial measure and should not be considered as an alternative to any other measure determined in accordance with GAAP.

Liquidity Outlook

At the end of fiscal 2021, our cash balance was 1,091 million, which was primarily located outside the U.S. We believe our existing and future U.S. based cash and cash flow from U.S. operations, together with available borrowings under our senior secured credit facilities, will be adequate to meet our short-term and long-term liquidity needs with the exception of funds needed to cover all long-term debt obligations which we intend to refinance prior to maturity. The Company has the ability to repatriate the cash located outside the U.S. to the extent not needed to meet operational and capital needs without significant restrictions. Our unremitted foreign earnings were 1.1 billion at the end of fiscal 2021. The computation of the deferred tax liability associated with unremitted earnings is not practicable.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

We disclose those accounting policies that we consider to be significant in determining the amounts to be utilized for communicating our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows in the first note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein. Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with these principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.

Pensions . The accounting for our pension plans requires us to recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of the pension plans on our balance sheet. For these sponsored plans, the relevant accounting guidance requires that management make certain assumptions relating to the long-term rate of return on plan assets, discount rates used to determine the present value of future obligations and expenses, salary inflation rates, mortality rates and other assumptions. We believe that the accounting estimates related to our pension plans are critical accounting estimates because they are highly susceptible to change from period to period based on the performance of plan assets, actuarial valuations, market conditions and contracted benefit changes. The selection of assumptions is based on historical trends and known economic and market conditions at the time of valuation, as well as independent studies of trends performed by our actuaries. 

We review annually the discount rate used to calculate the present value of pension plan liabilities. The discount rate used at each measurement date is set based on a high-quality corporate bond yield curve, derived based on bond universe information sourced from reputable third-party indices, data providers, and rating agencies. In countries where there is no deep market in corporate bonds, we have used a government bond approach to set the discount rate. Additionally, the expected long term rate of return on plan assets is derived for each benefit plan by considering the expected future long-term return assumption for each individual asset class. A single long-term return assumption is then derived for each plan based upon the plan s target asset allocation. Refer to Note 7. Retirement Plans for further information.

Deferred Taxes and Effective Tax Rates . We estimate the effective tax rate ETR and associated liabilities or assets for each of our legal entities in accordance with authoritative guidance. We utilize tax planning to minimize or defer tax liabilities to future periods. In recording ETRs and related liabilities and assets, we rely upon estimates, which are based upon our interpretation of U.S. and local tax laws as they apply to our legal entities and our overall tax structure. Audits by local tax jurisdictions, including the U.S. Government, could yield different interpretations from our own and cause the Company to owe more taxes than originally recorded. As part of the ETR, if we determine that a deferred tax asset arising from temporary differences is not likely to be utilized, we will establish a valuation allowance against that asset to record it at its expected realizable value. In multiple foreign jurisdictions, the Company believes that it will not generate sufficient future taxable income to realize the related tax benefits. The Company has provided a full valuation allowance against its foreign net operating losses included within the deferred tax assets in multiple foreign jurisdictions. The Company has not provided a valuation allowance on its federal net operating losses in the U.S. because it has determined that future reversals of its temporary taxable differences will occur in the same periods and are of the same nature as the temporary differences giving rise to the deferred tax assets. Refer to Note 6. Income Taxes for further information.

15 

Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 

Interest Rate Risk

We are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates primarily through our senior secured credit facilities. As of October 2, 2021, our senior secured credit facilities are comprised of (i) 3.4 billion term loans and (ii) an 850 million revolving credit facility with no borrowings outstanding. Borrowings under our senior secured credit facilities bear interest at a rate equal to an applicable margin plus LIBOR. The applicable margin for LIBOR rate borrowings under the revolving credit facility ranges from 1.25 to 1.50 , and the margin for the term loans is 1.75 per annum. As of October 2, 2021, the LIBOR rate of approximately 0.08 was applicable to the term loans. A 0.25 change in LIBOR would increase our annual interest expense by 3 million on variable rate term loans.

We seek to minimize interest rate volatility risk through regular operating and financing activities and, when deemed appropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments. These financial instruments are not used for trading or other speculative purposes. As of October 2, 2021, the Company effectively had (i) a 450 million interest rate swap transaction that swaps a one-month variable LIBOR contract for a fixed annual rate of 1.398 , with an expiration in June 2026, (ii) a 400 million interest rate swap transaction that swaps a one-month variable LIBOR contract for a fixed annual rate of 1.916 with an expiration in June 2026, (iii) an 884 million interest rate swap transaction that swaps a one month variable LIBOR contract for a fixed annual rate of 1.857 , with an expiration in June 2024, and (iv) a 473 million interest rate swap transaction that swaps a one month variable LIBOR contract for a fixed annual rate of 2.050 , with an expiration in June 2024.

Foreign Currency Risk

As a global company, we face foreign currency risk exposure from fluctuating currency exchange rates, primarily the U.S. dollar against the euro, British pound sterling, Brazilian real, Chinese renminbi, Canadian dollar and Mexican peso. Significant fluctuations in currency rates can have a substantial impact, either positive or negative, on our revenue, cost of sales, and operating expenses. Currency translation gains and losses are primarily related to non-U.S. subsidiaries with a functional currency other than U.S. dollars whereby assets and liabilities are translated from the respective functional currency into U.S. dollars using period-end exchange rates and impact our Comprehensive income. A 10 decline in foreign currency exchange rates would have had a 44 million unfavorable impact on fiscal 2021 Net income.

The Company is party to certain cross-currency swaps to hedge a portion of our foreign currency risk. The swap agreements mature May 2022 250 million) and June 2024 1,625 million) and July 2027 700 million). In addition to the cross-currency swaps, we hedge a portion of our foreign currency risk by designating foreign currency denominated long-term debt as net investment hedges of certain foreign operations. As of October 2, 2021, we had outstanding long-term debt of 785 million that was designated as a hedge of our net investment in certain euro-denominated foreign subsidiaries.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Berry Global Group, Inc.

Opinion on the Financial Statements

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Berry Global Group, Inc. (the Company) as of October 2, 2021 and September 26, 2020, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in stockholders equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended October 2, 2021, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements ). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at October 2, 2021 and September 26, 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended October 2, 2021, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of October 2, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated November 18, 2021 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Basis for Opinion

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Critical Audit Matters

The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.

United Kingdom Defined Benefit Pension Obligation

Description of the Matter

At October 2, 2021 the aggregate United Kingdom (UK) defined benefit pension obligation was 888 million and exceeded the fair value of pension plan assets of 828 million, resulting in an underfunded defined benefit pension obligation of 60 million. As disclosed in Notes 1 and 8 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company recognizes the overfunded or underfunded status of its pension plans in the consolidated balance sheet. The obligations for these plans are actuarially determined and affected by assumptions, including discount rates and mortality rates.
 
 Auditing the UK defined benefit pension obligation is complex and required the involvement of our actuarial specialists due to the highly judgmental nature of actuarial assumptions (e.g., discount rates and mortality rates) used in the measurement process. These assumptions have a significant effect on the projected benefit obligation.

How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit

We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls that address the measurement and valuation of the UK defined benefit pension obligation. This included management s review of the UK defined benefit pension obligation calculations and the significant actuarial assumptions used by management.
 
 To test the UK defined benefit pension obligation, we performed audit procedures that included, among others, evaluating the methodology used and the significant actuarial assumptions described above and testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data, including the participant data used by management . We involved our actuarial specialists to assist with our audit procedures. We compared the actuarial assumptions used by management to historical trends and evaluated the change in the defined benefit pension obligation from prior year due to the change in service cost, interest cost, actuarial gains and losses, benefit payments, contributions and other activities. In addition, we evaluated management s methodology for determining the discount rate that reflects the maturity and duration of the benefit payments and is used to measure the defined benefit pension obligation. As part of this assessment, we compared management s selected discount rate to an independently developed range of reasonable discount rates. To evaluate the mortality rate assumption, we assessed whether the information is consistent with publicly available information, and whether any market data adjusted for entity-specific factors were applied.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Berry Global Group, Inc.

Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

We have audited Berry Global Group, Inc. s internal control over financial reporting as of October 2, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Berry Global Group, Inc. (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of October 2, 2021, based on the COSO criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of October 2, 2021 and September 26, 2020, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in stockholders equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended October 2, 2021, and the related notes and our report dated November 18, 2021 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Basis for Opinion

The Company s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.

Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
