In this registration statement, forward-looking statements are generally identified by the words such as anticipate , plan , believe , expect , estimate , and the like. Forward-looking statements involve future risks and uncertainties, there are factors that could cause actual results or plans to differ materially from those expressed or implied. These statements are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and other factors that could cause the actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by the statements. The forward-looking information is based on various factors and is derived using numerous assumptions. A reader, whether investing in the Company s securities or not, should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which apply only as of the date of this annual report. Important factors that may cause actual results to differ from projections include, for example: the success or failure of management s efforts to implement the Registrant s plan of operation; the ability of the Registrant to fund its operating expenses; the ability of the Registrant to compete with other companies that have a similar plan of operation; the effect of changing economic conditions impacting our plan of operation; the ability of the Registrant to meet the other risks as may be described in future filings with the SEC. Organizational History and General Background of the Registrant The Company was incorporated in Florida in 1995 for the purpose of designing and manufacturing heat pump pool heaters, residential air conditioners and parallel flow coils for the heating, ventilation and air conditioning industry. In June 2002, the Registrant and its subsidiaries filed a petition for bankruptcy in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Florida. The Company emerged from bankruptcy in March 2004 free and clear of all liens, claims and obligations. On July 17, 2017, Peregrine Industries, Inc., (the Registrant issued a total of 22,477,843 or 97.7 of the issued common restricted shares of the Registrant s common stock, par value 0.0001 (the Shares to Dolomite Holdings Ltd., organized under the laws of the State of Israel and the corporate parent and principal shareholder of the Registrant Dolomite ). The Shares were issued upon the conversion by Dolomite, effective July 14, 2017, of principal and accrued interest owed by the Registrant to Dolomite evidenced by convertible notes and other short-term debt in the aggregate amount of 443,718, representing all of the liabilities of the Registrant at its fiscal year-ended June 30, 2017. The fair value of the shares was deemed to be the carrying value of the principal and accrued interest, 443,718. Dolomite was a related party therefore the settlement had no gain or loss. The issuance of the Shares was made in reliance upon the exemptions provided in Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Act and Regulation S promulgated by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Act ). . Effective July 21, 2017, Dolomite sold, transferred and assigned the total of 22,477,843 restricted shares of the Registrant s common stock, to four persons, none of whom were affiliated with the Registrant or with Dolomite. The 22,477,843 Shares represented in excess of 97 of the Registrant s total issued and outstanding Shares at July 21, 2017, resulting in a change of control of the Company. 3 Table of Contents On September 3, 2021, through our wholly owned subsidiary Mace Merger, Corp., Mace, Corporation was merged into our Company, through the issuance to each shareholders of one share of Peregrine, Industries for each four share of Mace, Corporation which they held. A total of 250,000,000 were issued. The 22,477,843 shares held per the above paragraph were returned to the Company for cancelation. Recent Developments On June 12, 2017, the Board of Directors of the Registrant appointed Mr. Zohar Shpitz as Chief Financial Officer (CFO) of the Registrant. Mr. Shpitz was appointed as CFO in connection with the resignation of Mr. Ofer Naveh as the Registrant s CFO, effective June 19, 2017. On July 21, 2017 all of the aforementioned resigned as directors, and officers, where appropriate, after appointing the following directors and officers: Miaohong Hanson, director and chief executive officer; John C. Hanson, director and vice president, finance (now resigned from all officer and director positions); Donghai Shi, director and executive vice president; Ronaldo Panida, director; Lili Fan, Secretary; and Ting Wang executive assistant. John Hanson, subsequently, resigned effective May 1, 2019 from all positions. Business Objectives of the Registrant The Registrant has no present operations, but, the new management has a business plan which it intends to pursue during the coming fiscal year. The Company has selected a target business on which to concentrate and plans to implement a business combination, unless Management determines that such transaction is not in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders. Accordingly, there is no basis for investors in the Company s common stock to evaluate the possible merits or risks of the target business or the particular industry in which it operates. To the extent we effect a business combination with a company or an entity in its early stage of development or growth, including entities without established records of sales or earnings, we may be affected by numerous risks inherent in the business and operations of an early stage or potential emerging growth company. Employees Because the Company, presently, has had no operations we currently have no employees, except for those included in the Mace, Corporation merger. The officers perform any duties necessary for corporate maintenance. Our CEO performs all duties related to the operations of this business. We also plan to utilize additional independent contractors on a part-time/as needed basis. 4 Table of Contents ITEM 1A.

ITEM 2. DESCRIPTION OF PROPERTIES The Registrant s corporate office is located at 9171 W Flamingo Rd. Las Vegas, NV. The office facilities consist of approximately 3,000 square feet of executive office space and are shared with the related party acquisition target. The Registrant believes that the office facilities are sufficient for the foreseeable future and this arrangement will remain until we consummate the business combination.

Opinion on the Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Peregrine Industries, Inc. as of July 31, 2021 and 2020, the related statements of operations, stockholders' equity (deficit), and cash flows for the years then ended, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the "financial statements"). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of July 31, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Substantial Doubt about the Company s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 3 to the financial statements, the Company has suffered recurring losses from operations and has a significant accumulated deficit. In addition, the Company continues to experience negative cash flows from operations. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. Management's plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 3. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) ("PCAOB") and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. Our audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. /s/ BF Borgers CPA PC BF Borgers CPA PC We have served as the Company's auditor since 2020 Lakewood, CO November 17, 2021 9 Table of Contents Peregrine Industries, Inc.

Notes to Financial Statements For the Year Ended July 31, 2021 NOTE 1 ORGANIZATION AND OPERATIONS: Peregrine Industries, Inc. (the Company was formed on October 1, 1995 for the purpose of manufacturing residential pool heaters. The Company was formerly located in Deerfield Beach, Florida. Products were primarily sold throughout the United States, Canada, and Brazil. In June 2002, the Registrant and its subsidiaries filed a petition for bankruptcy in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Florida. At present, the Company has no business operations and is deemed to be a shell company. The Company had a change in control on July 8, 2013 as a result of the sale by our former principal shareholders, Richard Rubin, Thomas J. Craft, Jr. and Ivo Heiden, of their 324,000 shares of common stock, representing approximately 61.8 of the Company s outstanding common stock, to Dolomite Industries Ltd Dolomite ). In connection with the private sale of their shares of common stock to Dolomite on July 2, 2013, Messrs. Rubin and Heiden agreed to waive a total of 224,196 in liabilities owed to them at June 30, 2013. In connection with the change of control transaction, two former principal shareholders transferred and assigned all 195,000 of their two convertible notes to three unaffiliated third parties and one affiliated party. See also note 3. On June 12, 2017, the Board of Directors of the Registrant appointed Mr. Zohar Shpitz as Chief Financial Officer (CFO) of the Registrant. Mr. Shpitz was appointed as CFO in connection with the resignation of Mr. Ofer Naveh as the Registrant s CFO, effective June 19, 2017. On July 21, 2017, new management acquired, 22,477,843 or 97.7 of the issued common restricted shares. The new management is developing a business plan which they anticipate implementing within the current fiscal year. On September 3, 2021, through our wholly owned subsidiary Mace Merger, Corp., Mace, Corporation was merged into our Company, through the issuance to each shareholders of one share of Peregrine, Industries for each four share of Mace, Corporation which they held. A total of 250,000,000 were issued. The 22,477,843 shares held per the above paragraph were returned to the Company for cancelation. NOTE 2 BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES: Basis of Presentation The financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America US GAAP ). On December 1, 2017, the Board of Directors of Peregrine Industries (the Company approved a change in the fiscal year end from June 30, to July 31, effective beginning with fiscal year commencing on July 1, 2019. The Company expects to make the fiscal year change on a prospective basis and will not adjust operating results for previous periods. However, the change will impact the prior year comparability of each of the fiscal quarters and annual period in 2020 in future filings. The Company believes this change will provide benefits, including aligning its reporting periods to be consistent with an intended merger with an operating company. 14 Table of Contents Peregrine, Industries, Inc. Notes to Financial Statements For the Year Ended July 31, 2021 Use of Estimates: The preparation of financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statement and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from the estimates. Cash and cash equivalents The Company maintains its cash in United States dollars in United States bank accounts which balances, may exceed the federal insured limit of 250,000. Earnings (loss) per share : Basic loss per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net loss per common share is computed using the weighted average number of common and dilutive equivalent shares outstanding during the period. Dilutive common equivalent shares consist of options to purchase common stock (only if those options are exercisable and at prices below the average share price for the period) and shares issuable upon the conversion of issued and outstanding preferred stock. Due to the net losses reported, dilutive common equivalent shares were excluded from the computation of diluted loss per share, as inclusion would be anti-dilutive for the periods presented. There were no common equivalent shares required to be added to the basic weighted average shares outstanding to arrive at diluted weighted average shares outstanding as of July 31, 2021 and 2020. Revenue Recognition The Company adopted Accounting Standards Codification ASC 606. ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, establishes principles for reporting information about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from the entity s contracts to provide goods or services to customers. The core principle requires an entity to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that it expects to be entitled to receive in exchange for those goods or services recognized as performance obligations are satisfied. The Company has assessed the impact of the guidance by performing the following five steps analysis: Step 1: Identify the contract Step 2: Identify the performance obligations Step 3: Determine the transaction price Step 4: Allocate the transaction price Step 5: Recognize revenue The Company generates revenue from the sale of items used for the care of babies. Although the Company plans to sell, its products through distributors, the bulk of current revenue is derived through internet and social media venues. Revenue is recognized upon delivery of services and when the Company has the right to invoice the customer using the allowable practical expedient under ASC 606-10-55-18 since the right to invoice the customer corresponds with the performance obligations completed. Revenue is recognized when obligations under the terms of a contract with the Company s customers are satisfied. Satisfaction of contract terms occurs when shipping is performed, and the customers assume risk of loss. The amount of consideration the Company expects to receive consists of the sales price adjusted for any incentives if applicable. In applying judgment, the Company considered customer expectations of performance, materiality and the core principles of ASC Topic 606. The Company s performance obligations are generally transferred to the customer at a point in time. The Company s contracts with customers generally do not include any variable consideration. 15 Table of Contents Peregrine, Industries, Inc. Notes to Financial Statements For the Year Ended July 31, 2021 Recent Accounting Pronouncements The Company continually assesses any new accounting pronouncements to determine their applicability to the Company. Where it is determined that a new accounting pronouncement affects the Company s financial reporting, the Company undertakes a study to determine the consequence of the change to its financial statements and assures that there are proper controls in place to ascertain that the Company s financials properly reflect the change. The Company currently does not have any recent accounting pronouncements that they are studying and feel may be applicable. Revenue is derived from the sale of the baby items invented by the Company. Revenue through July 31, 2020 is minimal as the Company is in its infancy and has been focused on product development, manufacturing and the creation of a distributorship network. Revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, pricing is fixed and determinable, collection is reasonably assured and delivery or performance of service has occurred. Customer prepayments are reflected as deferred revenue as long as there is persuasive evidence that the purchased product will be shipped within a reasonable time. The Company recognizes revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned. Product sales are recognized upon delivery of the products. The Company must meet all of the following four criteria in order to recognize revenue: Persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists Delivery has occurred The sales price is fixed or determinable Collection is reasonably assured Payments received in advance of satisfaction of the relevant criteria for revenue recognition are recorded as advances from customers. Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts Accounts receivable are stated at the amount management expects to collect from outstanding balances. Accounts receivable as of July 31, 2021 and 2020 were 26,420 and 34,805 respectively. An allowance for doubtful accounts will be provided for those accounts receivable considered to be uncollectable based on historical experience and management s evaluation of outstanding accounts receivable at the end of the period. Management has reviewed the current accounts receivable and has concluded that no allowance was necessary as of July 31, 2021 nor 2020. Bad debts will be written off against the allowance when identified. 16 Table of Contents Peregrine, Industries, Inc. Notes to Financial Statements For the Year Ended July 31, 2021 Inventory As at July 31, 2021 and 2020 respectively the Company had 784,374 and 785,500 worth of inventory, stated at the lower of cost or market, valued on an average cost basis. The inventory is reviewed at least quarterly and adjusted for and discrepancies. Managements evaluation was that there was no impairment required on July 31, 2021 or on July 31, 2020. Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements The Company has implemented all new accounting pronouncements that are in effect and that may impact its financial statements and does not believe that there are any other new pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations. Related Party Transactions We consider all directors, officers and those who own more than 5 shares to be related parties and record any transactions between them and the Company to be related party transactions and disclose such transactions on notes to the financial statements. Prepaid Expenses and Product Deposits Prepaid expenses, totaling 11,232 and 12,239 at July 31, 2021 and 2020 respectively consist of cash paid in advance for services to be provided. The Company outsources all of the manufacturing processes and has paid deposits, to its manufacturers. At July 31, 2021 and 2020, there were no outstanding deposits. Service provider prepayments are amortized over the useful life of the service. Property and Equipment Property and equipment consists primarily of office furniture and equipment stated at original cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is calculated using the straight line method based on the estimated useful life of the underlying asset, generally three to five years. Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred. Production Molds The building of production molds is outsourced to specialists and is recorded at the total cost to acquire each. The molds are built to specifications that include the number of parts anticipated to be produced. The cost of the mold is depreciated on a straight line basis over 5 years. Cost of repairs and maintenance will be expensed as incurred. The value of each mold is reviewed quarterly and will be impaired, when necessary, based on managements valuation of the molds continuing viability. Depreciation of 103,299 and 102,270 was recorded for each of the years ended July 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. 17 Table of Contents Peregrine, Industries, Inc. Notes to Financial Statements For the Year Ended July 31, 2021 Patents Patent costs consist of the legal fees paid to prepare, file and process the patent applications. Patents will be amortized, utilizing the straight line method, over the useful life of the patent and will be reviewed quarterly to determine if impairment is required. Research and development are not included in the cost of patents, and, are expensed as incurred. Management determined that patent assets should be impaired by 66,888 for the year ended July 31, 2021. Land and Building On September 27, 2017 the Company purchased property consisting of land and building at a total cost of 502,474, allocating 440,167 to the building and 62,307 to land. The building has been built out to serve as the Company s office headquarters. The building is being depreciated on a straight line basis over 25 years. Income taxes The Company follows ASC Topic 740 for recording the provision for income taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are computed based upon the difference between the financial statement and income tax basis of assets and liabilities using the enacted marginal tax rate applicable when the related asset or liability is expected to be realized or settled. Deferred income tax expenses or benefits are based on the changes in the asset or liability each period. If available evidence suggests that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized, a valuation allowance is required to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. Future changes in such valuation allowance are included in the provision for deferred income taxes in the period of change. Deferred income taxes may arise from temporary differences resulting from income and expense items reported for financial accounting and tax purposes in different periods. Deferred taxes are classified as current or non-current, depending on the classification of assets and liabilities to which they relate. Deferred taxes arising from temporary differences that are not related to an asset or liability are classified as current or non-current depending on the periods in which the temporary differences are expected to reverse. The Company applies a more-likely-than-not recognition threshold for all tax uncertainties. ASC Topic 740 only allows the recognition of those tax benefits that have a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities. As of July 31, 2021, the Company reviewed its tax positions and determined there were no outstanding, or retroactive tax positions with less than a 50 likelihood of being sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities, therefore this standard has not had a material effect on the Company. The Company does not anticipate any significant changes to its total unrecognized tax benefits within the next 12 months. The Company classifies tax-related penalties and net interest as income tax expense. As of July 31, 2021, no income tax expense has been incurred. 18 Table of Contents Peregrine, Industries, Inc. Notes to Financial Statements For the Year Ended July 31, 2021 The cumulative tax effect at the expected rate of 21 of significant items comprising our net deferred tax amount is as follows: July 31 2021 2020 Operating loss 3,287,397 3,146,935 Deferred tax benefit 690,353 660,856 Valuation allowance (690,353 (660,856 Net deferred tax asset - - Share-Based Compensation The Company accounts for stock-based compensation to employees in accordance with FASB ASC 718 Compensation Stock Compensation. Stock-based compensation to employees is measured at the grant date, based on the fair value of the award, and is recognized as expense over the requisite employee service period. The Company accounts for stock-based compensation to other than employees in accordance with FASB ASC 505-50. Equity instruments issued to other than employees are valued at the earlier of a commitment date or upon completion of the services, based on the fair value of the equity instruments and is recognized as expense over the service period. Fair Value Measurement The Company adopted FASB 820 Fair Value Measurement and Disclosures, or ASC 820, for assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis. ASC 820 establishes a common definition for fair value to be applied to existing generally accepted accounting principles that require the use of fair value measurements establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure about such fair value measurements. The adoption of ASC 820 did not have an impact on the Company s financial position or operating results, but did expand certain disclosures. ASC 820 defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Additionally ASC 820 requires the use of valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. These inputs are prioritized below: Level 1: Observable inputs such as quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable, either directly or indirectly. These include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets and quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active. Level 3: Unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists, therefore developed using estimates and assumptions developed by us, which reflect those that a market participant would use. The Company did not have any Level 2 or Level 3 assets or liabilities as of July 31, 2021. 19 Table of Contents Peregrine, Industries, Inc. Notes to Financial Statements For the Year Ended July 31, 2021 Recent Accounting Pronouncements The Company has evaluated the recent accounting pronouncements through the date of this report and believes that none of them will have a material effect on the company s financial statements. NOTE 3 GOING CONCERN: The Company s financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and settlement of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business for the foreseeable future. The Company has accumulated losses aggregating 3,287,397 as of July 31, 2021 and 3,146,935 as of July 31, 2020 and has insufficient working capital to meet operating needs for the next twelve months, all of which raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustment relating to the recoverability and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. The Company is taking appropriate action to provide the necessary capital to continue its operations. These steps include, but are not limited to: 1) implementation of new business plan 2) focus on sales to minimize the need for capital at this stage; 3) raising equity financing; 4) continuous focus on reductions in cost where possible. NOTE 4 RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS: During the year ended July 31, 2020 Mace Corporation paid a total 14,097 directly to service providers compared to 15,935 for the year ended July 31, 2021.

Notes to Financial Statements For the Year Ended July 31, 2021 NOTE 6 PAYCHECK PROTECTION PROGRAM On March 27, 2020, the U.S. federal government enacted the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act CARES Act ), which includes provision for a Paycheck Protection Program PPP administered by the U.S. Small Business Administration SBA ). The PPP allows qualifying businesses to borrow up to 10 million calculated based on qualifying payroll costs. The loan is guaranteed by the federal government, and does not require collateral. On May 4, 2020, the Company accepted a Bank of America PPP Loan, in the amount of 76,061. The PPP Loan matures on April 30, 2022 and bears interest at a rate of 1.0 per annum, unless forgiven.

CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE None. ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Management s Report on Disclosure Controls and Procedures Disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act ), are our controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Act is accumulated and communicated to our management to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Rules 13a-15(b) and 15d-15(b) under the Exchange Act, requires us to carry out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of July 31, 2021. This evaluation was implemented under the supervision and with the participation of our officers and directors. Based on this evaluation, management concluded that, as of July 31, 2021 our disclosure controls and procedures are ineffective in ensuring that information required to be disclosed in our Exchange Act reports is (1) recorded, processed, summarized and reported in a timely manner and (2) accumulated and communicated to our management to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our officers and directors have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures had the following material weaknesses: We were unable to maintain any segregation of duties within our financial operations due to our reliance on limited personnel in the finance function. This control deficiency resulted in an audit adjustment to our financial statements, and could have resulted in a material misstatement that might have been prevented or detected by a segregation of duties. We do not have an independent Board of Directors, nor do we have a board member designated as an independent financial expert. The Board of Directors is comprised of four members who also serve as executive officers. As a result, there is a lack of independent oversight of the management team, lack of independent review of our operating and financial results, and lack of independent review of disclosures made by us; and documentation of all proper accounting procedures is not yet complete. There is a lack of formal documentation of internal control policies and procedures. To the extent reasonably possible given our limited resources, we intend to take measures to cure the aforementioned weaknesses, including, but not limited to, the following: Engaging consultants to assist in ensuring that accounting policies and procedures are consistent across the organization and that we have adequate control over financial statement disclosures; 22 Table of Contents Hiring additional qualified financial personnel; Expanding our current board of directors to include additional independent individuals willing to perform directorial functions; and Increasing our workforce in preparation for exiting the development stage and commencing revenue producing operations. Since the recited remedial actions will require that we hire or engage additional personnel, these material weaknesses may not be overcome in the near-term due to our limited financial resources. Until such remedial actions can be realized, we will continue to rely on the limited advice of outside professionals and consultants. These initiatives will be subject to our ability to obtain sufficient future financing and subject to our ability to start generating revenue. Management s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Our internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation and fair presentation of our financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Our officers have assessed the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting as of July 31, 2021. In making this assessment, management used the criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based upon its assessment, management concluded that, as of July 31, 2021, our internal control over financial reporting was ineffective. Management has identified a lack of sufficient personnel in the accounting function due to our limited resources with appropriate skills, training and experience to perform the review processes to ensure the complete and proper application of generally accepted accounting principles. We are in the process of developing and implementing remediation plans to address our material weaknesses in our internal controls. Management has identified specific remedial actions to address the material weaknesses described above: Improve the effectiveness of the accounting group by augmenting our existing resources with additional consultants or employees to improve segregation procedures and to assist in the analysis and recording of complex accounting transactions and preparation of tax disclosures. We plan to mitigate the segregation of duties issue by hiring additional personnel in the accounting department once we have achieved positive cash flow from operations and/or have raised significant additional working capital; and improve segregation procedures by strengthening cross approval of various functions including cash disbursements and quarterly internal audit procedures where appropriate. 23 Table of Contents Due to its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. This Annual Report does not include an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management s report was not subject to attestation by our registered public accounting firm pursuant to an exemption for smaller reporting companies under Section 989G of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting During the year ended July 31, 2021 there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
