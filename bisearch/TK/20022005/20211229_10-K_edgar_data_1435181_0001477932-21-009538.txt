(the Company was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on November 26, 2007. The Company is headquartered in Coquitlam, British Columbia. The Company s mission is to advance the technology of tissue culture science and to provide the highest quality 100 germ free, disease free and all genetically the same plantlets of high CBD hemp and other flora and offering full spectrum DNA testing for plant identification, live genetics preservation using low temperature storage for various cannabis and horticulture plants; extraction of botanical oils mainly CBD oil, and to deliver laboratory based services to the North American high CBD hemp, Cannabis and agriculture sectors. Management cannot provide assurance that the Company will ultimately achieve profitable operations or become cash flow positive, or raise additional debt and/or equity capital. However, if the Company is unable to raise additional capital in the near future, due to the Company s liquidity problems, management expects that the Company will need to curtail operations, liquidate assets, seek additional capital on less favourable terms and/or pursue other remedial measures. These consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. The Company has decided that immediate business development in the hemp and cannabis industries provides a much greater opportunity in the United States. The project at Deroche has been placed on hold while the Company moves forward to build out a similar infrastructure planned for Deroche within the United States. On July 25th 2021, the Company entered into a Memorandum of Understanding to acquire all the assets and cannabis business operation (includes 12 acres property, structure and cannabis licenses, existing sales channels and distribution networks) from a private company situated in Northern California. Upon reaching a definitive agreement, the Company intends to further develop a state-of-the-art flowering greenhouse of approximately 12,000 square feet or the maximum allowed by California State and Regional County. The acquisition price is 2.4 million to be paid through a combination of cash and shares. The Company also has an option from the seller to acquire an additional 120 acres or more of land for business expansion and development. The Company currently lacks funds with which to consummate the contemplated transaction and has not negotiated a definitive agreement with respect to the contemplated transaction. Thus, there is no assurance that the Company will ever enter into, and consummate, a definitive agreement with respect to the contemplated transaction. The recent outbreak of the novel coronavirus COVID-19, which was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization on March 11, 2020, has led to adverse impacts on the U.S. and global economies, disruptions of financial markets, and created uncertainty regarding potential impacts to the Company s supply chain, operations, and customer demand. The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted and could further impact the Company s operations and the operations of the Company s suppliers and vendors as a result of quarantines, facility closures, and travel and logistics restrictions. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts the Company s business, results of operations and financial condition will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including, but not limited to the duration, spread, severity, and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company s customers, suppliers, and vendors and the remedial actions and stimulus measures adopted by local and federal governments, and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume. The management team is closely following the progression of COVID-19 and its potential impact on the Company. Even after the COVID-19 pandemic has subsided, the Company may experience adverse impacts to its business as a result of any economic recession or depression that has occurred or may occur in the future. Therefore, the Company cannot reasonably estimate the impact at this time our business, liquidity, capital resources and financial results. Company History Overview Pharmagreen Biotech Inc. the Company was incorporated under the laws of Nevada, U.S. on November 26, 2007 under the name Azure International, Inc. On October 30, 2008 and effective as of the same date, the Company filed Articles of Merger with the Secretary of the State of Nevada, to effect a merger by and between Air Transport Group Holdings, Inc., a Nevada corporation incorporated on October 16, 2008, and Azure International, Inc. As a result of the merger, the Company changed its name to Air Transport Group Holdings, Inc. 3 Table of Contents On April 12, 2018, the Company entered into a share exchange agreement with WFS Pharmagreen Inc., a private company incorporated under the laws of British Columbia, Canada, whereby the Company acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of WFS Pharmagreen Inc. in exchange for 37,704,500 shares of common stock of the Company. Upon completion of this transaction, the shareholders of WFS Pharmagreen hold 95.5 of voting control of the Company. Immediately prior to closing of the Agreement, the majority shareholder of the Company was also the majority shareholder of WFS. As a result of the common ownership upon closing of the transaction, the acquisition was considered a common-control transaction and was outside the scope of the business combination guidance in ASC 805-50. The entities are deemed to be under common control as of February 27, 2018, which was the date that the majority shareholder acquired control of the Company and, therefore, held control over both companies. On May 2, 2018, the Share Exchange Agreement was effected. In connection with this transaction, the Company changed its name on May 8, 2018 to Pharmagreen Biotech Inc. and changed its year end from April 30th to September 30th. Our principal executive offices are temporarily located at 2987 Blackbear Court, Coquitlam, British Columbia, Canada. Our telephone number is (702-803-9404). Our internet address is www.pharmagreen.ca . On August 7, 2020, our company (including our subsidiaries) filed voluntary petitions under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Nevada, Case No. 20-13886. On October 9, 2020, a stay order was lifted by a United States District Judge of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, on an action filed by a lender. This effectively removed the Company from its Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings and protection. We expect to continue to incur losses for at least the next 12 months. We do not expect to generate revenue that is sufficient to cover our expenses, and we do not have sufficient cash and cash equivalents to execute our plan of operations for at least the next twelve months. We will need to obtain additional financing, through equity security sales, debt instruments and private financing, to conduct our day-to-day operations, and to fully execute our business plan. We plan to raise the capital necessary to fund our business through the sale of equity securities, debt instruments or private financing. These factors raise substantial doubt upon the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. This report does not reflect all the adjustments that may be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern. Item 1A. Risk Factors. As a smaller reporting company, as defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act, we are not required to provide the information called for by this Item. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments. None Item 2. Properties. We do not own any real estate or other properties and have not entered into any long-term lease or rental agreements for property. Item 3. Legal Proceedings. On July 22, 2020, the Company received a preliminary statement of claim from a convertible note holder for failure of the Company to deliver shares of common stock upon receipt of notices of conversion. Pursuant to the claim, the plaintiff has requested receipt of all shares of common stock requested in the notices of conversion, and also damages in an amount to be determined at trial but in any event in excess of principal amount of 78,000 for a total sum of 180,000, including without limitation the balance of any portion of the convertible note that ultimately is not converted into shares of common stock, along with default interest, liquidated damages, and damages as provided for in the convertible note. On October 9, 2020, a stay order was lifted by a United States District Judge of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, on an action filed by a lender. This effectively removed the Company from its Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings and protection. The lifting of the stay order further allowed the convertible note holders to convert thereby increasing the number of shares issued and outstanding. On October 29, 2020 a second note holder filed a statement of claim. This lender, as of December 24, 2020, has completely converted the full amount of the note of 100,000, interest of 8,689.80 and penalty and fees aggregating 19,500. 4 Table of Contents Also, as mentioned above, the Company filed voluntary petitions for reorganization under chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Nevada on August 7, 2020. The Company s filing with the Court was designated as Case No. 20-13886. During the pendency of this matter, the Company has also filed motions with the Court seeking authorization to continue to operate its businesses as debtors-in-possession under the jurisdiction of the Court and in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code and orders of the Court. Due to the stay order mentioned, the Company did not file a plan of reorganization with the Court for approval. On March 12, 2021, the Company entered into a settlement agreement with the convertible noteholder that had filed a preliminary statement of claim on July 22, 2020. Pursuant to the agreement the Company was required to honor various conversion notices and the noteholder agreed to wave all principal, interest and penalties incurred. On March 10, 2021, the promissory note holder referred to in Note 4 (a) of the accompanying consolidated financial statements filed a Notice of Motion For Summary Judgement in Lieu of Complaint (the Notice with the State of New York Supreme Court, County of New York for 40,504 plus interest at the rate of 10 per annum from January 6, 2021 plus costs. On July 31, 2021, the Notice was dismissed without prejudice by the State of New York Supreme Court. On October 20, 2021, the promissory note holder filed an Amended Notice of Motion for Summary Judgment in Lieu of Complaint with the State of New York Supreme Court, County of New York for 44,504.11 plus interest at the rate of 10 per annum from January 6, 2021, plus costs and attorney fees. The Company believes the claim is without merit, as evidenced by the initial claim being dismissed by the same courts, and will vigorously defend its position. Except as mentioned in the preceding paragraphs, there are no pending legal proceedings to which the Company is a party or in which any director, officer or affiliate of the Company, any owner of record or beneficially of more than 5 of any class of voting securities of the Company, or stockholder is a party adverse to the Company or has a material interest adverse to the Company. Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures. N/A 5 Table of Contents PART II Item 5. Market for Registrant s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities. Our Common Stock is currently quoted on the OTC Market under the symbol PHBI. Prior to July 31, 2018, our Common Stock was quoted under the symbol AITGD. Quotations of our Common Stock began on June 10, 2008. Our Common Stock was listed and commenced trading on the OTC Market on June 10, 2008. The Company s Regulation offering was qualified on September 24, 2021. Under the terms of the offering, the Company is offering for sale up to a maximum of 300,000,000 units at 0.025 per unit to raise up to US 7.5 million. The minimum investment is set at US 1,000.00. The primary use of proceeds is to be used for the acquisition of a California based Cannabis Licensed Company and to construct state of the art greenhouse on property owned by this Company. As of September 30, 2021, we had 381,171,269 shares of our Common Stock issued and outstanding held by approximately 209 stockholders of record. To date, we have not paid dividends on our Common Stock. Our Common Stock is very thinly traded and, thus, pricing of our Common Stock on OTC Markets does not necessarily represent its fair market value.

Selected Financial Data As a smaller reporting company, as defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act, we are not required to provide the information called for by this Item. Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Management s Discussion and Analysis This section of the Form 10-K includes a number of forward-looking statements that reflect our current views with respect to future events and financial performance. Forward-looking statements are often identified by words like believe, expect, estimate, anticipate, intend, project and similar expressions, or words which, by their nature, refer to future events. You should not place undue certainty on these forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our predictions. Capital Resources and Liquidity Our auditors have issued a going concern opinion, meaning that there is substantial doubt if we can continue as an on-going business unless we obtain additional capital. No substantial revenues from our planned business model are anticipated until we have completed financing the Company. As at September 30, 2021, the Company has a working capital deficit of 1,653,334 and an accumulated deficit of 11,699,417. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. We need to seek capital from resources such as the sale of private placements in the Company s common stock or debt financing, which may not even be available to the Company. However, if such financing were available, because we are an early stage company with no or limited operations to date, it would likely have to pay additional costs associated with such financing and in the case of high risk loans be subject to an above market interest rate. At such time these funds are required, management would evaluate the terms of such financing. If the Company cannot raise additional proceeds via such financing, it may be required to cease business operations. As of September 30, 2021, we had 25,300 in cash, amounts receivable of 290, and prepaid expenses and deposits of 347,491, as compared to 12,196 in cash, amounts receivable of 295 and prepaid expenses and deposits of 253,754 as of September 30, 2020. As of the date of this Form 10-K, the current funds available to the Company will not be sufficient to fund the expenses related to maintaining our planned operations. We are in the process of seeking additional equity financing in the form of private placements, loans and registration statements to fund our intended business operations. Management believes that if subsequent private placements are successful or we are successful in raising funds from registered securities, we will generate sales revenue within twelve months thereof. However, additional equity financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all, and thus we could fail to satisfy our future cash requirements. We do not anticipate researching any further products nor the purchase or sale of any significant equipment. We also do not expect any significant additions to the number of employees. 7 Table of Contents Results of Operations We had no revenue for the years ended September 30, 2021 and 2020. Total operating expenses for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021 was 744,064 compared to operating expenses for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020, of 485,756. In addition to operating expenses, we incurred other expenses of 3,788,160 during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021 compared to other expenses of 1,996,856 for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021, we incurred a net loss of 4,532,071 compared to a net loss of 2,437,870 for the year ended September 30, 2020. The increase in net loss for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021 compared to September 30, 2020 was mainly due to the following: An increase in consulting fees from 224,691 in 2020 to 526,522 in 2021 due to an increased use of consultants as part of our continued growth and development of our strategic objectives as a publicly-listed company; An increase in general and administrative fees from 63,711 in 2020 to 79,422 in 2021, which was primarily due to an increase in administrative fees based on higher overhead costs; An increase in interest and finance costs from 343,942 in 2020 to 680,714 in 2021, which was mainly attributable an increase in default penalties incurred on convertible notes due to the debentures maturing without repayment and due to the declaration of reorganization in August 2020 that triggered a default event on the outstanding debentures; and An increase in loss on change in fair value of derivative liabilities from 1,149,450 in 2020 to 3,257,122 in 2021, which related to the embedded conversion features on the Company s convertible debentures entered into during the year and due to the conversion of additional default penalties during the year at a heavily-discounted conversion price. The increase was partially offset by the following: An increase in the gain on settlement on convertible notes from a loss of 33,087 in 2020 to a gain of 237,940 in 2021; A decrease in accretion of discount of convertible notes from 328,333 in 2020 to 88,264 in 2021, which related to the decrease in convertible debt financing during the year; A decrease in impairment of property and equipment from 434,601 in 2020 to nil in 2021 as we wrote off our construction costs relating to the proposed biotech complex in Deroche in fiscal 2020 and did not incur any new capital expenditure costs; and, A decrease in the gain from write-off of accounts payable from 292,557 in 2020 to nil in 2021, as we recorded a one-time write-off of amounts owed for professional services in fiscal 2020. During the year ended September 30, 2021, and 2020, we incurred a net loss of 0.02 and 0.03 per share, respectively. Off-balance sheet arrangements The Company has no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect or change on the Company s financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors. The term off-balance sheet arrangement generally means any transaction, agreement or other contractual arrangement to which an entity unconsolidated with the Company is a party, under which the Company has (i) any obligation arising under a guarantee contract, derivative instrument or variable interest; or (ii) a retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to such entity or similar arrangement that serves as credit, liquidity or market risk support for such assets. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. As a smaller reporting company, as defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act, we are not required to provide the information called for by this Item. 8 Table of Contents Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data PHARMAGREEN BIOTECH INC. Consolidated Financial Statements Years Ended September 30, 2021, and 2020 (Expressed in U.S. Dollars) 9 Table of Contents REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Pharmagreen Biotech Inc. Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Pharmagreen Biotech Inc. (the Company as of September 30, 2021 and 2020, and the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss, stockholders deficit, and cash flows for the years then ended and related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements ). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as at September 30, 2021 and 2020, and the results of their operations and cash flows for the years then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Explanatory Paragraph Regarding Going Concern The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has incurred significant operating losses and negative cash flows from operations since inception. As at September 30, 2021, the Company has a working capital deficit of 1,653,334 and an accumulated deficit of 11,699,417. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. Management s plans in regard to these matters are also discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. Basis for Opinion These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal controls over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of the Company s internal controls over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal controls over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 10 Table of Contents Critical Audit Matters Critical audit matters are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (i) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements; and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgements. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter, in any way, our opinion on the consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures for which they relate. Accounting for Embedded Conversion Features (Derivative Liabilities) within Convertible Notes Payable Description of Critical Audit Matter As at September 30, 2021, the Company had 472,003 of derivative liabilities resulting from two convertible note agreements with third parties that have a floating rate of conversion into the Company s common shares based on a discount percentage of the lowest trading price of the Company s common stock on the prior twenty trading days prior to conversion. The determination of the fair value of the derivative liabilities requires the fair value of the conversion feature to be bifurcated from the original terms of the convertible note, and requires management judgement to determine the appropriate fair value of the embedded conversion feature using valuation techniques that utilizes management judgement in determining appropriate inputs to the valuation model. How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit Our audit procedures relating to the evaluation for the Company s assessment of the fair value of the derivative liabilities included: Independent confirmation of convertible note balances, including accrued interest and terms of the agreement as at September 30, 2021; Independent assessment of the appropriate valuation model for derivative liability, including performing independent calculations based on the same model utilized by the Company, and comparing the results of our assessment to the Company; Reviewing board resolutions and communications from convertible note holders to determine if any other default factors or additional penalties should be considered for recognition in the Company s consolidated financial statements; and Testing of substantially all transaction related to this matter, including the issuance of common shares relating to the conversion of convertible notes. /s/ SATURNA GROUP CHARTERED PROFESSIONAL ACCOUNTANTS LLP Saturna Group Chartered Professional Accountants LLP We have served as the Company s auditor since 2017 Vancouver, Canada December 29, 2021 11 Table of Contents PHARMAGREEN BIOTECH INC.

As a result of the voluntary petition, various convertible note holders triggered default provisions on the Company s outstanding convertible notes. On October 9, 2020, a stay order was lifted by a United States District Judge of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, on an action filed by a lender. This effectively removed the Company from its Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings and protection. Furthermore, the Company has defaulted on other convertible notes. These factors raise substantial doubt upon the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. These consolidated financial statements do not reflect any adjustments that may be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern. The outbreak of the novel coronavirus COVID-19, which was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization on March 11, 2020, has led to adverse impacts on the U.S. and global economies, disruptions of financial markets, and created uncertainty regarding potential impacts to the Company s supply chain, operations, and customer demand. The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted and could further impact the Company s operations and the operations of the Company s suppliers and vendors as a result of quarantines, facility closures, and travel and logistics restrictions. Specifically, the Company attributes the pandemic to a delay in a planned financing which was to be used for the construction of the biotech complex, resulting in an impairment of the capitalized construction-in-progress at September 30, 2020. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic further impacts the Company s business, results of operations and financial condition will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including, but not limited to the duration, spread, severity, and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company s customers, suppliers, and vendors and the remedial actions and stimulus measures adopted by local and federal governments, and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume. The management team is closely following the progression of COVID-19 and its impact on the Company. Even after the COVID-19 pandemic has subsided, the Company may continue to experience adverse impacts to its business as a result of any economic recession or depression that has occurred or may occur in the future. Therefore, the Company cannot reasonably estimate the impact at this time our business, liquidity, capital resources, and financial results. 16 Table of Contents PHARMAGREEN BIOTECH INC.

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Disclosure controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time period specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is accumulated and communicated to management including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In connection with this annual report, as required by Rule 13a -15d and 15d-15e under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, we have carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our company s disclosure controls and procedures. This evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of our company s management, including our company s principal executive officer and principal financial officer. Based upon that evaluation, our company s principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that as of September 30, 2021 our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective due to the existence of material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting. Management s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the Company s Principal Executive and Principal Financial officer and effected by the Company s board of directors, management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and includes those policies and procedures that: 1. Pertains to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect our transactions and disposition of assets; 2. Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and receipts and expenditures are being made in accordance with authorizations of management and directors; and 3. Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of company assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements. Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting established in SEC guidance on conducting such assessments as of the end of the period covered by this report. Management conducted the assessment based on certain criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in 2013. As of September 30, 2021, management determined material weaknesses occurred over our internal control over financial reporting as discussed below. The matters involving internal controls and procedures that the Company s management considered to be material weaknesses under the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board were: (1) lack of a functioning audit committee and lack of a majority of outside directors on the Company s board of directors, resulting in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures; (2) inadequate segregation of duties consistent with control objectives; (3) insufficient written policies and procedures for accounting and financial reporting with respect to the requirements and application of US GAAP and SEC disclosure requirements; and (4) ineffective controls over period end financial disclosure and reporting processes. Due to these material weaknesses management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of September 30, 2021. 34 Table of Contents Material Weakness Discussion and Remediation Management believes that the material weaknesses set forth in items (2), (3) and (4) above did not have an effect on the Company s previous reported financial results. However, management believes that the lack of a functioning audit committee and lack of a majority of outside directors on the Company s board of directors, resulting in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures can result in the Company s determination to its financial statements for the future periods. We are committed to improving our financial organization. As part of this commitment, we will create a position to segregate duties consistent with control objectives and will increase our personnel resources and technical accounting expertise within the accounting function when funds are available to the Company: i) Appointing one or more outside directors to our board of directors who shall be appointed to the audit committee of the Company resulting in a fully functioning audit committee who will undertake the oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures; and ii) Preparing and implementing sufficient written policies and checklists which will set forth procedures for accounting and financial reporting with respect to the requirements and application of US GAAP and SEC disclosure requirements. Management believes that the appointment of one or more outside directors, who shall be appointed to a fully functioning audit committee, will remedy the lack of a functioning audit committee and a lack of a majority of outside directors on the Company s Board. In addition, management believes that preparing and implementing sufficient written policies and checklists will remedy the following material weaknesses (i) insufficient written policies and procedures for accounting and financial reporting with respect to the requirements and application of US GAAP and SEC disclosure requirements; and (ii) ineffective controls over period end financial close and reporting processes. Further, management believes that the hiring of additional personnel who have the technical expertise and knowledge will result proper segregation of duties and provide more checks and balances within the department. Additional personnel will also provide the cross training needed to support the Company if personnel turn over issues within the department occur. This coupled with the appointment of additional outside directors will greatly decrease any control and procedure issues the company may encounter in the future. We will continue to monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of our internal controls and procedures and our internal controls over financial reporting on an ongoing basis and are committed to taking further action and implementing additional enhancements or improvements, as necessary and as funds allow. This annual report does not include an attestation report of the company s registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management s report was not subject to attestation by the company s registered public accounting firm pursuant to temporary rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission that permit the Company to provide only management s report in this annual report.

Outstanding Equity Awards at Fiscal Year-End No executive officer received any equity awards, or holds exercisable or un-exercisable options, as of the year ended September 30, 2021. Stock Awards Plan The company has not adopted a Stock Awards Plan, but may do so in the future. The terms of any such plan have not been determined. Compensation Committee The Company currently does not have a compensation committee of the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors as a whole determines executive compensation. There have never been any grants of stock options to our officers or directors. Our directors are appointed for a one-year term to hold office until the next annual general meeting of our shareholders or until their successors are elected or appointed. Our officers are appointed by our board of directors and serve at the discretion of the board. We believe Mr. Wojcik is qualified to act as director based upon his knowledge of business practices and, in particular, the regulations relating to public companies. Mr. Wojcik is not independent as that term is defined in Section 803 of the NYSE MKT Company Guide. We do not have a financial expert as that term is defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Our Board of Directors does not have standing audit, nominating, or compensation committees, committees performing similar functions, or charters for such committees. Instead, the functions that might be delegated to such committees are carried out by our Directors, to the extent required. Our Directors believe that the cost of associated with such committees, has not been justified under our current circumstances. Compensation of Directors During the years ended September 30, 2021, and 2020, we did not compensate any person for serving as a director. There have never been any grants of stock options to our officers or directors.

Peter Wojcik does not qualify as an independent director in accordance with the published listing requirements of the NASDAQ Global Market. The NASDAQ independence definition includes a series of objective tests, such as that the director is not, and has not been for at least three years, one of the Company s employees and that neither the director, nor any of his family members has engaged in various types of business dealings with us. In addition, the board of directors has not made a subjective determination as to each director that no relationships exist which, in the opinion of the board of directors, would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director, though such subjective determination is required by the NASDAQ rules. Had the board of directors made these determinations, the board of directors would have reviewed and discussed information provided by the directors and the Company with regard to each director s business and personal activities and relationships as they may relate to the Company and its management.
