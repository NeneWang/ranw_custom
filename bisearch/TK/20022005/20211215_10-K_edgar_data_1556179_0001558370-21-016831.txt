 ROCKY MOUNTAIN INDUSTRIALS, INC. STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS The statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements may include our statements regarding our goals, beliefs, strategies, objectives, plan, including product and service developments, future financial conditions, results or projections or current expectations. Such forward-looking statements may be identified by, among other things, the use of forward-looking terminology such as believes, estimates, intends, plan expects, may, will, should, predicts, anticipates, continues, or potential, or the negative thereof or other variations thereon or comparable terminology, and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. We remind readers that forward-looking statements are merely predictions and therefore inherently subject to uncertainties and other factors and involve known and unknown risks that could cause the actual results, performance, levels of activity, or our achievements, or industry results, to be materially different from any future results, performance, levels of activity, achievements, or industry results, expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Such uncertainties and risks include those discussed in the Risk Factors and similar sections of this Report on and our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, all of which are incorporated by reference herein. Forward-looking statements appear in Item 2 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, as well as elsewhere in this Quarterly Report. Our management has included projections and estimates in this Report, which are based primarily on management s experience in the industry, assessments of our results of operations, discussions and negotiations with third parties and a review of information filed by our competitors with the SEC or otherwise publicly available. We caution readers not to place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date made. We disclaim any obligation subsequently to revise any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of such statements or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events except as otherwise required by law. Unless otherwise specified or required by context, as used in this Report, the terms we, our, us and the Company refers collectively to Rocky Mountain Industrials, Inc., RMI formerly known as RMR Industrials, Inc., and its wholly/majority-owned subsidiaries, RMR Aggregates, Inc., RMR Logistics, Inc., and Rail Land Company, LLC. Unless otherwise indicated, the term common stock refers to shares of our Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock. Our financial statements are stated in United States Dollars (US and are prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP).

 CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING EXPLORATION STAGE STATUS AND USE OF CERTAIN MINING TERMS We are considered an exploration stage company under the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission SEC Industry Guide 7, Description of Property by Issuers Engaged or to be Engaged in Significant Mining Operations Guide 7 ), because we do not have reserves as defined under Guide 7. Reserves are defined in Guide 7 as that part of a mineral deposit which can be economically and legally extracted or produced at the time of the reserve determination. The establishment of reserves under Guide 7 requires, among other things, certain spacing of exploratory drill holes to establish the required continuity of mineralization and the completion of a detailed cost or feasibility study. Since we have no reserves as defined in Guide 7, we have not exited the exploration stage and continue to report our financial information as an exploration stage entity as required under relevant accounting principles. We will remain an exploration stage company under Guide 7 until such time as we demonstrate reserves in accordance with the criteria in Guide 7. Since we have no reserves, we will expense all mine construction costs, even though these expenditures are expected to have a future economic benefit in excess of one year. We will also expense our reclamation and remediation costs at the time the obligation is incurred. Companies that have reserves and have exited the exploration stage typically capitalize these costs, and subsequently amortize them on a units-of-production basis as reserves are mined, with the resulting depletion charge allocated to inventory, and then to cost of sales as the inventory is sold. As a result of these and other differences, our financial statements will not be comparable to the financial statements of mining companies that have established reserves and have exited the exploration stage. We use certain terms in this report such as production, mining or processing activities, and mine construction. Production means the estimated quantities (tonnage) delivered or shipped to our customers, which may result in disclosure of related limestone and dolomite sales. Mining or processing activities means the process of extracting limestone and dolomite from the earth and treating that material. Mine construction means work carried out to access areas in the mine containing limestone and dolomite, which principally includes road construction, ramp construction and ancillary activities. We use these terms in this report since we believe they are necessary and helpful for the reader to understand our business and operations. However, we caution you that we do not have reserves and therefore have not exited the exploration stage as defined in Guide 7, and our use of the terminology described above is not intended to indicate that we have established reserves or have exited the exploration stage for purposes of Guide 7. Furthermore, since we do not have reserves, we cannot provide any indication or assurance as to how long we will likely continue mining activities at our mine site or whether such activities will be profitable.

 PART I Item 1. Business Overview RMI s predecessor entity was incorporated in August 2012 as a Nevada corporation. We are an exploration stage company dedicated to operating industrial assets in the United States (U.S.) including minerals, materials and services. Our strategy is to become a key provider of industrial materials and services in the Rocky Mountain region. We utilize differentiated operational capabilities, which we believe will allow us to outperform conventional operators through diverse markets. We have a strategy to own, operate, develop, acquire and vertically integrate complementary industrial businesses. The experienced management team of RMI has a multi-cycle track record of operating industrial resource businesses. We operate the Mid-Continent Quarry in Garfield County, Colorado, producing chemical-grade calcium carbonate that currently services local and regional customers in a variety of end markets, including but not limited to mining, manufacturing, construction, and agriculture. The Mid-Continent Quarry, which is located outside the city of Glenwood Springs, consists of 44 unpatented mining claims owned by the Bureau of Land Management and controlled by RMI. The operation currently serves Arch Coal, local construction firms, and various city and county government construction projects. The quarry is currently undergoing an expansion and modernization effort. For the years ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, we produced and sold 16,232 and 25,474 tons of high-calcium limestone, respectively, from the Mid-Continent Quarry. Please reference Cautionary Note Regarding Exploration Stage Status and Use of Certain Mining Terms for disclosure concerning the current stage of our mineral explorations. We are also actively developing Rocky Mountain Rail Park (the Rail Park ), a dedicated rail-served industrial business park serving the greater Denver market. In February 2018, we acquired approximately 470 acres of land in Bennett, Colorado which serves as the foundation for the Rail Park. In July 2018, we exercised our option to acquire an additional approximately 150 acres for a total of 620 acres. The Company s development of the Rail Park is intended to expand the customer base for our products by utilizing rail freight capabilities to reach customers in the greater Denver area and by expanding our business to include rail transportation solutions and services. We intend to be the permanent owner and operator of the Rail Park and once operational, the facility will seek to establish a new industrial hub for rail transportation and related services serving Adams County, Colorado and the greater Denver metropolitan area. Purchaser interest has been strong after the unanimous approval by the Adams County Board of County Commissioners of the Final Development Plan and Final Plat in September 2020. Additionally, the Rail Park sold an 83 acre lot in January 2021, which has further positively impacted the interest in the property s remaining southern lots. Rail freight capabilities will allow the Mid-Continent Quarry s products to access the Denver market, where demand for calcium carbonate is currently strong and supply is relatively limited. The market opportunity is primarily centered on front range infrastructure demands, but also includes fertilizer, animal feed, and multiple other industrial applications. According to the USGS Natural Aggregates Statistics and information Colorado demand in 2020 for construction aggregate was approximately 51.8 million metric tons per year, comprised of 33.6 million metric tons of sand and gravel and 18.2 million metric tons of crushed stone. The area experiences supply shortages in peak seasons, creating a natural market for our products. We believe we are well-positioned to benefit from this market environment. In addition to developing and expanding our existing assets, we expect to supplement our growth with strategic acquisitions of related business and the integration these businesses to achieve economies of scale and synergies. We target companies in various sectors directed towards industrial and/or infrastructure applications, including but not limited to construction materials, industrial minerals, industrial resources, logistics solutions, and transportation.

 Competitive Strengths Our management team has extensive experience in investing in and operating natural resource assets. We believe our potential competitive strengths to be the following: Application of Management Expertise. Our team has expertise in engineering, operations, finance and general management within the industrials resource sector. Management Operating and Investing Experience . Over the course of their careers, the members of our management team have developed a broad international network of contacts and corporate relationships which we believe will serve as a useful source of investment opportunities. The management team has applied its deep understanding of historical precedents in the natural resource markets to the development of our business and strategy. Some of our management team members have been working together for the last ten years, and over that time have assembled a team of industrial resources and investment professionals to pursue investments across the industry. Revenues and Customers For the year ended March 31, 2021, approximately 84 of our consolidated revenue was from one customer. At March 31, 2021, approximately 43 of our accounts receivable were due from the same customer. Industry and Competition Limestone Limestone, or calcium carbonate is used in a variety of applications including coal mining, coal fired power plants, construction aggregates, glass bottle and steel manufacturing, and agriculture. Regional competitors include Pete Lien Sons, Inc., and United States Lime Minerals, Inc. Construction Aggregates Aggregates are key material components used in the production of cement, ready-mixed concrete and asphalt paving mixes for the residential, nonresidential and public infrastructure markets and are also widely used for various applications and products, such as road and building foundations, railroad ballast, erosion control, filtration, roofing granules and in solutions for snow and ice control. Generally extracted from the earth using surface or underground mining methods, aggregates are produced from natural deposits of various materials such as limestone, sand and gravel, granite and trap rock. Markets are typically local due to high transport costs and are generally fragmented, with numerous participants operating in localized markets. According to the 2019 U.S. Geological Survey, the U.S. market for these products was estimated at approximately 2.47 billion tons in 2019, an increase of 5 vs. 2018. Aggregates consumption is more heavily weighted towards public infrastructure and maintenance repair. However, the mix of end uses can vary widely by geographic location, based on the nature of construction activity in each market. Typically, three to six competitors comprise the majority market share in each local market because of constraints around the availability of natural resources and transportation. Regional competitors for construction aggregates in Colorado include Martin Marietta Materials, Inc., Albert Frei Sons, Inc., Aggregate Industries, Brannan Sand Gravel Co., LLC, L.G. Everist, Inc., and BURNCO. Environmental and Government Regulation Our operations are and will be subject to extensive federal, state and local laws, regulations and ordinances in the United States and abroad relating to the protection of the environment and human health and to safety, including those pertaining to chemical manufacture and distribution, waste generation, storage and disposal, discharges to waterways, and air emissions and various other health and safety matters. Governmental authorities have the power to enforce compliance with their regulations, and violators may be subject to civil, criminal and administrative penalties, injunctions or both. We

 will devote significant financial resources to ensure compliance. We believe that we are in substantial compliance with all the applicable laws and regulations. We anticipate that the regulation of our business operations under federal, state and local environmental laws in the United States and abroad will increase and become more stringent over time. We cannot estimate the impact of increased and more stringent regulation on our operations, future capital expenditure requirements or the cost of compliance. United States Regulation. Statutory programs relating to protection of the environment and human health and to safety in the United States include, among others, the following. CERCLA. The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended, also known as CERCLA and Superfund , and comparable state laws generally impose joint and several liability for costs of investigation and remediation and for natural resource damages, without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct, on certain classes of persons with respect to the release into the environment of specified substances, including under CERCLA those designated as hazardous substances. These potentially responsible parties include the present and certain former owners or operators of the site where the release occurred and those that disposed or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substance at the site. These liabilities can arise in association with the properties where operations were conducted, as well as disposal facilities where wastes were sent. Many states have adopted comparable or more stringent state statutes. In the course of our operations, we have generated materials that fall within CERCLA s definition of hazardous substances. We may also be the owner or operator of sites on which hazardous substances have been released and may have generated hazardous substances that have been transported to or otherwise released upon offsite facilities. We may be responsible under CERCLA for all or part of the costs to clean up facilities at which such substances have been released by previous owners or operators and offsite facilities to which our wastes were transported and for associated damages to natural resources. Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. The federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, as amended RCRA and comparable state laws regulate the treatment, storage, disposal, remediation and transportation of wastes, specifically under RCRA those designated as hazardous wastes. The EPA and various state agencies have limited the disposal options for these wastes and impose numerous regulations upon the treatment, storage, disposal, remediation and transportation of them. Our operations generate wastes that are subject to RCRA and comparable state statutes. Furthermore, wastes generated by our operations that are currently exempt from treatment as hazardous wastes may be designated in the future as hazardous wastes under RCRA or other applicable statutes and, therefore, may be subject to more rigorous and costly treatment, storage and disposal requirements. Governmental agencies (and in the case of civil suits, private parties in certain circumstances) can bring actions for failure to comply with RCRA requirements, seeking administrative, civil, or criminal penalties and injunctive relief, to compel us to abate a solid or hazardous waste situation that presents an imminent or substantial endangerment to health or the environment. Clean Water Act. The federal Clean Water Act imposes restrictions and strict controls regarding the discharge of pollutants, including dredged and fill materials into waters of the United States. Under the Clean Water Act, and comparable state laws, the government (and in the case of civil suits, private parties in certain circumstances) can bring actions for failure to comply with Clean Water Act requirements and enforce compliance through civil, criminal and administrative penalties for unauthorized discharges of hazardous substances and of other pollutants. In the event of an unauthorized discharge of pollutants, we may be liable for penalties and subject to injunctive relief. Clean Air Act . The federal Clean Air Act (CAA), as amended and comparable state and local laws restrict the emission of air pollutants from many sources and also impose various monitoring and reporting requirements. These laws may require us to obtain pre-approval for the construction or modification of certain projects or facilities expected to produce or significantly increase air emissions, obtain and strictly comply with air permit requirements or utilize specific equipment or technologies to control emissions. Governmental agencies (and in the case of civil suits, private parties in certain circumstances) can bring actions for failure to strictly comply with air pollution regulations or permits and generally enforce compliance through administrative, civil or criminal enforcement actions, resulting in fines, injunctive relief (which could include requiring us to forego construction, modification or operation of sources of air pollutants) and imprisonment. While we may be required to incur certain capital expenditures for air pollution control equipment or other air emissions-related issues, we do not believe that such requirements will have a material adverse effect on our operations.

 Greenhouse Gas Regulation . More stringent laws and regulations relating to climate change and greenhouse gases (GHGs) may be adopted in the future and could cause us to incur material expenses in complying with them. The EPA has begun to regulate GHGs as pollutants under the CAA. The EPA adopted rules to permit GHG emissions from stationary sources under the Prevention of Significant Deterioration and Title V permitting programs including the Prevention of Significant Deterioration and Title V Greenhouse Gas Tailoring Rule, requiring that the largest sources first obtain permits for GHG emissions. The United States Supreme Court, however, ruled in 2014 that the EPA did not have the authority to require permits for GHG emissions and also did not have the authority to adopt that rule. The EPA may not treat GHGs as an air pollutant for purposes of determining whether a source is a major source that is required to obtain a Prevention of Significant Deterioration or Title V permit. The Court did hold that if a source required a permit under the program because of other pollutants, the EPA had the authority to require that the source demonstrate that it would use the best available control technology to minimize GHG emissions that exceeded a minimal amount. Because of the lack of any comprehensive legislation program addressing GHGs, the EPA is using its existing regulatory authority to promulgate regulations requiring reduction in GHG emissions from various categories of sources, starting with fossil fuel-fired power plants. Specifically, in June 2019, the EPA issued the final Affordable Clean Energy ACE rule, which, among other things, establishes emission guidelines for states to develop plans to address GHG emissions from existing coal-fired power plants. The ACE rule replaces the Clean Power Plan that the EPA had issued in 2015. There is a great deal of uncertainty as to how and when additional federal regulation of GHGs might take place. Some members of Congress have expressed the intention to promote legislation to curb the EPA s authority to regulate GHGs. In addition to federal regulation, a number of states, individually and regionally, and localities also are considering implementing or have implemented GHG regulatory programs. These regional and state initiatives may result in so called cap and trade programs, under which overall GHG emissions are limited and GHG emission allowances are then allocated and sold to and between persons subject to the program. These and possibly other regulatory requirements could result in our incurring material expenses to comply, for example by being required to purchase or to surrender allowances for GHGs resulting from other operations or otherwise being required to control or reduce emissions. Health and Safety. Our operations are also governed by laws and regulations relating to workplace safety and worker health, principally regulations and requirements from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and Mine Safety and Health Administration MSHA ). The OSHA hazard communication standard, the EPA s community right-to-know regulations and similar state programs may require us to organize and/or disclose information about hazardous materials used or produced in our operations. Failure to comply with requirements from these laws and regulations can result in sanctions such as fines and penalties and claims for personal injury and property damage. These requirements may also result in increased operating and capital costs in the future. We believe that we are in substantial compliance with these requirements to extent applicable. Licenses, Permits and Product Registrations. Certain licenses, permits and product registrations are required for our products and operations in the United States. The licenses, permits and product registrations are subject to revocation, modification and renewal by governmental authorities. In the United States in particular, producers and distributors of chemicals such as penta and creosote are subject to registration and notification requirements under federal law (including under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act FIFRA and the Toxic Substances Control Act, and comparable state law) in order to sell those products in the United States. Compliance with these laws has had, and in the future will continue to have, a material effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Under FIFRA, the law s registration system requires an ongoing submission to the EPA of substantial scientific research and testing data regarding the chemistry and toxicology of pesticide products by manufacturers. Available Information We maintain a website at http://rockymountainindustrials.com/ that contains additional information about our Company. Employees We currently have 12 full-time employees.

 Item 1A. Risk Factors Risks Relating to Our Business We have incurred losses in prior periods and may incur losses in the future. We may not achieve or sustain profitability on a quarterly or annual basis in the future. Our operations are subject to the risks and competition inherent in the establishment of a business enterprise. There can be no assurance that future operations will be profitable. We may not achieve our business objectives and the failure to achieve such goals would have an adverse impact on us. Our future is dependent upon our ability to obtain financing. If we do not obtain such financing, we may have to cease our activities and investors could lose their entire investment. There is no assurance that we will operate profitably or generate positive cash flow in the future. We will require additional financing in order to proceed with our business plan and acquire existing businesses that manufacture and distribute chemicals and minerals. We will also require additional financing to sustain our business operations if we are not successful in earning revenues. We may not be able to obtain financing on commercially reasonable terms or terms that are acceptable to us when required. Our future is dependent upon our ability to obtain financing. If we do not obtain such financing, our business could fail and investors could lose their entire investment. Our business may fail, and investors may lose all of their investment in our Company. We are a company with a limited operating history and our future profitability is uncertain. We have yet to generate positive earnings and there can be no assurance that we will ever operate profitably. If our business plan is not successful and we are not able to operate profitably, then our stock may become worthless and investors may lose all of their investment in our Company. We anticipate that we will incur increased operating expenses prior to realizing significant revenues. We therefore expect to incur significant losses into the foreseeable future. We recognize that, if we are unable to generate significant revenues from the sale of our products in the future, we will not be able to earn profits or continue operations. There is no history upon which to base any assumption as to the likelihood that we will prove successful, and we can provide no assurance that we will generate any revenues or ever achieve profitability. If we are unsuccessful in addressing these risks, our business will fail, and investors may lose all of their investment in our Company. Our limited operating history makes evaluating our business and future prospects difficult and may increase the risk of your investment. Our limited operating history may not provide a meaningful basis on which to evaluate our business. We will continue to encounter risks and difficulties frequently experienced by companies at a similar stage of development, including our potential failure to: expand our product offerings and maintain the high quality of products offered; manage our expanding operations, including the integration of any future acquisitions; obtain sufficient working capital to support our expansion and to fill customers orders on time; maintain adequate control of our expenses; implement our product development, marketing, sales, and acquisition strategies and adapt and modify them as needed; and 
 5 

Table of Contents 
 anticipate and adapt to changing conditions in the markets in which we operate as well as the impact of any changes in government regulation, mergers and acquisitions involving our competitors, technological developments, and other significant competitive and market dynamics. 
 If we are not successful in addressing any or all of these risks, then our business may be materially and adversely affected. If we are unable to identify, fund and execute new acquisitions, we will not be able to execute a key element of our business strategy. Our strategy is to grow primarily by acquiring additional businesses and product lines. We cannot give any assurance that we will be able to identify, acquire or profitably manage additional businesses and product lines. Financing for acquisitions may not be available, or may be available only at a cost or on terms and conditions that are unacceptable to us. Further, acquisitions may involve a number of special risks or effects, including diversion of management s attention, failure to retain key acquired personnel, unanticipated events or circumstances, legal liabilities, impairment of acquired intangible assets and other one-time or ongoing acquisition-related expenses. Some or all of these special risks or effects could have a material adverse effect on our financial and operating results. In addition, we cannot assure you that acquired businesses or product lines, if any, will achieve anticipated revenues and earnings, or that we will not assume unanticipated liabilities. In addition, we may not be able to successfully or profitably integrate, operate, maintain and manage our newly acquired operations or their employees. We may not be able to maintain uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies, which may lead to operational inefficiencies. We may be unable to sell rail park lots when appropriate or at all because real estate is not as liquid as certain other types of assets. Real estate investments generally cannot be sold quickly, which could limit our ability to adjust our response to changes in economic conditions and affect the timing of sales or leases of rail park lots. This could adversely affect our financial condition and our ability to service debt Loss of key members of our management team could disrupt our business. We depend on the continued employment and performance of our senior executives and other key members of our management team. If any of these individuals resigns or becomes unable to continue in his or her present role and is not adequately replaced, our business operations and our ability to implement our growth strategies could be materially disrupted. The industries in which we compete are highly competitive, and we may not be able to compete effectively with our competitors that have greater financial resources, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. The industries in which we operate are highly competitive. Among our competitors are some of the world s largest chemical companies that have their own raw material resources. Changes in the competitive landscape could make it difficult for us to retain our competitive position. In addition, some of the companies with whom we compete may be able to produce products more economically than we can. Furthermore, most of our competitors have greater financial resources, which may enable them to invest significant capital into their businesses, including expenditures for research and development. Increases in the price of our primary raw materials may decrease our profitability and adversely affect our liquidity, cash flow, financial condition and results of operations. The prices we pay for raw materials in our businesses may increase significantly, and we may not always be able to pass those increases through to our customers fully and timely. In the future, we may be unable to pass on increases in our raw material costs, and raw material price increases may erode the profitability of our products by reducing our gross profit. Price increases for raw materials may also increase our working capital needs, which could adversely affect our liquidity

 and cash flow. For these reasons, we cannot assure you that raw material cost increases in our businesses would not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. The Company will operate in competitive environment which gives rise to operating and market risk exposure. The Company expects to sell a broad range of products and services in a competitive environment, and to compete for sales on the basis of product quality, price, technology and customer service. Increased levels of competition could result in lower prices or lower sales volume, which could have a negative impact on the Company s results of operations. Economic conditions around the world, and in certain industries in which the Company does business, also impact sales prices and volume. As a result, market uncertainty or an economic downturn in the geographic areas or industries in which we sell our products could reduce demand for these products and result in decreased sales volume, which could have a negative impact on our results of operations. In addition, volatility and disruption of financial markets could limit customers ability to obtain adequate financing to maintain operations, which could result in a decrease in sales volume and have a negative impact on our results of operations. The Company s business operations may also give rise to market risk exposure related to changes in interest rates, commodity prices and other market factors such as equity prices. Disruptions in production at our processing facilities, both planned and unplanned, may have a material impact on our business, results of operations and/or financial condition. Manufacturing and mining facilities in our industry are subject to planned and unplanned production shutdowns and outages. Unplanned production disruptions may occur for external reasons including natural disasters, weather, disease, strikes, transportation interruption, government regulation, political unrest or terrorism, or internal reasons, such as fire, unplanned maintenance or other problems. Alternative facilities with sufficient capacity may not be available, may cost substantially more or may take a significant time to increase production or qualify with our customers, each of which could negatively impact our business, results of operations and/or financial condition. Long-term production disruptions may cause our customers to seek alternative supply which could further adversely affect our profitability. We will expend large amounts of money for environmental compliance in connection with our operations. We are subject to stringent regulations under numerous U.S. federal, state, local and foreign environmental, health and safety laws and regulations relating to, among other things, the generation, storage, handling, discharge, disposition and stewardship of hazardous wastes and other materials. We will expend substantial funds to comply with such laws and regulations and have established a policy intended to minimize our emissions to the environment. Nevertheless, legislative, regulatory and economic uncertainties (including existing and potential laws and regulations pertaining to climate change) make it difficult for us to project future spending for these purposes and if there are changes to applicable regulatory requirements, we may be required to expend substantial additional funds to remain in compliance. We are subject to environmental clean-up costs, fines, penalties and damage claims that have been and continue to be costly. We are subject to the risk of lawsuits and regulatory actions in connection with current and former operations (including divested businesses) for breaches of environmental laws or regulations or in connection with clean-up obligations. Lawsuits and investigations may be initiated by public or private parties under various environmental laws, including with respect to off-site disposal at facilities where we have been identified as a potentially responsible party under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended, commonly referred to as CERCLA, or similar laws.

 Increased concerns regarding the safe use of chemicals in commerce and their potential impact on the environment have resulted in more restrictive regulations from local, state and federal governments and could lead to new regulations. Concerns regarding the safe use of chemicals in commerce and their potential impact on health and the environment reflect a growing trend in societal demands for increasing levels of product safety and environmental protection. These concerns could manifest themselves in stockholder proposals, preferred purchasing and continued pressure for more stringent regulatory intervention. These concerns could also influence public perceptions, the viability of the Company s products, the Company s reputation and the cost to comply with regulations. In addition, terrorist attacks and natural disasters have increased concerns about the security and safety of chemical production and distribution. These concerns could have a negative impact on the Company s results of operations. Local, state and federal governments continue to propose new regulations related to the security of chemical plant locations and the transportation of hazardous chemicals, which could result in higher operating costs. We work with dangerous materials that can injure our employees, damage our facilities and disrupt our operations. Some of our operations involve the handling of hazardous materials that may pose a risk of fire, explosion, or the release of hazardous substances. Such events could result from terrorist attacks, natural disasters, or operational failures, and might cause injury or loss of life to our employees and others, environmental contamination, and property damage. These events could lead a temporary shutdown of an affected plant, or portion thereof, and we could be subject to penalties or claims as a result. A disruption of our operations caused by these or other events could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Our ability to operate and/or expand our mining operations may be affected by our ability to secure proper permits. Environmental and zoning regulations have made it increasingly difficult for the aggregates industry to expand existing quarries and to develop new quarry operations. Our mining operations could be materially impacted from being unable to maintain existing permits to operate the quarry or being unable to secure new permits to support the expansion of the quarry. We may be subject to claims of infringement of the intellectual property rights of others, which could hurt our business. From time to time, we expect to face infringement claims from our competitors or others alleging that our processes or products infringe on their proprietary technologies. Any claims that our products or processes infringe the intellectual property rights of others, regardless of the merit or resolution of the claims, could cause us to incur significant costs in responding to, defending and resolving the claims, and may divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel from our business. If we are found to be infringing on the proprietary technology of others, we may be liable for damages, and we may be required to change our processes, redesign our products, pay others to use the technology or stop using the technology or producing the infringing product. Even if we ultimately prevail, the existence of the lawsuit could prompt our customers to switch to products that are not the subject of infringement suits. Risks Related to Our Common Stock and Our Status as a Public Company We will be required to incur significant costs and require significant management resources to evaluate our internal control over financial reporting as required under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and any failure to comply or any adverse result from such evaluation may have an adverse effect on our stock price. As a reporting company under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, we are required to evaluate our internal control over financial reporting under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 Section 404 ). Section 404 requires us to include an internal control report with the Annual Report on Form 10-K. This report must include management s assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of the fiscal year. This report 
 8 

Table of Contents 
 must also include disclosure of any material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting that we have identified. Failure to comply, or any adverse results from such evaluation could result in a loss of investor confidence in our financial reports and have an adverse effect on the trading price of our equity securities. Achieving continued compliance with Section 404 may require us to incur significant costs and expend significant time and management resources. We cannot assure you that we will be able to fully comply with Section 404. As a result, investors could lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have an adverse effect on the trading price of our securities, as well as subject us to civil or criminal investigations and penalties. Our founder and directors have voting control over the Company. Our founders, who are also directors of the Company, have significant ownership of the Company, including a majority of our voting stock. This gives them the ability to control most, if not all, Company decisions. Our founders as a group own, directly or indirectly, approximately 57 of the Company Class A Common Stock (the Company s voting capital stock), effectively giving them voting control over most, if not all, decisions submitted to a shareholder vote, including the election of our directors and mergers and other major transactions. Such concentration of ownership and control could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of the Company even when such a change of control would be in the best interests of the Company s other shareholders. Accordingly, other investors will have little voice in our management decisions and will exercise very little control over us. In addition, the applicable sections of the Nevada Revised Statutes provide that certain actions must be approved by a specified percentage of shareholders. In the event that the requisite approval of shareholders is obtained, dissenting shareholders would be bound by such vote. Accordingly, no persons should purchase any shares unless they are willing to entrust all aspects of control to our management. Indemnification rights held by our directors, officers and employees may result in substantial expenditures by our Company and may discourage lawsuits against our directors, officers, and employees. The indemnification obligations provided in our articles of incorporation and our bylaws to our directors and officers could result in the Company incurring substantial expenditures to cover the cost of settlement or damage awards against directors and officers, which we may be unable to recoup. These provisions and resulting costs may also discourage us from bringing a lawsuit against directors and officers for breaches of their fiduciary duties, and may similarly discourage the filing of derivative litigation by our shareholders against our directors and officers even though such actions, if successful, might otherwise benefit us and our shareholders. We may also provide indemnification rights to our employees with similar results. Trading in our stock is subject to regulatory restrictions that limit a shareholder s ability to buy and sell our stock. There is currently no active trading market for our stock, and applicable SEC and other rules may prevent such a market from developing. For example: Our stock is categorized as a penny stock under applicable SEC rules. SEC rules impose certain sales practice requirements on broker-dealers who sell penny stocks that do not apply to other securities, including a requirement that a broker-dealer deliver a standardized risk disclosure document prior to completing a transaction in a penny stock. Similarly, FINRA places certain restrictions on transactions involving low-priced securities, including our common stock. Our common stock is not listed on any national securities exchange, and it does not currently qualify for listing on any major exchange, including the New York Stock Exchange or Nasdaq. We have not timely filed all reports required to be filed by the rules of the SEC, which limits the ability of shareholders to sell our common stock in unregistered transactions in reliance on SEC Rule 144. 
 Each of these factors limits liquidity in the market for our common stock and may therefore make it more difficult for our shareholders to sell their stock. The lack of trading in our stock may in turn make it more difficult for us to raise capital

 through issuances of stock, as potential investors may be reluctant to invest given the difficulties they may face if they later choose to sell the stock they purchase. To date, we have not paid any cash dividends and no cash dividends will be paid in the foreseeable future. We do not anticipate paying cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future and we may not have sufficient funds legally available to pay dividends. Even if the funds are legally available for distribution, we may nevertheless decide not to pay any dividends. We presently intend to retain all earnings for our operations. If we issue additional shares in the future, it will result in the dilution of our existing shareholders. Our articles of incorporation authorize the issuance of up 2,150,000,000 shares, of which 2,000,000,000 are shares of Class A Common Stock, par value 0.001 per share, 100,000,000 are shares of Class B Common Stock, par value 0.001 per share, and 50,000,000 are shares of Preferred Stock, par value 0.001 per share. Our Board of Directors may choose to issue some or all of such shares to acquire one or more companies or properties and to fund our overhead and general operating requirements. The issuance of any such shares may reduce the book value per share and may contribute to a reduction in the market price of the outstanding shares of our common stock. If we issue any such additional shares, such issuance will reduce the proportionate ownership and voting power of all current shareholders. Further, such issuance may result in a change of control of our Company. We are an emerging growth company under the JOBS Act of 2012, and we cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies will make our common stock less attractive to investors. We are an emerging growth company, as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 JOBS Act ), and we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile. In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We are choosing to take advantage of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards. As a result, our financial statements may not be comparable to those of companies that comply with public company effective dates. We will remain an emerging growth company for up to five years, although we will lose that status sooner if our revenues exceed 1 billion, if we issue more than 1 billion in non-convertible debt in a three year period, or if the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds 700 million as of any May 30.

The Company through its subsidiary Rail Land Company, LLC, owns an approximate 620-acre parcel of real property located in Bennett, Colorado. The Company s development of the Rail Park is intended to expand the customer base for our products by utilizing rail freight capabilities to reach customers in the greater Denver area and by expanding our business to include rail transportation solutions and services Please reference Cautionary Note Regarding Exploration Stage Status and Use of Certain Mining Terms in Item 1 related to stage of our mineral explorations, all of which are without reserves, as defined by Guide 7. Background RMI, through its subsidiary, RMR Aggregates, Inc., owns 44 mining claims on Bureau of Land Management (BLM) property in Garfield County, Colorado. The mining claims encompass 880 acres (20 acres each) and are for chemical grade limestone found within the Leadville Limestone formation. RMI purchased the mining claims and the associated mining facilities and equipment from CalX Minerals in October of 2016. The mineral rights are controlled through unpatented mining claims, the extents of which are shown on Figure 1. RMI has the legal right to enter through the provisions of the 1872 Mining Law. The claims grant RMI the right to remove the minerals within each claim under a Plan of Operations which must be approved by the BLM. RMI does not have any surface rights or surface ownership with the claims. However, RMI may conduct surface activities and install structures on the surface so long as the approved Plan of Operations allows. There is no set duration or term to the mining claims. RMI retains the rights to the mining claims through the payment of claim renewal fees, to the BLM, in September of each year. Each of the 44 claims requires an annual renewal fee payment of 165 per claim. RMI is responsible for paying these claim renewal fees each year. All claims are listed below in Table 1.

Table of Contents 
 in which the Mid-Continent Quarry is located. The six claims cover a total of 120 acres. RMI operates the quarry within a 38-acre boundary stipulated by its CO DRMS permit. Additionally, RMI has additional exploration property consisting of the remaining 38 mining claims (760 acres) not currently included with the Mid-Continent Quarry. This property surrounds the Mid-Continent Quarry property with the majority of the acreage existing to the north and east of the Mid-Continent Limestone Quarry property (see Figure 1). The boundaries of the Mid-Continent Quarry and the exploration property follow the boundaries of the mining claims on which they are located. Figure 1 - Mid-Continent Quarry area map with mining claims Location and Access The Mid-Continent Quarry is located about 1 mile north of the city of Glenwood Springs in Garfield County, Colorado. Access to the quarry is provided by a BLM dirt road called Transfer Trail. The terrain of the location is dominated by a hillside with a slope that ranges between 2H:1V and 3H:1V. Vegetation is mostly composed of sparse grasses, shrubs, and evergreen trees.

 Geology and Mineralization The quarry area is located in the Leadville Limestone formation and is bound by an unnamed fault to the north and the West Glenwood Fault to the south. The limestone outcrops to the east and to the west creating a natural boundary for the edges of the deposit. The deposit is roughly tabular in nature, with a west-northwest to east-southeast strike and 10-30 dip to the south-southwest. The Leadville Limestone formation ranges from approximately 150-175 feet thick in the quarry area. Facilities RMI owns a limestone milling facility located within the 38-acre mining boundary. Additionally, RMI owns and operates various pieces of crushing, screening, and heavy mobile equipment used for extracting and sizing the limestone in the quarry. Current Status Shortly after RMI purchased the property, extensive site cleanup was performed. RMI performs daily activities related to the production of limestone. This work includes blasting rock, transporting rock with excavators and front-end loaders and crushing and screening rock into usable sized pieces. To perform these activities, RMI has incurred costs, and will continue to incur costs. These costs include payment for supplies, equipment, labor, and other associated expenses related to the extraction of limestone. The power at the site is provided by Glenwood Springs Utilities. RMI does not have a direct water connect and utilizes water transported to the site and purchased from nearby locations for all water needs. The quarry is currently in excellent working condition. Exploration of Property RMI has not performed any exploration drilling of its own on the property outside of the quarry. RMI has performed surface sampling of the limestone on sections of this property. Testing results from the surface sampling have shown the limestone in this property to be nearly identical in nature to the chemical grade limestone found in the quarry. Historical exploration drilling, occurring between 1958-1976, took place over large sections of the property outside of the quarry. Testing results from this drilling show the existence of chemical grade limestone like the limestone found in the quarry. There are no active plans for future exploration. The costs associated with our properties can be found in Note F to our consolidated financial statements. Item 3. Legal Proceedings Rocky Mountain Industrials, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiary RMR Aggregates, Inc. has a filed a lawsuit pending in the District Court of Garfield County, Colorado. The defendants include Garfield County and also the City of Glenwood Springs which voluntarily intervened. The claims include a request for judicial review of two Notices of Violation issued by Garfield County in 2019 and 2020 and the related decision of the Board of County Commissioners BOCC at a public meeting on April 22, 2019. RMI had also asserted related claims in federal court for violation of its Constitutional rights to procedural and substantive due process under 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1983 and for declaratory and injunctive relief due to preemption under federal law (the Federal Claims ). By stipulation of the parties, the federal court lawsuit was dismissed, and all of the Federal Claims were added to the state lawsuit in Garfield County District Court. RMI is not presently seeking monetary damages because Garfield County has thus far not sought to enforce its Notices of Violation, but RMI has reserved the right to seek monetary damages in the future.

 Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures The operation of the Mid-Continent Quarry is subject to regulation by MSHA under the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 (the Mine Act ). MSHA inspects the quarry on a regular basis and issues various citations and orders when it believes a violation has occurred under the Mine Act. Whenever MSHA issues a citation or order, it also generally proposes a civil penalty, or fine, related to the alleged violation. Citations or orders can be contested and appealed, and as part of that process, are often reduced in severity and amount, and are sometimes dismissed. Under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Dodd-Frank Act), the Company is required to present information regarding certain mining safety and health citations which MSHA has issued with respect to its aggregates mining operations in its periodic reports filed with the SEC. In evaluating this information, consideration should be given to factors such as: (i) the number of citations and orders will vary depending on the size of the quarry or mine and type of operations (underground or surface), (ii) the number of citations issued will vary from inspector to inspector and location to location, and (iii) citations and orders can be contested and appealed, and in that process, may be reduced in severity and amount, and are sometimes dismissed. The Company presents the following items regarding certain mining safety and health matters for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021: Total number of violations of mandatory health or safety standards that could significantly and substantially contribute to the cause and effect of a mine safety or health hazard under section 104 of the Mine Act for which the Company received a citation from MSHA a Section 104 S S Citations ). If MSHA determines that a violation of a mandatory health or safety standard is reasonably likely to result in a reasonably serious injury or illness under the unique circumstance contributed to by the violation, MSHA will classify the violation as a significant and substantial violation (commonly referred to as a S S violation).
 Total number of orders issued under section 104(b) of the Mine Act Section 104(b) Orders ). These orders are issued for situations in which MSHA determines a previous violation covered by a Section 104(a) citation has not been totally abated within the prescribed time period, so a further order is needed to require the mine operator to immediately withdraw all persons (except certain authorized persons) from the affected area of a quarry or mine.
 Total number of citations and orders for unwarrantable failure of the mine operator to comply with mandatory health or safety standards under Section 104(d) of the Mine Act Section 104(d) Citations and Orders ). These violations are similar to those described above, but the standard is that the violation could significantly and substantially contribute to the cause and effect of a safety or health hazard, but the conditions do not cause imminent danger, and the MSHA inspector finds that the violation is caused by an unwarranted failure of the operator to comply with the health and safety standards.
 Total number of flagrant violations under section 110(b)(2) of the Mine Act Section 110(b)(2) Violations ). These violations are penalty violations issued if MSHA determines that violations are flagrant , for which civil penalties may be assessed. A flagrant violation means a reckless or repeated failure to make reasonable efforts to eliminate a known violation of a mandatory health or safety standard that substantially and proximately caused, or reasonably could have been expected to cause, death or serious bodily injury.
 Total number of imminent danger orders issued under section 107(a) of the Mine Act Section 107(a) Orders ). These orders are issued for situations in which MSHA determines an imminent danger exists in the quarry or mine and results in orders of immediate withdrawal of all persons (except certain authorized persons) from the area of the quarry or mine affected by its condition until the imminent danger and the underlying conditions causing the imminent danger no longer exist.
 Total dollar value of MSHA assessments proposed. These are the amounts of proposed assessments issued by MSHA with each citation or order for the time period covered by the report. Penalties are assessed by MSHA according to a formula that considers a number of factors, including the mine operator s history, size, negligence, 

 15 

Table of Contents 
 gravity of the violation, good faith in trying to correct the violation promptly, and the effect of the penalty on the operator s ability to continue in business.
 Total number of mining-related fatalities. Mines subject to the Mine Act are required to report all fatalities occurring at their facilities unless the fatality is determined to be non-chargeable to the mining industry.
 Receipt of written notice from MSHA of a pattern (or a potential to have such a pattern) of violations of mandatory health or safety standards that are of such nature as could have significantly and substantially contributed to the cause and effect of other mine health or safety hazards under section 104(e) of the Mine Act. If MHSA determines that a mine has a pattern of these types of violations, or the potential to have such a pattern, MSHA is required to notify the mine operator of the existence of that fact.
 Legal actions pending as of the last day of the reporting period, initiated during the reporting period and resolved during the reporting period.
 The Federal Mine Safety and Health Review Commission (the Commission is an independent adjudicative agency that provides administrative trial and appellate review of legal disputes arising under the Mine Act.

Overview We were incorporated in the State of Nevada in August 2012 under the name Online Yearbook with the principal business objective of developing and marketing online yearbooks for schools, companies and government agencies. In November 2014, Rocky Mountain Resource Holdings, Inc. RMRH became our majority shareholder by acquiring 5,200,000 shares of our common stock (the Shares ), or 69.06 of the then issued and outstanding shares, pursuant to stock purchase agreements with Messrs. El Maraana and Salah Blal, our former officers and directors. The Shares were acquired for an aggregate purchase price of 357,670. In December 2014, we changed our name to RMR Industrials, Inc. and on January 1, 2020, the Company changed its name from RMR Industrials, Inc. to Rocky Mountain Industrials, Inc. In February 2015, (the Closing Date ), we entered into and consummated a merger transaction pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the Merger Agreement by and among the Company, OLYB Acquisition Corporation, a Nevada corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of the Company Merger Sub and RMR IP, Inc., a Nevada corporation RMR IP ). In accordance with the terms of Merger Agreement, on the Closing Date, Merger Sub merged with and into RMR IP (the Merger ), with RMR IP surviving the Merger as our wholly owned subsidiary. Chad Brownstein and Gregory M. Dangler are directors of the Company and co-owners of RMRH, which was the majority shareholder of the Company prior to the Merger. Additionally, Messrs. Brownstein and Dangler were indirect controlling shareholders and directors of RMR IP prior to the Merger. As such, the Merger was among entities under the common control of Messrs. Brownstein and Dangler. In July 2016, we formed RMR Aggregates, Inc., a Colorado corporation RMR Aggregates ), as our wholly-owned subsidiary. RMR Aggregates was formed to hold assets whose primary focus is the mining and processing of industrial minerals for the manufacturing, construction and agriculture sectors. These minerals include limestone, aggregates, marble, silica, barite and sand. In October 2016, pursuant to an Asset Purchase Agreement with CalX Minerals, LLC, a Colorado limited liability company CalX ), RMR Aggregates completed the purchase of substantially all of the assets associated with the Mid-Continent Quarry on 41 BLM unpatented placer mining claims in Garfield County, Colorado. CalX assets include the mining claims, improvements, access rights, water rights, equipment, inventory, contracts, permits, certain intellectual property rights, and other tangible and intangible assets associated with the limestone mining operation. In January 2018, the Company formed Rail Land Company, LLC Rail Land Company as a wholly-owned subsidiary to acquire and develop a rail terminal and services facility (the Rail Park ). Rail Land Company purchased an approximately 470-acre parcel of real property located in Bennett, Colorado in February, 2018. In July 2018 we exercised our option to acquire an additional approximately 150 acres for a total of 620 acres. The Company s development of the Rail Park is intended to expand the customer base for our products by utilizing rail freight capabilities to reach customers in the greater Denver area and by expanding our business to include rail transportation solutions and services. On April 26, 2019, RMR Logistics entered into an asset purchase agreement with H2K, LLC, a Colorado limited liability company the Seller pursuant to which RMR Logistics acquired the Seller s trucking assets.

 Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates, judgments, and assumptions that impact the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, and expenses, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates. Management considers many factors in selecting appropriate financial accounting policies and controls, and in developing the estimates and assumptions that are used in the preparation of these financial statements. Management must apply significant judgment in this process. In addition, other factors may affect estimates, including: expected business and operational changes, sensitivity and volatility associated with the assumptions used in developing estimates, and whether historical trends are expected to be representative of future trends. The estimation process may yield a range of potentially reasonable estimates of the ultimate future outcomes and management must select an amount that falls within that range of reasonable estimates. Although these estimates are based on the Company s knowledge of current events and actions it may undertake in the future, actual results may ultimately materially differ from those estimated amounts and assumptions used in the preparation of the financial statements. Segment Reporting Operating segments are identified as components of an enterprise about which separate discrete financial information is available for evaluation by the chief operating decision-maker in making decisions regarding resource allocation and assessing performance. As of March 31, 2021, the Company views its operations and manages its business as two operating segments, Aggregates and Rail Park. Cash and Cash Equivalents The Company considers all highly liquid securities with original maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. As of March 31, 2021, the Company had cash of approximately 1,622,000 and no cash equivalents. The Company may occasionally maintain cash balances in excess of amounts insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. The amounts are held with major financial institutions and are monitored by management to mitigate credit risk. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets The Company evaluates its long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable. Asset impairment is considered to exist if the total estimated future cash flows on an undiscounted basis are less than the carrying amount of the asset. Any impairment losses are measured and recorded based on discounted estimated future cash flows and are charged to income on the Company s consolidated statements of operations. In estimating future cash flows, assets are grouped at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of future cash flows from other asset groups. The Company s estimates of future cash flows are based on numerous assumptions, including expected commodity prices, production levels, capital requirements and estimated salvage values. It is possible that actual future cash flows will be significantly different than the estimates, as actual future quantities of recoverable material, future commodity prices, production levels and costs and capital are each subject to significant risks and uncertainties. As of March 31, 2021, the Company s mineral resources do not meet the definition of proven or probable reserves or value beyond proven or probable reserves and any potential revenue has been excluded from the cash flow assumptions. Accordingly, recoverability of the long-lived assets capitalized cost is based primarily on estimated salvage values or alternative future uses. Fair Value Measurements The fair value of a financial instrument is the amount that could be received upon the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Financial assets are marked to bid prices and financial liabilities are marked to offer prices. Fair value measurements do not include transaction costs. A fair value hierarchy is used to prioritize the quality and reliability of the information used to determine fair 
 19 

Table of Contents 
 values. Categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The fair value hierarchy is as follows: - Level 1: Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities - Level 2: Observable market-based inputs or inputs that are corroborated by market data - Level 3: Unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data Revenue Recognition As of January 1,2018, we adopted ASU NO. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers Topic 606. The Company recognizes revenues upon delivery of goods to the customer at which time the Company s performance obligation is satisfied at an amount that the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods in accordance with the five step analysis outlined in Topic 606: (i) identify the contract with the customer, (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract, (iii) determine the transaction price, (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations, and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) performance obligations are satisfied. Revenue includes product sales of limestone, aggregate materials and other transportation charges to customers net of discounts, allowance or taxes, as applicable. Accrued Reclamation Liability The Company incurs reclamation liabilities as part of its mining activities. Quarry activities require the removal and relocation of significant levels of overburden to access materials of usable quantity and quality. The same overburden material is used to reclaim depleted mine areas, which must be sloped to a certain gradient and seeded to prevent erosion in the future. Reclamation methods and requirements can differ depending on the quarry and state rules and regulations in existence for certain locations. As of March 31, 2021, the Company s undiscounted reclamation obligations totaled approximately 222,000, which is expected to be settled within the next 20 years. Reclamation costs resulting from the normal use of long-lived assets, either owned or leased, are recognized over the period the asset is in use. The obligation, which cannot be reduced by estimated offsetting cash flows, is recorded at fair value as a liability at the obligating event date and is accreted through charges to operating expenses. The fair value is based on our estimate for a third party to perform the legally required reclamation tasks including a reasonable profit margin. This fair value is also capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the underlying asset and depreciated over the estimated useful life of the asset. The mining reclamation reserve is based on management s estimate of future cost requirements to reclaim property at its operating quarry site. Costs are estimated in current dollars and inflated until the expected time of payment using a future estimated inflation rate and then discounted back to present value using a credit-adjusted, risk-free rate on obligations of similar maturity adjusted to reflect our credit rating. The Company will review reclamation liabilities at least every three years for a revision to the cost or a change in the estimated settlement date. Additionally, reclamation liabilities are reviewed in the period that a triggering event occurs that would result in either a revision to the cost or a change in the estimated settlement date. Examples of events that would trigger a change in the cost include a new reclamation law or amendment to an existing mineral lease. Examples of events that would cause a change in the estimated settlement date include the acquisition of additional reserves or early or delayed closure of a site. Any affect to earnings from cost revisions is included in cost of revenue. Net Loss per Common Share Basic net loss per common share is calculated by dividing the net loss attributable to common stockholders, after deducting preferred dividends, by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period, without consideration of the potentially dilutive effects of converting stock options or restricted stock purchase rights outstanding. Diluted net loss per common share is calculated by dividing the net loss attributable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period and the potential dilutive effects of stock options or restricted stock purchase rights outstanding during the period determined using the treasury stock method. In 
 20 

Table of Contents 
 periods in which the Company reports a net loss attributable to common stockholders, diluted net loss per share attributable to common stockholders is the same as basic net loss per share attributable to common stockholders since dilutive common shares are not assumed to have been issued, as their effect is anti-dilutive. Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method, which requires, among other things, that deferred income taxes be provided for temporary differences between the tax bases of the Company s assets and liabilities and their financial statement reported amounts. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined on the basis of the differences between the financial statements and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is recorded by the Company when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. In making such a determination, management considers all available positive and negative evidence, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the amount of the valuation allowance. When the Company establishes or reduces the valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets, its provision for income taxes will increase or decrease, respectively, in the period such determination is made. Additionally, the Company recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefit recognized in the financial statements for a particular tax position is based on the largest benefit that is more likely than not to be realized upon settlement. Accordingly, the Company establishes reserves for uncertain tax positions. The Company has not recognized interest or penalties in its statement of operations and comprehensive loss since inception.

 Revenues Revenues for the year ended March 31, 2021 were, 680,225, compared to sales of 1,084,113 for the same period in the year ended March 31, 2020. The decrease in revenues from the prior year is a result of reduced customer sales. Cost of Goods Sold Cost of goods sold for the year ended March 31, 2021, was 699,087, compared to 955,901 for the year ended March 31, 2020. The decrease in cost of goods sold corresponds to the reduction in associated revenues. Selling, general and administrative Operating expenses for the year ended March 31, 2021 were 12,132,761, compared to operating expenses for the year ended March 31, 2020 of 11,856,820. Selling, general and administrative expenses consisted of corporate overhead costs related to mining operations, consulting services from related parties, public company costs and amortization of intangible assets. The increase is primarily related to the Company increasing staffing largely in relation to the Company s Rail Park project. Interest expense, net Interest increased as a result of an increase in average outstanding debt and higher average interest rates during the year. Liquidity and Capital Resources As of March 31, 2021, we had current assets of 5,876,052, total current liabilities of 8,475,523 and a working capital deficit of 2,599,471. We have incurred an accumulated loss of 57,367,534 since inception. In past years, the Company funded operations by using cash proceeds received through the issuance of common and preferred stock and proceeds from debt financing. However, several significant transactions have occurred over the last 12 months that have positively impacted the net financial position of the Company and strengthened its financial position and its ability to meet future obligation over the next 12 months without a need to raise additional funds as it has traditionally been required to do. These include: 1. Rail Park FDP and Final Plat were unanimously approved by the Adams County Board of County Commissioners on September 1, 2020, paving the way for lot sales and construction. 
 2. On January 14, 2021, the Company sold an 83-acre lot to a Fortune 500 company for a gross sales price of 9.1M. This purchase was the first of twelve available lots in the Rail Park. Lot sales will be a primary source of cash inflows for the Company with significant interest from many potential light and heavy industrial tenants. 
 3. The RMRP Metro District bond offering closed on April 15, 2021, raising total proceeds of approximately 65.2M. These bond proceeds will fund the public infrastructure costs of the Rail Park. Total Rail Park project cost have been budgeted at between 60M and 75M of which approximately 75 is considered public infrastructure and therefore not an obligation of the Company. The Company is responsible for the remaining approximately 25 . 
 4. Construction on the south parcels of the Rail Park (approximately 150 acres) began in April 2021. The Company has in place a construction loan facility of 12M to fund it portion of construction costs (i.e., those not funded with Metro District bond proceeds).

 5. To date the Company has received approximately 2M as reimbursement of pre-construction costs that were incurred prior to the closing of the Bond Offering in April. 
 6. In September 2021, the Company sold its water rights underlying the Rail Park, to the Metro District for approximately 5.9M.

Financial Statements and Supplementary Data See Index to Consolidated Financial Statements on page 39. Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure Not applicable. Item 9A. Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures As of the end of the period covered by this report, we conducted an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act). Based upon this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective due to the material weakness described below. Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. The Company maintains internal controls over financial reporting that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the Company s SEC reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the internal controls over financial reporting, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Under the supervision and with the participation of management, including the Company s principal executive officer and principal financial officer, the Company conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. This evaluation included an assessment of the design of the Company s internal control over financial reporting and testing of the operational effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that, as of 
 23 

Table of Contents 
 March 31, 2021, our internal controls over financial reporting were not effective at the reasonable assurance level due to the material weakness discussed below. In light of the material weaknesses described below, we performed additional analysis and other post-closing procedures to ensure that our consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Accordingly, we believe that the consolidated financial statements included in this report fairly present, in all material respects, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented. This report does not include an attestation report of our independent registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management s report was not subject to attestation by our independent registered public accounting firm pursuant to rules of the SEC that permit us to provide only management s report in this report. Material Weakness and Related Remediation Initiatives Our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that as of March 31, 2021, due to the Company s budget constraints, the Company s accounting department does not maintain the number of accounting personnel (either in-house or external) necessary to ensure more complete and effective financial reporting controls. Due to this situation, we did not perform timely and sufficient internal or external review of our current fiscal year financial reporting, which resulted in untimely financial statement filings. It is reasonably possible that, if not remediated, this material weakness could result in a material misstatement in our reported financial statements in a future annual or interim period. We are developing an action plan for this material weakness, which involves hiring qualified accounting personnel and establishing a formal audit committee. We are uncertain at this time of the costs required to remediate the material weakness. Because the remedial actions will require the hiring of additional personnel, and extensive reliance on manual review and approval, the successful operation of the controls for at least several quarters may be required before management is able to conclude that the material weakness has been remediated. We intend to continue to evaluate and strengthen our internal control over financial reporting systems. These efforts require significant time and resources. If we are unable to establish effective internal control over our financial reporting, we may encounter difficulties in the audit or review of our financial statements by our independent registered public accounting firm, which in turn may have a material adverse effect on our ability to prepare financial statements in accordance with GAAP and to comply with our SEC reporting obligations. Inherent Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls Management does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control systems are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, no evaluation of internal control over financial reporting can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been or will be detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Projections of any evaluation of controls effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures.

 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting The following change in our internal control over financial reporting will materially affect, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. The Company subsequently employed a dedicated Chief Financial Officer in March 2021. Part of the role of the Chief Financial Officer is to address the Company s compliance with new accounting pronouncements and to work to implement and establish applicable controls and processes within the organization.

 Legal fees paid by the Company to Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck, LLP in the year ended March 31, 2021, were 266,050. Board Composition Our By-Laws provide that the Board of Directors shall consist of not less than one (1) nor more than fifteen (15) directors. Each director of the Company serves until his successor is elected and qualified, subject to removal by the Company s majority shareholders. Officers shall hold their offices for such terms and shall exercise such powers and perform such duties as shall be determined by the Board of Directors, and each officer shall hold his office until his successor is elected and qualified, or until his earlier resignation or removal. Audit Committee Our Board of Directors has not established a separate audit committee within the meaning of Section 3(a)(58)(A) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ). Instead, the entire Board of Directors acts as the audit committee and will continue to do so until such time as a separate audit committee is established. Code of Ethics The Company has adopted a Code of Ethics applicable to all Company directors, officers and employees which is available upon written request to the Company at c/o Rocky Mountain Industrials, Inc., 4601 DTC Blvd., Suite 130, Denver, Colorado, 80237. Potential Conflicts of Interest Since we do not have an audit or compensation committee comprised of independent directors, the functions that would have been performed by such committees are performed by our Board of Directors as a whole. Thus, there is a potential conflict of interest in that our directors and officers have the authority to determine issues concerning management compensation and audit issues that may affect management decisions. Involvement in Certain Legal Proceedings No director, executive officer, significant employee or control person of the Company has been involved in any legal proceeding listed in Item 401(f) of Regulation S-K in the past 10 years. Nominations to the Board of Directors Our directors play a critical role in guiding our strategic direction and oversee the management of the Company. Board candidates are considered based upon various criteria, such as their broad-based business and professional skills and experiences, a global business and social perspective, concern for the long-term interests of the shareholders, diversity, and personal integrity and judgment In addition, directors must have time available to devote to Board activities and to enhance their knowledge in the growing business. Accordingly, we seek to attract and retain highly qualified directors who have sufficient time to attend to their substantial duties and responsibilities to the Company. In carrying out its responsibilities, the Board will consider candidates suggested by shareholders. If a shareholder wishes to formally place a candidate s name in nomination, however, he or she must do so in accordance with the provisions of the Company s Bylaws. Suggestions for candidates to be evaluated by the directors must be sent to the Board of Directors, c/o Rocky Mountain Industrials, Inc., 4601 DTC Blvd., Suite 130, Denver, Colorado. During the year ended March 31, 2021, we did not effect any material changes to the procedures by which our shareholders may recommend nominees to our Board of Directors.

Opinion on the Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Rocky Mountain Industrials, Inc. as of March 31, 2021 and 2020, the related statements of operations, stockholders equity (deficit), and cash flows for the years then ended, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements ). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of March 31, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. Our audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

The mining reclamation reserve is based on management s estimate of future cost requirements to reclaim property at its operating quarry site. Costs are estimated in current dollars and inflated until the expected time of payment using a future estimated inflation rate and then discounted back to present value using a credit-adjusted, risk-free rate on obligations of similar maturity adjusted to reflect our credit rating. The Company will review reclamation liabilities at least every for a revision to the cost or a change in the estimated settlement date. Additionally, reclamation liabilities are reviewed in the period in which a triggering event occurs that would result in either a revision to the cost or a change in the estimated settlement date. Examples of events that would trigger a change in the cost include a new reclamation law or amendment to an existing mineral lease. Examples of events that would cause a change in the estimated settlement date include the acquisition of additional reserves or early or delayed closure of a site. Any affect to earnings from cost revisions is included in cost of revenue. A reconciliation of the carrying amount of our accrued reclamation liabilities is as follows: Liabilities incurred Accretion expense Balance at March 31, 2021 acres including open space and other right-of-way areas and providing ongoing operations and maintenance services related to the public improvements.
