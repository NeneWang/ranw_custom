Liquidity
and Capital Reserve 

Since
commencing operations, our working capital needs are generated from operations, and we had generated cash flow 324,521 and 15,588 in
year 2021 and 2020 respectively. 

We
are in start-up stage operations and have generated limited revenues. Our business is subject to risks inherent in the establishment
of a new business enterprise, including limited capital resources and possible cost overruns due to price and cost increases in services
and products. 

We
expect that we will be able to meet our needs to fund operations, capital expenditures and other commitments in the next 12 months primarily
with our cash and cash equivalents, operating cash flows. 

We
may, however, require additional cash resources due to changes in business conditions or other future developments. If these sources
are insufficient to satisfy our cash requirements, we may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain a credit facility.
The sale of additional equity or equity-linked securities could contractual result in additional dilution to stockholders. The incurrence
of indebtedness would result in increased debt service obligations and could result in operating and financial covenants that would restrict
operations. Financing may not be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, or at all. 

The
following table provides selected financial data about our Company as of May 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Actual results may differ from these estimates, and such differences may
be material.

flows for the year ended May 31, 2021 and 2020, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 

Basis
for Opinion 

These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s
financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal
securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company
is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits
we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion
on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our
audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error
or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

Going
Concern 

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note
2 to the financial statements, the Company has suffered recurring losses from operations and has a net capital deficiency that raise
substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. Management s plans in regard to these matters
also are described in Note 2. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

Critical
Audit Matters

or required to be communicated to the Board of Directors (Those Charged with Governance) that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures
that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgements. The communication
of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating
the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which
they relate.

NOTE
2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 

Basis
of presentation and liquidation 

The
condensed consolidated balance sheets as of May 31, 2021 and May 31, 2020 and the condensed consolidated statements of operations and
comprehensive income (loss), shareholders equity, and cash flow for the year ended May 31, 2021 and 2020 have been prepared by
the Company is in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States US GAAP ). 

The
Company incurred net loss of 1,875,008 and 682,466 during the year ended May 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. As of May31, 2021 and
May 31, 2020, the Company had an accumulated deficit of 2,613,173 and 738,165, respectively. Although it was loss in these two years,
the Company generated net cash inflow from operations of 324,521 and 15,588 during the year ended May 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. 

As
of May 31, 2021 and May 31, 2020, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of 340,109 and 15,588, the current liability of 3,434,867.
The Company s China subsidiaries and VIE are subject to preapproval from the State Administration of Foreign Exchange SAFE for non-domestic financing. Additionally, the amount of cash available for transfer from the China subsidiaries and the VIE for use by
the Company s non-China subsidiaries is also limited both by the liquidity needs of the subsidiaries in China and the restriction
on foreign currency exchange by Chinese-government mandated limitations including currency exchange controls on certain transfers of
funds outside of China. 

The
company currently is seeking to restructure the terms of our liabilities by raising funds to pay off liabilities. Our ability to continue
as a going concern is depend upon obtaining the necessary financing or negotiating the terms of the existing borrowing to meet our current
and future liquidity need. 

Going
Concern Uncertainties 

The
accompanies financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. The company having accumulated
deficit of 2,624,407 and 738,165 as of May 31, 2021 and May 31, 2020 respectively. For the year ended May 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company
suffered from a net loss of 1,886,242 and 682,466 respectively. Furthermore, the Company recorded a positive cash flows of 324,521
and 15,588 as of May 31, 2021 and 2020 respectively. 

The
Company s cash position is significant to support the Company s daily operation. While the Company believes in the viability
of its strategy and in its ability to raise additional funds, there can be no assurance to that effect. The Company s ability to
continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to improve profitability and the ability to acquire financial support from
its major shareholder. 

These
and other factors raise substantial doubts about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the
date that financial statements are issued. These financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect he possible future effects
on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amount and classification of liabilities that may result in the Company not
being able to continue as a going concern.

in China via its VIE, which hold critical operating licenses that enable the Company to do business in China. Substantially all of the
Company s revenues, costs and net income (loss) in China are directly or indirectly generated through these VIE. The Company has
signed various agreements with its VIE and legal shareholders of the VIE to allow the transfer of economic benefits from the VIE to the
Company and to direct the activities of the VIE. 

The
Company believes that the contractual arrangements among its subsidiaries, the VIE and its shareholders are in compliance with the current
PRC laws and legally enforceable. However, uncertainties in the interpretation and enforcement of the PRC laws, regulations and policies
could limit the Company s ability to enforce these contractual arrangements. As a result, the Company may be unable to consolidate
the VIE and its subsidiary in the consolidated financial statements. The Company s ability to control its VIE also depends on the
authorization by the shareholders of the VIE to exercise voting rights on all matters requiring shareholders approval in the VIE.
The Company believes that the agreements on authorization to exercise shareholder s voting power are legally enforceable. In addition,
if the legal structure and contractual arrangements with its VIE were found to be in violation of any future PRC laws and regulations,
the Company may be subject to fines or other actions. The Company believes the possibility that it will no longer be able to control
and consolidate its VIE as a result of the aforementioned risks and uncertainties is remote. 

The
following table sets forth its subsidiaries and the VIE, including their country of incorporation or residence and our ownership interest
in such subsidiaries. Please see Note 4 VIE Structure and Arrangement .

Accounts
Receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts 

Accounts
receivable are stated at the historical carrying amount net of allowance for doubtful accounts. 

The
Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts which reflects its best estimate of amounts that potentially will not be collected.
The Company determines the allowance for doubtful accounts taking into consideration various factors including but not limited to historical
collection experience and credit-worthiness of the debtors as well as the age of the individual receivables balance. Additionally, the
Company makes specific bad debt provisions based on any specific knowledge the Company has acquired that might indicate that an account

forecasted consumer demand, and promotional environment. The Company takes ownership, risks and rewards of the products purchased. 

F- 12 

(i)
Prepayments 

Prepayments
are mainly consisted of prepaid income tax, rental, prepayments for consulting fee and advances to supplies. 

(j)
Intangible assets, net 

The
Company s intangible assets with definite useful lives primarily consist of software, non-patent technology and land use right.
The Company typically amortizes its software and non-patent technology with definite useful lives on a straight-line basis over the shorter
of the contractual terms or the estimated useful lives. 

According
to the law of PRC, the government owns all the land in the PRC. Companies or individuals are authorized to possess and use the land only
through land use rights granted by the Chinese government for a specified period of time. The Company amortizes its land use rights using
the straight-line method over the periods the rights are granted. 

The
estimated useful lives are as follow: 

Software
 
 3
 years 

(k)
Impairment of long-lived assets other than goodwill 

The
Company evaluates its long-lived assets, including fixed assets and intangible assets with finite lives, for impairment whenever events
or changes in circumstances, such as a significant adverse change to market conditions that will impact the future use of the assets,
indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable. When these events occur, the Company evaluates the recoverability
of long-lived assets by comparing the carrying amount of the assets to the future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the
use of the assets and their eventual disposition. If the sum of the expected undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying amount
of the assets, the Company recognizes an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount of the assets over their fair value.
Fair value is generally determined by discounting the cash flows expected to be generated by the assets, when the market prices are not
readily available. 

For
all periods presented, there was no impairment of any of the Company s long-lived assets. 

(l)
Fair value of financial instruments 

The
Company s financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents, amount due from/to related parties, merchant deposits, payable
to merchants. The carrying values of these financial instruments approximate their fair values due to their short-term maturities. 

The
Company applies ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, ASC 820 ). ASC 820 defines fair value, establishes a
framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. ASC 820 requires disclosures to be provided
on fair value measurement. 

ASC
820 establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows: 

Level
1 Observable inputs that reflect quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets. 

Level
2 Other inputs that are directly or indirectly observable in the marketplace. 

Level
3 Unobservable inputs which are supported by little or no market activity. 

ASC
820 describes three main approaches to measuring the fair value of assets and liabilities: (1) market approach; (2) income approach;
and (3) cost approach. The market approach uses prices and other relevant information generated from market transactions involving identical
or comparable assets or liabilities. The income approach uses valuation techniques to convert future amounts to a single present value
amount. The measurement is based on the value indicated by current market expectations about those future amounts. The cost approach
is based on the amount that would currently be required to replace an asset.

Revenue recognition 

Effective
March 20, 2017, the Company early adopted ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASC Topic 606). Under Topic 606, revenues
are recognized when the promised products have been confirmed of delivery or services have been transferred to the consumers in amounts
that reflect the consideration the customer expects to be entitled to in exchange for those services. The Company presents value added
taxes VAT as reductions of revenues. The Company recognizes revenues net of value added taxes VAT and
relevant charges. 

Product
Revenue 

We
generate revenue primarily from the sales of automobile exhaust cleaners and auto parts directly to members. We recognize product revenue
at a point in time when the control of the products has been transferred to customers. The transfer of control is considered complete
when products have been picked up by or shipped to our customers. Our sales arrangements for automobile exhaust cleaners and auto parts
usually require a full prepayment before the delivery of products. 

We
also generate revenue from the sales of auto parts directly to the members, such as a business or individual engaged in auto parts businesses.
We recognize revenue at a point in time when products are delivered and customer acceptance is made. For the sales arrangements of auto
parts products, we generally require payment upon issuance of invoices.

(q)
Operating Leases 

Prior
to the adoption of ASC 842 on January 1, 2019: 

Leases,
mainly leases of factory buildings, offices and employee dormitories, where substantially all the rewards and risks of ownership of assets
remain with the lessor are accounted for as operating leases. Payments made under operating leases are recognized as an expense on a
straight-line basis over the lease term. The Company had no finance leases for any of the periods stated herein. 

Upon
and hereafter the adoption of ASC 842 on January 1, 2019: 

The
Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Operating leases are included in operating lease right-of-use ROU assets, operating lease liability, and operating lease liability, non-current in the Company s consolidated balance sheets. Please
refer to Note 2-Recently adopted accounting pronouncements for the disclosures regarding the Company s method of adoption of ASC
842 and the impacts of adoption on its consolidated balance sheets, results of operations and cash flows. ROU assets represent the Company s
right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the Company s obligation to make lease payments
arising from the lease. Operating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of
lease payments over the lease term. When determining the lease term, the Company includes options to extend or terminate the lease when
it is reasonably certain that it will exercise that option, if any. As the Company s leases do not provide an implicit rate, the
Company used an incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of
lease payments. The Company has elected to adopt the following lease policies in conjunction with the adoption of ASU 2016-02: (i) for
leases that have lease terms of 12 months or less and does not include a purchase option that is reasonably certain to exercise, the
Company elected not to apply ASC 842 recognition requirements; and (ii) the Company elected to apply the package of practical expedients
for existing arrangements entered into prior to January 1, 2019 to not reassess (a) whether an arrangement is or contains a lease, (b)
the lease classification applied to existing leases, and(c) initial direct costs. 

(r)

is 17 for the period from the beginning of 2018 till the end of April 2018, then changed to 16 from May 2018 to the end of March 2019,
and changed to 13 from April 2019. Entities that are VAT general taxpayers are allowed to offset qualified input VAT paid to suppliers
against their output VAT liabilities. Net VAT balance between input VAT and output VAT is recorded as VAT payable if output VAT is larger
than input VAT and is recorded as VAT recoverables if input VAT is larger than output VAT. All of the VAT returns filed by the Company s
subsidiaries in China, have been and remain subject to examination by the tax authorities. 

(s)
Income taxes 

The
Company followed the liability method of accounting for income taxes in accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes, or ASC 740. Under this
method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets
and liabilities using enacted tax rates that will be in effect in the period in which the differences are expected to reverse. The Company
recorded a valuation allowance to offset deferred tax assets if based on the weight of available evidence, it is more-likely-than-not
that some portion, or all, of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rate is recognized
in tax expense in the period that includes the enactment date of the change in tax rate. 

The
Company accounted for uncertainties in income taxes in accordance with ASC 740. Interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefit
recognized in accordance with ASC 740 are classified in the consolidated statements of comprehensive loss as income tax expense.

(u) Comprehensive income (loss) 

Comprehensive income (loss) is defined as the changes
in equity of the Company during a period from transactions and other events and circumstances excluding transactions resulting from investments
by owners and distributions to owners. Among other disclosures, ASC 220, Comprehensive Income, requires that all items that are required
to be recognized under current accounting standards as components of comprehensive income be reported in a financial statement that is
displayed with the same prominence as other financial statements. For each of the periods presented, the Company s comprehensive
income (loss) includes net loss and foreign currency translation adjustment and is presented in the consolidated statements of operations
and comprehensive income (loss). 

(v) Loss per share 

Basic loss per share is computed by dividing net loss
attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period using the two-class
method. Under the two-class method, net loss is allocated between ordinary shares and other participating securities based on their participating
rights. Diluted loss per share is calculated by dividing net loss attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number
of ordinary and dilutive ordinary equivalent shares outstanding during the period. Ordinary equivalent shares consist of shares issuable
upon the exercise of share options using the treasury stock method. Ordinary equivalent shares are not included in the denominator of
the diluted loss per share calculation when inclusion of such shares would be anti-dilutive. 

(u) Segment reporting 

The Company follows ASC 280, Segment Reporting. The
Company s Chief Executive Officer as the chief operating decision-maker reviews the consolidated financial results when making decisions
about allocating resources and assessing the performance of the Company as a whole and hence, the Company has only one reportable segment.
The Company operates and manages its business as a single segment. As the Company s long-lived assets are substantially all located
in the PRC and substantially all the Company revenues are derived from within the PRC, no geographical segments are presented. 

(w) Recent accounting pronouncements 

In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) ASU 2016-02 ), as amended, which generally requires
lessees to recognize operating and financing lease liabilities and corresponding right-of-use assets on the balance sheet and to provide
enhanced disclosures surrounding the amount, timing and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leasing arrangements. The Company adopted
the new standard effective January 1, 2019 and elected the package of practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance, which
allows to carryforward our historical lease classification, and initial direct costs for any leases that exist prior to adoption of the
new standard. The Company will also keep leases with an initial term of 12 months or less off the balance sheet and recognize the associated
lease payments in the consolidated statements of income on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The Company estimates approximately
US 374,341 would be recognized as total right-of-use assets and total lease liabilities on its consolidated balance sheet as of June 1,
2019. Other than additional disclosure, the Company does not expect the new standard to have a material impact on its consolidated financial
statements.

ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS
ON FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE 

None. 

ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Our management, with the participation and supervision
of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, are responsible for our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to
Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act. Disclosure controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed
to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized
and reported, within the time periods specified under SEC rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include controls and procedures
designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated
to our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer
and Chief Financial Officer, carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of May 31, 2021.
Based on this evaluation, our management concluded that as of May 31, 2021 these disclosure controls and procedures were not effective
at the reasonable assurance level. As discussed below, our internal control over financial reporting is an integral part of our disclosure
controls and procedures. 

Management s Annual Report on Internal Control
over Financial Reporting 

Our management is responsible for establishing and
maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Internal control
over financial reporting is a process, including policies and procedures, designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability
of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles. 

Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer
performed an evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting under the framework in Internal Control Integrated Framework
(2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. 

Based on the results of this assessment, our management
concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of May 31, 2021, based on such criteria. Deficiencies
existed in the design or operation of our internal controls over financial reporting that adversely affected our internal controls and
that may be considered to be material weaknesses. The matters involving internal controls and procedures that our management considered
to be material weaknesses under the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board were: (i) lack of a majority of independent
members and a lack of a majority of outside directors on our Board, resulting in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring
of required internal controls and procedures; and (ii) inadequate segregation of duties consistent with control objectives. Management
believes that the lack of a majority of outside directors on our Board results in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring
of required internal controls and procedures, which could result in a material misstatement in our financial statements in future periods. 

Auditor s Report on Internal Control over
Financial Reporting 

This Annual Report does not include an attestation
report of our independent registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management s report
was not subject to attestation by our independent registered public accounting firm pursuant to rules of the SEC that permit us to provide
only management s report in this Annual Report.

 Table of Contents 

Changes in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting 

In connection with our continued monitoring and maintenance
of our controls procedures as part of the implementation of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, we continue to review, test, and improve
the effectiveness of our internal controls. There have not been any changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such
term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the fourth quarter and since the year ended May 31, 2021
that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

Inherent Limitation on the Effectiveness of Internal
Controls 

The effectiveness of any system of internal control
over financial reporting is subject to inherent limitations, including the exercise of judgment in designing, implementing, operating,
and evaluating the controls and procedures, and the inability to eliminate misconduct completely. Accordingly, any system of internal
control over financial reporting can only provide reasonable, not absolute, assurances. In addition, projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. We intend to continue to monitor and upgrade our internal controls
as necessary or appropriate for our business but cannot assure that such improvements will be sufficient to provide us with effective
internal control over financial reporting.
