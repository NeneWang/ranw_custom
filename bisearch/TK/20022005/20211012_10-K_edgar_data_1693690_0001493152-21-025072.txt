Corporate
History and General Information 

Veroni
Brands Corp. Veroni or the Company was incorporated as Echo Sound Acquisition Corporation 
on December 7, 2016 under the laws of the State of Delaware. In September 2017, the Company implemented a change of control by issuing
shares to new stockholders, redeeming shares of existing stockholders, electing a new officer and director and accepting the resignations
of its then existing officers and directors. 

In
connection with the change in control, the stockholders of the Company and its board of directors unanimously approved the change of
the Company s name from Echo Sound Acquisition Corporation to European CPG Acquisition Corporation. In November 2017, the stockholders
of the Company and its board of directors unanimously approved the change of the Company s name to Veroni Brands Corp. 

The
Company is located at 2275 Half Day Road, Suite 346, Bannockburn, Illinois 60015. The Company s main phone number is 888-794-2999.
The Company s fiscal year end is December 31. Neither the Company nor its predecessors have filed for bankruptcy, receivership
or any similar proceedings nor are in the process of filing for bankruptcy, receivership or any similar proceedings. 

Summary 

The
Company is an importer, seller and distributor of premium chocolate and snack products produced in Europe, engaging with both domestic
and international well-known retailers so that its products are sold in thousands of stores in the United States. Veroni is also a supplier
of confectionery products for major U.S. retailers under private label brands. Since adopting its current business plan in late 2017,
the Company has been able to obtain and grow a distribution network, as well as contract with reliable suppliers. Veroni prides itself
on its extensive market research with premium products, superior customer service, steady relationships with suppliers and retailers,
and its success in developing private label collaborations and co-branded chocolate products. 

The
Company handles the product design and development phases in-house, while manufacturing is outsourced in Europe, with the whole cycle
being strictly supervised by the Company in order to guarantee the highest quality products. 

The
business of the Company in 2018 focused on the import, sales and distribution of premium beverage products, primarily produced in Europe.
Within this strategy, Veroni secured a long-term exclusive import and distribution agreement with a major European supplier, FoodCare
Sp. z o,o., a company organized under the laws of Poland FoodCare ). Under that agreement, FoodCare made Veroni the sole
and exclusive importer and distributor of Iron Energy in the U.S., an energy drink sponsored by celebrity boxer Mike Tyson, with access
to numerous other beverage brands through this partnership. From the summer of 2018 to the end of 2019, the Company introduced the Iron
Energy beverage to various retailers and distributors nationwide and worked with many retailers and distributors to bring the product
to market. In 2020, Veroni decided to exit the highly competitive energy drink market and focus on its chocolate and confectionery products
due to the lack of marketing support of Iron Energy by the supplier. 

In
January 2019, the Company expanded its product offerings and established a relationship with another manufacturer, Millano Group, to
import chocolate products, as well as snacks, for distribution to major retailers throughout the United States. The Company became the
vendor of record and successfully delivered these products to several well-known national and international retailers. Veroni s
current marketing strategy for its chocolate segment centers on supplying customers premium European chocolate products, in both private
label and various branded products. 

In
February 2019, the Company engaged Tyler Distribution Center, Inc. and Continental Logistics, two operating companies of Port Jersey
Logistics, to better serve its customers throughout the United States. Management believes that this partnership will give the Company
a tremendous opportunity to support its growth, as it will be able to store and ship products and fulfill its purchase orders received
from its customers. 

3 

The
Company has also established relationships with other European manufacturers that can provide a wide range of panned products,
meaning those that are coated with a sugar syrup, chocolate, or both, such as nuts, raisins, pretzels, and fruit, as well as healthy
snack items, and specialty confection goods. 

In
June 2021, the Company engaged Roadtex Transportation Corporation with 31 facilities nationwide that handles less than truckload (LTL)
logistics to better serve its customers throughout the United States. Management believes that this partnership will give the Company
a tremendous opportunity to support its growth, as it will be able to store and ship products and fulfill its purchase orders received
from its customers. 

Growth
Strategy 

The
Company plans to implement a multi-layered growth strategy, focusing on product enhancement and operational expansion. Veroni proposes
to enhance its product offering by partnering with reputable suppliers. It also plans to scale the import, sale, and distribution of
premium European chocolate and confectionery items to operate efficiently within key U.S. markets. The strategy focuses on: 

Widening
 the product portfolio by introducing a healthy snack segment comprised of items such as fruit and nut bars, and protein and grain
 bars. These products will have no GMOs, zero trans-fat, no artificial colors or flavors, and will be Halal and Kosher certified.
 The Company is approved and licensed by Rainforest Alliance to sell its chocolate products nationwide to its customers. 

Expanding
 distribution by developing further relationships with national distributors and retailers. The Company has established partnerships
 with Roadtex Transportation Corporation with 31 facilities nationwide and WCS Distribution to service its customer distribution centers
 in the Western United States. 

Attracting
 new customers by growing its network of retailers to drive direct sales. The Company plans to adopt and integrate technologies, specifically
 e-commerce and direct to consumer platforms, to facilitate customer acquisition, customer retention, and sales growth. Also, Veroni
 plans to continue to use its business development and sales professionals, as well as contract with third party brokers, to attract
 new customers, increase product sales, and spur growth. Veroni partnered with CA Fortune, a consumer brands agency, to design, build,
 and sell branded products that Veroni plans to introduce to its customers nationally. 

Maintaining
 existing customers by offering products that expand and complement its traditional product line. Veroni plans to introduce fresh
 and innovative food items to address changes in consumers tastes and preferences, as well as grow revenues on a per customer
 basis. Also, the Company plans to retain existing customers by ensuring that product quality continues to satisfy customer expectations. 

Scaling
 through mergers and acquisitions, particularly vertical integration to improve operating profit and margins. If distribution channels
 can be consolidated, operations can be streamlined and cost inefficiencies can be reduced to achieve economies of scale. Also, a
 horizontal integration strategy would allow the Company to progressively consolidate the perishable and non-perishable goods within
 its national market. 

Products 

The
Company s product mix is comprised of the following: 

CHOCOLATE 
 SNACKS 
 
 Bars 
 Muesli 
 
 Bites 
 Nuts 
 
 Truffles 
 Oatmeal 
 
 Sticks 
 Cereal
 bars 
 
 Candies 
 Dry
 fruits 
 
 Cups 
 Pretzels 
 
 Gummies 
 Cookies 

For
2020, the sale of chocolate products accounted for approximately 98 of the revenues. 

4 

Chocolate
Products. Veroni currently distributes its chocolate products under the Sweet Desire and Baron Chocolatier brands, as well as
private label chocolate bars, cups and 5bites. The Company s chocolate products are GMO free and Kosher and Halal certified, and
contain all natural ingredients with zero trans-fat, no artificial flavors or colors. The Company believes that its key competitive advantage
is that it can provide premium chocolate products at mainstream prices. 

Veroni
plans to gradually increase chocolate sales by offering products made with all natural ingredients priced at a slight discount to premium
brand chocolates offered by competitors such as Godiva, Russell Stover, Lindt, and Ghirardelli. It also plans to incrementally grow chocolate
sales by cross-merchandising chocolate products with its retail partners wine products. 

Certifications.
 The Company s distributed products are certified according to the ISO 22000 standards, and are in line with BRC and IFS
food safety requirements. ISO 22000 is a food safety management system that can be applied to any organization in the food chain. IFS
is a Global Food Safety Initiative recognized standard for certifying the safety and quality of food products and production processes.
The BRC Global Standard for Food Safety began in the U.K. to help the food industry meet legislative requirements of the European Union
General Product Safety Directive and the U.K. Food Safety Act. 

Suppliers 

On
January 30, 2018, the Company entered into a distribution agreement with FoodCare. Under the terms of the Distribution Agreement, the
Company became the exclusive importer and distributor of FoodCare s products in the United States, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin
Islands (the U.S. market ). The term of the Distribution Agreement was for a period of 10 years during which Veroni was
to have the exclusive right to distribute FoodCare products within the U.S. market, so long as Veroni purchased the required quantity
of product from FoodCare. The Distribution Agreement was terminable upon (1) mutual consent of the parties, (2) by either party in writing
without justification, if an issue was not amicably resolved in 30 days of such issue, by providing 180 days notice (in which
case the Company would lose its exclusivity rights), or (3) immediately in the event of notice of an uncured breach in the terms of the
Distribution Agreement. FoodCare is a manufacturer and supplier of desserts, cereals, energy drinks and other beverage products. Notably,
FoodCare manufactures the Iron Energy drink, a product sponsored by celebrity and former boxer Mike Tyson. Other brands
are N-Gine, 4Move, Frugo, Gellwe, and Fitella. Veroni failed to meet the minimum purchase requirements under the agreement, due in part
to FoodCare s failure to provide promised marketing support. The Company terminated the agreement and relationship with FoodCare
due to the lack of its ability to support Veroni s brand marketing initiatives. 

In
January 2019, the Company established a relationship with another manufacturer, Millano Group, a related party (controlled by the father
of a major shareholder), to import various snacks and chocolate products for distribution to major retailers throughout the United States.
For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020, Millano supplied all of the Company s product purchases. 

Operations 

Veroni
begins its product development process by generating new ideas for products. Product and packaging samples are then commissioned to the
suppliers for testing and quality assurance. When a product design is finalized and a price is confirmed with suppliers and manufacturers,
a purchase order is placed. Products are manufactured through suppliers in Europe that procure their own raw materials for finished and
packaged products. Typically, the manufacturing process takes 4 to 6 weeks. After manufacturing is completed, the Company organizes shipment
and/or storage, depending on agreements with retailers and third-party distributors. On average, the lead time from order processing
to product delivery is approximately 13 weeks. 

As
of the date of this report, the current COVID-19 crisis has resulted in the Company experiencing longer lead times in obtaining product
from its manufacturers and shipping to its customers. 

5 

At
December 31, 2020, Veroni has six employees. The Company s corporate office is located in Bannockburn, Illinois and it has arrangements
with Port Jersey Logistics, a third-party logistics company that provides warehousing, fulfillment and transportation services, and WCS
Distribution. 

Key
Markets and Market Overview 

Veroni s
primary markets include dollar stores, multi-outlets, grocery stores, convenience stores, distributors, and retailers across the U.S.,
with dollar stores accounting for approximately 50 of sales. As between sales of branded items versus private label products, private
label currently accounts for approximately 60 of sales. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company had two customers whose
sales accounted for approximately 77 of revenue. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had three customers that comprised approximately
78 or 631,575 of its combined accounts receivables and contract receivables with recourse. As of December 31, 2019, the Company had
one customer who comprised approximately 91 or 1,527,976 of its combined accounts receivables and contract receivables with recourse. 

Confectionery
Market Overview. According to IBISWorld , the revenue of the U.S. confectionery market for 2018 was 51.9 billion, and
annual revenue growth for the past five years was around 0.7 . Revenue is forecast to grow at an annualized rate of 1.0 over the next
four years to 2023. The major segments purchasing confectionery products include wholesalers, grocery stores and markets, mass merchandisers
and convenience stores. The next five years are expected to maintain a positive outlook for the U.S. confectionery industry. Continued
economic recovery will further boost consumer spending on confectionery and snacks, especially on gourmet, premium dark chocolate and
gummy candy products. 

Chocolate
Market Overview. According to Statista , chocolate and confectionery consumption in the U.S. is expected to continue its
upward trend (from 139.9 billion in 2019 to 165.2 billion by 2023), supported by population growth and rising purchasing power. Consumers
are becoming more aware of the health effects associated with consuming excessive sugar and fat. As a response to changing preferences,
low-calorie, reduced-sugar and more nutritious types of chocolate are becoming more popular. Premium, dark and organic chocolates are
key products benefitting from this trend. 

The
chocolate production industry is moderately concentrated with the top four players (Hershey, Mars, Ferrero and Lindt) accounting for
60.6 of market share in 2019, according to IBIS World . The industry has consolidated over the past five years through acquisitions.
In the past five years, industry producers have experienced stable competition from foreign chocolate producers. Although brand recognition
is important in this industry, as many brands have been in the market for decades, producers of chocolate compete based on the quality
of their products, as determined by taste, quality of ingredients and more recently, nutritional value. 

Healthy
Snacks Market Overview. According to Statista , the global healthy snacks market size is expected to grow to 32.9 billion
by 2025, with a compound annual growth rate of 5.2 during the forecast period. Increasing awareness regarding health and wellness benefits
offered by the products among consumers is likely to be a key trend driving the market. The consumption of healthy snacks is growing,
as such snacks meet various dietary requirements, such as being sugar-free and having low salt and cholesterol content. However, the
high cost of production, due to volatile prices of raw materials is expected to negatively influence the growth of the market over the
forecast period. 

Within
the food industry, the global health and wellness sector is witnessing a healthy boom that shapes the ever-growing market
as never before. Increasingly, consumers are developing food sensitivities and adopting healthier and more active lifestyles, leading
them to seek healthier nutritional alternatives and consume fresh and organic food. 

Effect
of Existing or Probable Governmental Regulation 

For
the purchase of products harvested or manufactured outside the United States, and for the shipment of products to customers located outside
the United States, the Company is subject to customs laws regarding the import and export of shipments. Its activities, including working
with customs brokers and freight forwarders, are subject to regulation by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, part of the Department
of Homeland Security. 

6 

The
FDA Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA), enacted on January 4, 2011, amended section 415 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act
(FD C Act), in relevant part, to require that facilities engaged in manufacturing, processing, packing, or holding food for consumption
in the United States submit additional registration information to FDA, including an assurance that FDA will be permitted to inspect
the facility at the times and in the manner permitted by the FD C Act. Section 415 of the FD C Act, as amended by FSMA, also
requires food facilities required to register with FDA to renew such registrations every other year, and provides FDA with authority
to suspend the registration of a food facility in certain circumstances. Specifically, if FDA determines that food manufactured, processed,
packed, received, or held by a registered food facility has a reasonable probability of causing serious adverse health consequences or
death to humans or animals, FDA may by order suspend the registration of a facility that: 

Created,
 caused, or was otherwise responsible for such reasonable probability; or 

Knew
 of, or had reason to know of, such reasonable probability; and packed, received, or held such food. 

The
Company s operations may be subject to these registration requirements. Compliance with these regulations has not had a material
impact on the Company s earnings, expenditures, or competitive positioning. 

Intellectual
Property 

At
present, the Company has a pending trademark application for its new brand, This and That chocolate. The Company may decide
in the future to pursue efforts to protect its other intellectual property, trade secrets and proprietary methods and processes. 

Research

The
Company has not to date undertaken, and does not currently plan to undertake, any material research and development activities.

 Proceedings. 

On
June 17, 2019, The Scale Effect Company d/b/a Mant Logistics filed an amended complaint in the United States District Court for the Northern
District of Illinois naming as defendants the Company, Igor Gabal, Tomasz Kotas, and Baron Chocolatier, Inc. The action was originally
against Baron Chocolatier only, alleging that Baron did not pay for shipping and logistics services in the amount of 277,233, plus accrued
interest. The complaint was amended to allege that the Company is a successor corporation and continuation of Baron Chocolatier, thereby
making the Company liable for the debts and liabilities of Baron, and that Baron is an alter ego for the Company, Igor Gabal and Tomasz
Kotas. No trial date has been scheduled. The parties are still in the discovery stage. The Company intends to vigorously defend in this
lawsuit.

judgment entered in this case has been vacated and the Company intends to defend in this lawsuit.

 Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 

Overview 

Veroni
Brands Corp. (formerly Echo Sound Acquisition Corporation ( Veroni or the Company was incorporated
on December 7, 2016, under the laws of the state of Delaware. The business purpose of the Company is to facilitate the sales and distribution
of premium food products from Europe. 

Prior
to 2018, the Company s operations were limited to issuing shares to its original stockholders and effecting a change in control
of the Company. In 2018, the Company commenced its principal operations. The Company originated as a blank check company and qualifies
as an emerging growth company as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act which became law in April 2012. 

On
January 30, 2018, the Company entered into a distribution agreement with FoodCare. Under the terms of the Distribution Agreement, the
Company became the exclusive importer and distributor of FoodCare s products in the United States, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin
Islands (the U.S. market ). FoodCare is a manufacturer and supplier of desserts, cereals, energy drinks and other beverage
products. Notably, FoodCare manufactures the Iron Energy drink, a product sponsored by celebrity and former boxer Mike
Tyson. The term of the Distribution Agreement was for a period of 10 years during which Veroni was to have the exclusive right to distribute
FoodCare products within the U.S. market, so long as Veroni purchased the required quantity of product from FoodCare. The Company failed
to meet its minimum purchase requirements under the FoodCare agreement in 2018 in part due to FoodCare s failure to provide promised
marketing support. The Company terminated the agreement and relationship with FoodCare in 2020 due to the lack of its ability to support
Veroni s brand marketing initiatives. 

In
summer 2018, the Company introduced the Iron Energy beverage to various retailers and distributors nationwide and since then has been
working with many retailers and distributors to bring the product to market. 

In
January 2019, the Company expanded its product offerings and established a relationship with another manufacturer, Millano Group, a related
party, to import chocolate products, as well as snacks, for distribution to major retailers throughout the United States. The Company
recently became the vendor of record and successfully delivered these products to several national retailers. 

In
February 2019, the Company engaged Tyler Distribution and Continental Logistics, two operating companies of Port Jersey Logistics, to
better serve its customers throughout the United States. Management believes that this partnership will give the Company a tremendous
opportunity to support its growth, as it will be able to store and ship products and fulfill its purchase orders received from its customers. 

In
June 2021, the Company engaged Roadtex Transportation Corporation with 31 facilities nationwide that handles LTL logistics to better
serve its customers throughout the United States. Management believes that this partnership will give the Company a tremendous opportunity
to support its growth, as it will be able to store and ship products and fulfill its purchase orders received from its customers. 

The
Company has also established relationships with other European manufacturers that can provide a wide range of panned products,
meaning those that are coated with a sugar syrup, chocolate, or both, such as nuts, raisins, pretzels, and fruit, as well as healthy
snack items, and specialty confection goods. 

For
the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020, the Company s independent auditors issued a report raising substantial doubt about the
Company s ability to continue as a going concern. For the year ending December 31, 2020, the Company has an accumulated deficit
of 1,386,108 since its inception. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had a cash balance available of approximately 116,730 and a
working capital deficit of 342,796, which is not sufficient to meet its operating requirements for the next twelve months. Therefore,
the Company s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on its ability to grow its revenue and generate sufficient cash
flows from operations to meet its obligations and/or obtaining additional financing from its shareholders or other sources, as may be
required. The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern; however,
the above condition raises substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern.

Results
of Operations 

Prior
to 2018, the Company had focused its efforts on identifying business opportunities, and devoted little attention or resources to sales
and marketing or generating near-term revenues and profits. During 2018, the Company began distribution of various products and then
increased its distribution network during 2019. During 2020, the Company s revenues were impacted by the effects of COVID-19 as
the pandemic affected transportation logistics. Revenues were 5,581,764 for 2020, as compared to 6,678,790 for 2019. 

The
2020 gross profit of 1,155,331 was not sufficient to cover the Company s operating expenses of 1,534,439, consisting of 359,399
in warehouse and selling expenses and 1,175,040 in general and administrative expenses, resulting in a net loss from operations of 379,108.
In comparison, a gross profit of 860,352 was generated in 2019. Due to operating expenses of 1,419,806, consisting of 646,249 in warehouse
and selling expenses and 773,557 in general and administrative expenses, a net loss from operations of 559,454 resulted. 

The
increase in general and administrative expenses from 773,557 in 2019 to 1,175,040 in 2020 was due primarily to an increase in officers 
salaries from 62,500 in 2019 to 552,656 in 2020. 

The
Company incurred no interest expense in 2020, as compared to 141,359 of interest expense on various promissory notes in 2019, resulting
in a net loss of 700,813. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

At
December 31, 2020, the Company had cash and a working capital deficit of 116,730 and 342,796, respectively, as compared to 99,010
and 364,784, respectively, at December 31, 2019. During the year ended December 31, 2020, operating activities provided cash of 573,978,
and financing activities used cash of 556,258. In comparison, during fiscal 2019, operating activities used cash of 1,599,780 with
 1,695,791 being provided by financing activities. 

Under
the Small Business Administration SBA ), the Company applied for the Paycheck Protection Program PPP loan.
These loans are forgiven if used for payroll, payroll benefits, including health insurance and retirement plans, as well as certain rent
payments, leases, and utility payments, which are limited to 40 of the loan proceeds, all of which if paid within either 8 weeks or
24 weeks of the receipt of the loan proceeds. At the time of this filing, we anticipate a significant amount of this loan will be forgiven;
however, the forgiveness application process is not yet complete. The Company has elected to record these advances under the debt treatment
for these loans, under GAAP guidance. Unforgiven portions of these loans will be repaid over 5 years, accruing interest at 1 per annum.
The PPP loan has a loan balance of 56,250 as December 31, 2020. 

On
August 27, 2020, the Company executed the standard loan documents required for securing a loan (the EIDL Loan from the
SBA under its Economic Injury Disaster Loan EIDL assistance program in light of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on
the Company s business. Pursuant to that certain Loan Authorization and Agreement (the SBA Loan Agreement ), the principal
amount of the EIDL Loan is up to 150,000, with proceeds to be used for working capital purposes. On September 2, 2020, the Company received
 149,900. Interest accrues at the rate of 3.75 per annum. Installment payments, including principal and interest, are due monthly beginning
August 27, 2021 (twelve months from the date of the SBA Note (defined below)) in the amount of 720. The balance of principal and interest
is payable thirty years from the date of the SBA Note. 

In
connection therewith, the Company executed (i) a note for the benefit of the SBA (the SBA Note ), which contains customary
events of default and (ii) a Security Agreement, granting the SBA a security interest in all tangible and intangible personal property
of the Company, which also contains customary events of default (the SBA Security Agreement ). 

The
Company s proposed activities will necessitate significant uses of capital into and beyond 2021, particularly for the financing
of inventory. While the Company has a factoring arrangement, sales of equity securities in the Company would result in reduced financing
costs. Since the beginning of 2018 and through December 31, 2020, the Company has engaged in sales of its equity securities in private
placements. Through December 31, 2020, 10,531,400 shares have been sold for total gross proceeds of 518,533, 29,997 shares have been
issued for services rendered valued at 22,497, 186,965 shares valued at 140,223 have been issued in lieu of interest, 286,667 shares
have been issued upon conversion of a 215,000 promissory note, and a total of 2,270,000 shares were redeemed for 45,200.

Plan
of Operations 

During
2019 and 2020, sales were concentrated in two customers. One of these customers notified the Company that it was not selected as a vendor
for 2021. Sales in 2021 are expected to decrease by more than 50 . As vendor selection is an annual process with this customer, the Company
is planning to reapply as a vendor for 2022 and broaden its customer base. For the next few years, the Company will continue to focus
on obtaining visibility for the products by contacting convenience store locations and small distributors to those types of locations.
In addition, the Company will also continue to expand the number of products to be imported from Europe and distributed throughout the
United States. 

Management
believes that while the current COVID-19 crisis has not affected the volume of sales, it has resulted in the Company experiencing supply
chain and transportation logistics issues. Manufacturers and those providing shipping and logistics services are increasing prices and/or
decreasing the amount of product and/or services to the Company, thereby making it more difficult to meet the terms of contracts with
retailers. Management believes that for the current fiscal year, the Company will experience reduced profit margins as a result. It is
not known whether the supply chain and transportation logistics issues will continue into the future. 

There
is no assurance that the Company s activities will generate sufficient revenues to sustain its operations without additional capital,
or if additional capital is needed, that such funds, if available, will be obtainable on terms satisfactory to the Company. Accordingly,
given the Company s limited cash and cash equivalents on hand, the Company will be unable to implement its business plans and proposed
operations unless it obtains additional financing or otherwise is able to generate revenues and profits. In 2019, the Company entered
into a factoring agreement covering its accounts receivable (see below). The Company may raise additional capital through sales of debt
or equity, obtain loan financing or develop and consummate other alternative financial plans. In the near term, the Company plans to
rely on its primary stockholders to continue to fund the Company s continuing operating requirements. The Company will require
a minimum of 600,000 for the next 12 months to fund its operations, which will be used to fund expenses related to operations, office
supplies, travel, salaries and other incidental expenses. Management believes that this capital would allow the Company to meet its operating
cash requirements, and would facilitate the Company s business of selling and distributing its products. Management also believes
that the acquisition of such assets would generate revenue to cover overhead cost and general liabilities of the Company, and allow the
Company to achieve overall sustainable profitability. 

Due
to the above-described difficulties, management is seeking other opportunities outside of the import/distribution business in order to
bring value to the stockholders. 

Accounts
Receivable Financing 

On
February 21, 2019, the Company entered into a factoring agreement with an unrelated third party, Advance Business Capital LLC, dba Interstate
Capital ICC ), pursuant to which the Company sells the majority of its accounts receivable to ICC for 85 of the value
of the receivable. The term of the agreement is for 12 months and automatically renews for additional 12-month periods. The accounts
receivable are sold with recourse back to the Company, meaning that the Company bears the risk of non-payment by the account debtor.
To secure its obligations to ICC, the Company has granted a blanket security interest in its other assets, such as inventory, equipment,
machinery, furniture, fixtures, contract rights, and general intangibles. The loan is guaranteed by two major shareholders of the Company.
On September 11, 2019, the lender (which now does business as Triumph Business Capital) entered into an amended agreement with the Company
which lowered the interest charged by the lender from 0.49 for every 10 days to prime rate (with a floor of 5.5 plus 3 . As of December
31, 2020 and 2019, the Company owed 649,502 and 1,414,639, respectively, for advances on is receivables.

Alternative
Financial Planning 

The
Company has no alternative financial plans at the moment. If the Company is not able to successfully raise monies as needed through a
private placement or other securities offering (including, but not limited to, a primary public offering of securities), the Company s
ability to survive as a going concern and implement any part of its business plan or strategy will be severely jeopardized. 

Critical
Accounting Policies 

The
financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
The preparation of these financial statements requires making estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities,
revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. The estimates are based on historical experience
and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making
judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ
from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements 

The
Company has no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on its financial
condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.

REPORT
OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

 Veroni
Brands Corp. 

Opinion
on the Financial Statements 

We
have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Veroni Brands Corp. (the Company) as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the related statements
of operations, changes in stockholders equity (deficit), and cash flows for the years then ended, and the related notes (collectively
referred to as the financial statements ). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects,
the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the
years then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 

Going
Concern 

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 1 to
the financial statements, the Company has an accumulated deficit since inception and insufficient working capital to meet its operating
requirements, which raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management s plans regarding these
matters are also described in Note 1. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this
uncertainty. 

Restatement
of the 2019 Financial Statements 

As
discussed in Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements, the accompanying 2019 financial statements have been restated to correct
a misstatement. 

Basis
for Opinion 

These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s
financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities
laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB . 

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company
is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits,
we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion
on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our
audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error
or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and the significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe our audits provide
a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

F- 1 

Critical
Audit Matter 

The
critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated
or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial
statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters
does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit
matter below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. 

Stock-Based
Compensation 

As
discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, the Company issues stock-based compensation to non-employees. 

Auditing
management s calculation of the fair value of stock-based compensation can be a significant judgment given the fact that the Company
uses management s estimates on various inputs to the calculation. 

To
evaluate the appropriateness of the fair value determined by management, we examined and evaluated the inputs management used in calculating
the fair value of the stock-based compensation.

Note
1 - Nature of Operations and Financial Condition 

Veroni
Brands Corp. (the Company was incorporated on December 7, 2016 under the laws of the state of Delaware to engage in any
lawful corporate undertaking, including, but not limited to, selected mergers and acquisition. 

The
Company has been formed to acquire, operate, develop, grow and import premium European products into the U.S. market. Veroni Brands was
created to search out desirable premium products across Europe and make them accessible to discerning consumers in the U.S. Veroni Brands
strives to import the extraordinary and delight its consumers with experiences that had previously only been attainable in Europe. In
January 2018, the Company became an exclusive importer and distributor of Iron Energy by Mike Tyson. The beverage became
available to consumers in select Chicago area markets in May 2018 in three different flavors such as Mojito, Zero
Sugar and Original. During 2019, the Company built the distribution of the Iron Energy product nationwide. Beginning
in February 2019, the Company expanded its import and distribution network with the distribution of chocolate products and significantly
grew its sales and distribution volumes. The Company entered into long term supply agreements with major U.S national retailers to import
chocolate products under Private Label Brands that are currently being sold in over 20,000 retail locations across the
U.S. The Company takes pride in the variety of consumer products it imports and is proud to share them with its consumers nationwide.
The Company s recent expansion of the import and distribution of snacks, chocolate and chocolate related products that are currently
being sold to U.S. national retailers presents the Company with a substantial growth opportunity to introduce to its retail partners
to many other consumer products and to increase its network of retailers. 

Going
Concern 

The
Company has generated revenue this year of approximately 5.6 million and incurred a net loss of 379,108 for the year ending December
31, 2020 and has an accumulated deficit of 1,386,108 since its inception. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had a cash balance available
of approximately 116,730 and working capital of 342,796) which is not sufficient to meet its operating requirements for the next twelve
months. Therefore, the Company s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on its ability to grow its revenue and generate
sufficient cash flows from operations to meet its obligations and/or obtaining additional financing from its shareholders or other sources,
as may be required. 

The
Company failed to meet its minimum annual purchase requirements under the FoodCare Sp. z.o.o. FoodCare agreement, in
part due to FoodCare s failure to provide promised marketing support. In 2020, the Company terminated the agreement and relationship
with FoodCare and no longer had exclusive rights to distribute FoodCare s Iron Energy drinks. The Company has found greater success
with the distribution of chocolate and snack products instead of beverages. In addition to importing products from ZWC Millano, the Company
has recently established relationships with other European manufacturers that can manufacture wide range of panned products,
meaning those that are coated with a sugar syrup and/or chocolate, such as nuts, raisin, pretzels, fruits and many other panned 
and healthy snacks items as well as chocolate bars, multi-flavor truffles, sticks, chocolate cups, 5-bites, chocolate covered gummies,
chocolate Easter eggs, custom Christmas chocolate figures as well as Advent calendars and many other products to support demand of the
Company s national retailers. 

The
Company is continuing to evaluate various financing options in order to continue the funding of the expansion of its operations, the
products being offered and its customer base. The Company is also focusing on broadening its customer base. As disclosed below in Accounts
Receivable and Concentration of Credit Risk , a significant customer did not select the Company as a vendor for 2021. 

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern; however, the above condition
raises substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any
adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classifications
of liabilities that may result should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.

2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 

Reclassifications 

Certain
reclassifications have been made in the 2019 financial statements to conform to the 2020 presentation. These reclassifications have no
effect on net loss for 2019. 

Advertising 

The
Company s policy is to expense advertising costs as incurred. Advertising expense for the year ending December 31, 2020 and 2019
is 30,935 and 50,117, respectively. 

Use
of Estimates 

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the
reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include
the carrying amount of inventory and associated reserves, and allowances and reserves in regards to receivables and revenue. Actual results
could differ from those estimates. 

Revenue
Recognition 

The
Company s significant accounting policy for revenue was updated as a result of the adoption of ASU Topic 606. The Company has adopted
the new standard on January 1, 2019 and has used the modified retrospective method. The majority of the Company s business is ship
and bill. Based on our analysis, the Company did not identify a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings at December 31, 2018.
The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with the five-step model as prescribed by ASU 606 in which the Company evaluates the transfer
of promised goods or services and recognizes revenue when its customer obtains control of promised goods or services in an amount that
reflects the consideration which the Company expects to be entitled to receive in exchange for those goods or services. To determine
revenue recognition for the arrangements that the Company determines are within the scope of ASU 606, the Company performs the following
five steps: (1) identify the contract(s) with a customer, (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract, (3) determine the
transaction price, (4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract and (5) recognize revenue when (or
as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. See Note 12 for revenue disaggregated by product line. 

The
Company recognizes revenue from the sale of products when title and risk of loss passes and the customer accepts the goods, which generally
occurs at the time of delivery to a customer warehouse. Customer sales incentives such as volume-based rebates or discounts are treated
as a reduction of sales at the time the sale is recognized. Shipping and handling costs are treated as fulfillment costs and presented
in warehouse and selling expenses. 

Payments
that are received before performance obligations are recorded are shown as current liabilities. 

Cash
and Cash Equivalents 

Cash
and cash equivalents include cash on hand and on deposit at banking institutions as well as all highly liquid short-term investments
with original maturities of 90 days or less. 

Shipping
Costs 

Costs
associated with shipping product to customers aggregating approximately 206,052 and 201,561 for the years ended December 31, 2020 and
2019, respectively, is included in warehouse and selling expenses.

Concentration
of Risk 

Financial
instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash. The Company places its
cash with high quality banking institutions. The Company did not have cash balances in excess of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation
limit as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. 

Accounts
Receivable and Concentration of Credit Risk 

Accounts
receivable are recorded at the invoiced amounts less an allowance for doubtful accounts. The allowance for doubtful accounts is based
on the Company s estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in its accounts receivable. The Company determines the allowance
for doubtful accounts based upon an aging of accounts receivable, historical experience and management judgment. Accounts receivable
balances are periodically reviewed for collectability, and balances are charged off against the allowance when the Company determines
that the potential for recovery is remote. An allowance for doubtful accounts of approximately -0- and 2,125 is reserved as of December
31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. 

We
are exposed to credit risk in the normal course of business, primarily related to accounts receivable. To limit credit risk, management
periodically reviews and evaluates the financial condition of its customers and maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts. For the
year ended December 31, 2020, we had one customer who comprised approximately 57 or 617,272 of our contract receivables with recourse
and two customers who comprised approximately 100 or 14,303 of our accounts receivable. For the year ended December 31, 2019, we had
one customer who comprised approximately 86 or 1,453,432 of our contract receivables with recourse and one customer who comprised approximately
57 or 74,544 of our accounts receivable. 

For
the year ended December 31, 2020, we had two customers with sales in excess of 10 of our revenue and they represented 77 of our revenue.
For the year ended December 31, 2019, we had two customers with sales in excess of 10 of our revenue and they represented 72 of our
revenue. 

One
of these customers had sales of approximately 2,405,000 and 3,887,000 in 2020 and 2019, respectively. Per Note 15, the Company was
not selected as a vendor for 2021 for this customer. 

Distribution
Agreements and Supplier Concentration 

In
January 2018, the Company entered into a distributor agreement with FoodCare, which was amended and restated on January 30, 2018. FoodCare
is a company organized under the laws of Poland. FoodCare is a manufacturer and supplier of desserts, cereals, energy drinks and other
beverage products. FoodCare manufactures the Iron Energy drink, a product sponsored by celebrity Mike Tyson. 

Under
the terms of the distribution agreement, the Company became the exclusive distributor of FoodCare products in the United States, Puerto
Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. FoodCare is the sole supplier of Iron Energy to the Company. The term of the agreement was for ten
years and gave the Company exclusive rights to distribute FoodCare products within the U.S. market, so long as the Company purchased
the required quantity of product from FoodCare. 

The
Company failed to meet its minimum purchases in 2018, due in part to FoodCare s failure to provide marketing support as promised.
The Company terminated the agreement and relationship with FoodCare in 2020. Sales of Iron Energy were only 33,475 in 2020. The termination
of the Iron Energy drink distribution agreement did not significantly affect the company or its revenue, as the Company
has found greater success with the distribution of chocolate and snack products instead of beverages. 

At
the beginning of 2019, the Company established relationships with other European manufacturers that can manufacture a wide range of panned 
products such as nuts, raisin, pretzels, fruits and many other panned and healthy snacks items, as well as chocolate bars,
multi-flavor truffles, sticks, chocolate cups, 5-bites, chocolate covered gummies, chocolate Easter eggs, custom Christmas chocolate
figures as well as Advent calendars and many other products to support demand from the Company s national retailers.

Vendor
Concentration 

Currently,
the Company is sourcing all its chocolate products and snacks from the Millano Group, a related party. The Company has not entered into
a distributor agreement but is currently negotiating an agreement with Millano Group. The Company, due to relationships with other European
manufacturers could find other sources to replace its chocolate and snack products if the Company were to terminate Millano Group as
its suppler for chocolate products. Total purchases in 2020 and 2019 were approximately 3,961,711 and 5,102,224, respectively which
represents 100 and 99 of product purchases, respectively. 

Income
Taxes 

Under
ASC 740, Income Taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to
temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax
bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in
which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Valuation allowances are established when it is more
likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, there were no
net deferred tax assets, as the Company established a 100 valuation allowance, due to the uncertainty of the realization of net
operating loss carryforwards prior to their expiration. 

Loss
Per Common Share 

Basic
loss per common share excludes dilution and is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding
during the period. Diluted loss per common share reflect the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to
issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock or resulted in the issuance of common stock that then shared in the
loss of the entity. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, there are no outstanding dilutive securities. 

Fair
Value of Financial Instruments 

The
Company follows guidance for accounting for fair value measurements of financial assets and financial liabilities and for fair value
measurements of nonfinancial items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis. Additionally,
the Company adopted guidance for fair value measurement related to nonfinancial items that are recognized and disclosed at fair value
in the financial statements on a nonrecurring basis. The guidance establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation
techniques used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical
assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to measurements involving significant unobservable inputs (Level
3 measurements). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows: 

Level
1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access
at the measurement date. 

Level
2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly
or indirectly. 

Level
3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability. The carrying amounts of financial assets such as cash approximate their
fair values because of the short maturity of these instruments. 

The
carrying amounts of the Company s financial instruments, which include cash and cash equivalents and accounts payable approximate
their fair values at December 31, 2020 and 2019 due to their short-term nature and management s belief that their carrying amounts
approximate the amount for which the assets could be sold or the liabilities could be settled.

Share-Based
Compensation 

The
Company accounts for stock-based compensation issued to non-employees and consultants in accordance with the provisions of ASC 505-50,
 Equity Based Payments to Non-Employees . Measurement of share-based payment transactions with non-employees is based on the
fair value of whichever is more reliably measurable: (a) the goods or services received; or (b) the equity instruments issued. The fair
value of the share-based payment transaction is determined at the earlier of performance commitment date or performance completion date.
In June 2018, the Financial Accounting Standards Board adopted Accounting Standards Update 2018-07 Compensation Stock 

Compensation
(Topic 718): Improvements to Nonemployee Share-Based Payment Accounting. In that update, ASC 505 has been rescinded in its entirety and
share based compensation issued to nonemployees will now fall under ASC 718 and its associated fair value measurements. Due to the Emerging
Growth Company (see below) status of the Company, the Company has adopted the update on January 1, 2020. 

Emerging
Growth Company 

The
Company has elected to be an emerging growth company as defined under the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 Jobs Act ).
Included with this election, the Company has also elected to use the provisions within the Jobs Act that allow companies that go public
to continue to use the private company adoption date rules for new accounting policies. Should the Company obtain revenues in excess
of 1 billion on an annual basis, have its non-affiliated market capitalization increase to over 700 million as of the last day of its
second quarter, or raise in excess of 1 billion in public offerings of its equity or instruments directly convertible into its equity,
it will forfeit its status under the Jobs Act as an emerging growth company. 

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements 

In
February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). The guidance in ASU 2016-02 provides guidance in GAAP about the
recognition of assets and liabilities by lessees for those leases classified as operating leases under GAAP. The guidance requires that
a lessee should recognize in the statement of financial position a liability to make lease payments and a right-to-use asset representing
the company s right to use the underlying assets for the term of the lease. The guidance allows a lessee who enter into a lease
with a term of 12 months or less to make an accounting policy election to not recognize assets and liabilities. 

In
January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill
Impairment. The update simplifies the measurement of goodwill by eliminating Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test. The annual
or interim goodwill impairment test is performed by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. An impairment
charge should be recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit s fair value. The update also
eliminates the requirements for any reporting unit with a zero or negative carrying amount to perform a qualitative assessment and, if
it fails that qualitative test, to perform Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test. An entity still has the option to perform the qualitative
assessment for a reporting unit to determine if the quantitative impairment test is necessary. The update should be applied on a prospective
basis. The provisions of ASU 2017-04 are effective for the fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption is permitted.
The Company has elected this accounting guidance as of January 1, 2020. It has had no effect on the Company s financial statements. 

On
June 20, 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-07, which simplifies the accounting for share based payments granted to nonemployees for goods
and services. Under the ASU, most of the guidance on such payments to nonemployees would be aligned with the requirements for share-based
payments granted to employees. For emerging growth companies, the amendments in ASU 2018-07 are effective for fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 2018. The Company is in the process of reviewing the potential impact of ASU 2018-07.

10 Income Taxes 

The
Company follows the guidance of FASB ASC 740-10 which relates to the Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes , which seeks to
reduce the diversity in practice associated with the accounting and reporting for uncertainty in income tax positions. This interpretation
prescribes a comprehensive model for financial statement recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of uncertain tax positions
taken or expected to be taken in income tax returns.

Deferred
income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial
reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. The following is a reconciliation of the expected statutory federal
income tax provision (21 percent) to the actual income tax benefit for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:

Under
ASC 740, Income Taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences
between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets
and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences
are expected to be recovered or settled. Valuation allowances are established when it is more likely than not that some or all of the
deferred tax assets will not be realized. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, there were no deferred taxes due to the uncertainty of the
realization of net operating loss or carry forward prior to expiration.

On
June 17, 2019, The Scale Effect Company d/b/a Mant Logistics filed an amended complaint in the United States District Court for the Northern
District of Illinois naming as defendants the Company, Baron Chocolatier, Inc. and two significant shareholders of the Company. The action
was originally against Baron Chocolatier only, alleging that Baron did not pay for shipping and logistics services in the amount of 277,233,
plus accrued interest. The complaint was amended to allege that the Company is a successor corporation and continuation of Baron Chocolatier,
thereby making the Company liable for the debts and liabilities of Baron, and that Baron is an alter ego for the Company and the Company s
two significant shareholders. No trial date has been scheduled. The parties are still in the discovery stage, as the pandemic and a reassignment
of the case to a new judge caused delays. The Company intends to vigorously defend in this lawsuit.

In
February 2021, the Company entered into a consulting agreement with a firm to provide strategic business planning services for a period
of six months in consideration for the issuance of 27,000 restricted shares of common stock. 

In
April 2021, the Company received a letter from one of its significant customers stating that the Company was not selected as a vendor
for 2021. 

In
June 2021, the Company entered into storage and procurement distribution agreement with a transportation company to store the chocolate
products, as well as fulfill the purchase orders from the Company s customers. The agreement is for a term of two years from the
date of first inbound receipt and may be terminated at the option of the Company upon 60 days notice.

Item
 9. 
 Changes
 in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure. 

On
January 18, 2021, the Company dismissed L J Soldinger Associates, LLC Soldinger as its independent registered public
accounting firm. Other than as noted in the paragraph below, the report of Soldinger on the Company s financial statements for
the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 did not contain an adverse opinion or disclaimer of opinion, and such reports were not qualified
or modified as to audit scope, or accounting principles. 

The
report of Soldinger on the Company s financial statements as of and for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 contained explanatory
paragraphs which noted that there was substantial doubt as to the Company s ability to continue as a going concern as the Company
had recurring losses from operations, and an accumulated deficit, low working capital and cash balances that raised substantial doubt
about its ability to continue as a going concern. 

During
the fiscal years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 and through the interim period ended January 18, 2021, there were no disagreements 
(as such term is defined in Item 304 of Regulation S-K) with Soldinger on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial
statement disclosure or auditing scope or procedure, which disagreements, if not resolved to Soldinger s satisfaction, would have
caused it to make reference thereto in its reports on the Company s financial statements for such periods. 

On
January 20, 2021, the Company engaged M K CPA, PLLC M K as the registered independent public accountant for the
fiscal year ended December 31, 2020. The decision to appoint M K was approved by the Company s Board of Directors on January
20, 2021. 

During
the Company s two most recent fiscal years and the subsequent interim period up through the date of engagement of M K (January
20, 2021), neither the Company nor anyone on its behalf consulted M K regarding the application of accounting principles to a specific
completed or contemplated transaction, or the type of audit opinion that might be rendered on the Company s financial statements.
Further, M K has not provided the Company with written or oral advice that was an important factor that the Company considered in
reaching a decision as to any accounting, auditing or financial reporting issues. 

Item

 Controls
 and Procedures. 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures and Changes in Internal Controls 

We
maintain disclosure controls and procedures designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our
reports filed pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), is recorded, processed, summarized
and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms, and that such information
is accumulated and communicated to our management, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. A control
system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance the objectives of the control
system are met. 

As
of December 31, 2020, our management carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as such
term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act. Based on this evaluation, the President and Chief Financial Officer
concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of December 31, 2020, because of the identification
of the material weakness in internal control over financial reporting described below. Notwithstanding the material weakness that existed
as of December 31, 2020, our President and Chief Financial Officer has concluded that the financial statements included in this Annual
Report on Form 10-K present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position, results of operations and cash flows of the Company
and its subsidiaries in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America GAAP ).

Management s
Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over
financial reporting is a set of processes designed by, or under the supervision of, a company s principal executive and principal
financial officers, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP and includes those policies and procedures that: 

Pertain
 to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect our transactions and dispositions of our assets; 

Provide
 reasonable assurance our transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of our financial statements in accordance with
 GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and 

Provide
 reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that
 could have a material effect on the financial statements. 

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. It should be noted that
any system of internal control, however well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, and not absolute, assurance that the
objectives of the system will be met. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk
that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures
may deteriorate. 

Under
the supervision and with the participation of our management, we conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control
over financial reporting based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee
of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in 1992, as of December 31, 2020. 

As
a result of our material weakness described below, management has concluded that, as of December 31, 2019, our internal control over
financial reporting was not effective based on the criteria in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by COSO. 

Material
Weakness in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

A
material weakness is a deficiency or combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable
possibility, that a material misstatement of the Company s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected
on a timely basis. In connection with its assessment, management identified the following material weaknesses at December 31, 2020: 

There
 is a lack of segregation of duties within the accounting and financial reporting process along with the proper safeguards to prevent
 the management override of controls, as the Company has only one executive officer. 

Since
 we use external consultants to prepare our financial statements and provide sufficient documentation of such preparation and review
 procedures, our officer must rely on such documentation. 

We
 had only one executive officer at December 31, 2020. 

Due
to our limited resources, we expect these weaknesses in internal control to continue while we implement our business plan. 

This
Annual Report does not include an attestation report of our independent registered public accounting firm regarding internal control
over financial reporting. Management s report was not subject to attestation by our independent registered public accounting firm
pursuant to the rules of the SEC that permit us to provide only management s report in this annual report. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

During
the period covered by this annual report, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that have materially
affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

The

 Igor
 Gabal 
 
 President,
 Secretary, Chief Financial Officer Director 
 
 2017 

Igor
Gabal, age 46, serves as President, Secretary, Chief Financial Officer and Director of the Company. Mr. Gabal has over 15 years of middle-market
private equity investment experience primarily in real estate, industrial manufacturing, consumer packaged goods distribution or services
operating industries. He has initiated and overseen add-on acquisitions, debt capital market issues for various companies and has experience
and relationships with middle-market private equity firms, investment banks and debt financing sources. Prior to founding Veroni Brands,
Corp. Mr. Gabal served as a board member and managing member for Guterman Partners Companies since 2009. Mr. Gabal was acting as EVP
for Baron Chocolatier, Inc. the company that has specialized on the import and distribution of chocolate related products throughout
the United States since 2016. Mr. Gabal received his Bachelor of Science in Business Management degree from DeVry Institute in 2000 and
also attended Kellogg School of Management 2000-2002. 

Committees
and Terms 

The
Board of Directors has not established any committees. Our entire Board of Directors, rather than committees, acts on various items.
The Board of Directors has determined that it does not have an audit committee financial expert. 

A
stockholder who wishes to communicate with our Board of Directors may do so by directing a written request addressed to our President
and Director, at the address appearing on the first page of this filing. 

Code
of Ethics 

Our
Board of Directors has not adopted a code of ethics. We anticipate that we will adopt a code of ethics when we increase either the number
of our Directors or the number of our employees. 

Nominees
to the Board of Directors 

Since
our last proxy statement, we have not made any material changes to the procedures by which stockholders may recommend nominees to our
board of directors. Our Company does not have any defined policy or procedural requirements for stockholders to submit recommendations
or nominations for Directors. The Board of Directors believes that, given the stage of our development, a specific nominating policy
would be premature and of little assistance until our business operations develop to a more advanced level. Our Company does not currently
have any specific or minimum criteria for the election of nominees to the Board of Directors and we do not have any specific process
or procedure for evaluating such nominees. The Board of Directors will assess all candidates, whether submitted by management or stockholders,
and make recommendations for election or appointment.

Section
16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance 

Section
16(a) of the Exchange Act requires our officers, directors, and persons who beneficially own more than 10 of our common stock to file
reports of securities ownership and changes in such ownership with the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC ). Officers,
directors and greater than 10 beneficial owners are also required by rules promulgated by the SEC to furnish us with copies of all Section
16(a) forms they file. 

Based
solely upon a review of the copies of such forms furnished to us, or written representations that no Form 5 filings were required, we
believe that during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020, there were no instances where officers, directors, or greater than 10 beneficial
owners did not comply with Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act. 

Risk
Oversight 

Effective
risk oversight is an important priority of the Board of Directors. Because risks are considered in virtually every business decision,
the Board of Directors discusses risk throughout the year generally or in connection with specific proposed actions. The Board of Directors 
approach to risk oversight includes understanding the critical risks in the Company s business and strategy, evaluating the Company s
risk management processes, allocating responsibilities for risk oversight among the full Board of Directors, and fostering an appropriate
culture of integrity and compliance with legal responsibilities. 

Corporate
Governance 

The
Company promotes accountability for adherence to honest and ethical conduct; endeavors to provide full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable
disclosure in reports and documents that the Company files with the Securities and Exchange Commission and in other public communications
made by the Company; and strives to be compliant with applicable governmental laws, rules and regulations. The Company has not formally
adopted a written code of business conduct and ethics that governs the Company s employees, officers and Directors as the Company
is not required to do so. 

In
lieu of an Audit Committee, the Company s Board of Directors is responsible for reviewing and making recommendations concerning
the selection of outside auditors, reviewing the scope, results and effectiveness of the annual audit of the Company s financial
statements and other services provided by the Company s independent public accountants. The Board of Directors reviews the Company s
internal accounting controls, practices and policies.

The
compensation discussed herein addresses all compensation awarded to, earned by, or paid to our named executive officers. There are no

Outstanding
Equity Awards at Fiscal Year-End 

There
are no current outstanding equity awards to our executive officers as of December 31, 2020. 

Executive
Compensation Philosophy 

Our
Board of Directors determines the compensation given to our executive officers in its sole determination. Our Board of Directors also
reserves the right to pay our executives a salary, and/or issue them shares of common stock issued in consideration for services rendered
and/or to award incentive bonuses which are linked to our performance, as well as to the individual executive officer s performance.
This package may also include long-term stock-based compensation to certain executives, which is intended to align the performance of
our executives with our long-term business strategies. Additionally, the Board of Directors reserves the right to grant stock options
in the future, if the Board in its sole determination believes such grants would be in the best interests of the Company. 

Incentive
Bonus 

The
Board of Directors may grant incentive bonuses to our executive officers in its sole discretion, if the Board of Directors believes such
bonuses are in the Company s best interest, after analyzing our current business objectives and growth, if any, and the amount
of revenue we are able to generate each month, which revenue is a direct result of the actions and ability of such executives. No incentive
bonuses had been granted as of December 31, 2020. 

Long-term,
Stock Based Compensation 

In
order to attract, retain and motivate executive talent necessary to support the Company s long-term business strategy we may award
certain executives with long-term, stock-based compensation in the future, in the sole discretion of our Board of Directors, which we
do not currently have any immediate plans to award.

Item

 Certain
 Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence. 

Our
officers and directors are now and may in the future become stockholders, officers or directors of other companies that may be engaged
in business activities similar to those conducted by us. Accordingly, direct conflicts of interest may arise in the future with respect
to such individuals acting on our behalf or other entities. Moreover, additional conflicts of interest may arise with respect to opportunities
which come to the attention of such individuals in the performance of their duties or otherwise. Although we do not currently have a
right of first refusal pertaining to opportunities that come to management s attention insofar as such opportunities may relate
to our business operations, we have established a conflict of interest policy intended to ensure timely disclosure and avoidance of activities
and relationships that conflict with the interests of the Company. 

Our
officers and directors are subject to the restriction that all opportunities contemplated by our business plan which come to their attention,
either in the performance of their duties or in any other manner, will be considered opportunities of, and be made available to our Company.
A breach of this requirement will be a breach of the fiduciary duties of the officer or director. 

All
future affiliated transactions will be made or entered into on terms that are no less favorable to us than those that can be obtained
from any unaffiliated third party. To the extent possible, a majority of the independent, disinterested members of our board of directors
will approve future affiliated transactions. 

On
October 2, 2018, the Company borrowed 60,000 from Igor Gabal, the sole officer and director of the Company, and on October 3, 2018,
the Company borrowed 95,000 from Tomasz Kotas, the Company s largest shareholder. Both of the promissory notes evidencing the
debts had a maturity date of August 1, 2019 and a flat interest amount of 1,000. The Company repaid Mr. Gabal s note in June 2019,
together with the accrued interest. Mr. Kotas extended the maturity date of his note to August 1, 2020. As of December 31, 2019, 17,000
of the principal and 1,000 of accrued interest remained outstanding. These amounts were paid in January and February 2020. 

In
December 2019, Mr. Gabal paid 6,276 of Company expenses and 14,726 of Company liabilities. These amounts were reimbursed in January
2020. 

On
February 21, 2019, the Company entered into a factoring agreement with an unrelated third party, Advance Business Capital LLC, dba Interstate
Capital ICC ), pursuant to which the Company sells its accounts receivable to ICC for 85 of the value of the receivable.
The term of the agreement is for 12 months and automatically renews for additional 12-month periods. The accounts receivable are sold
with recourse back to the Company, meaning that the Company bears the risk of non-payment by the account debtor. To secure its obligations
to ICC, the Company has granted a blanket security interest in its other assets, such as inventory, equipment, machinery, furniture,
fixtures, contract rights, and general intangibles. Igor Gabal, the sole officer and director of the Company, and Tomasz Kotas, the largest
shareholder of the Company, have provided their personal guarantees. On September 11, 2019, the lender (which now does business as Triumph
Business Capital) entered into an amended agreement with the Company which lowered the interest charged by the lender from 0.49 for
every 10 days to prime rate (with a floor of 5.5 plus 3 . As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company owed 649,502 and 1,414,639,
respectively, for advances on its receivables. 

19 

The
Company is currently purchasing all of its chocolate products from Millano Group, a related party (controlled by the father of Tomasz
Kotas). As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, 783,417 and 546,612, respectively, was owed to Millano Group. The balance is reflected in
accounts payable related party. 

Director
Independence 

The
Board of Directors has determined that it does not have any independent directors as that term is defined by NASDAQ Marketplace Rule
5605(a)(2). In assessing the independence of the directors, the Board considers any transactions, relationships and arrangements between
our Company and our independent directors or their affiliated companies. This review is based primarily on responses of the directors
to questions in a director and officer questionnaire regarding employment, business, familial, compensation and other relationships with
our Company or our management. 

Item
 14. 
 Principal
 Accounting Fees and Services. 

Fees
paid to our principal accountants, M K CPAS, PLLC for the 2020 and 2019 audit are 36,500. Fee paid to LJ Soldinger Associates, LLC
for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, were as follows:

 The
 amount billed or to be billed to us for professional services related to the audit of our annual financial statements for the years
 ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 included reviews of our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. 

The
Board of Directors has considered whether the provision of the non-audit services described above by an external auditor is compatible
with maintaining the auditor s independence, and determined that these non-audit services are compatible with the required independence.
The Board of Directors pre-approves all services to be provided to our Company by the independent auditors. This includes the pre-approval
of (i) all audit services and (ii) any significant (i.e., not de minimis) non-audit services. Before granting any approval, the Board
of Directors gives due consideration to whether approval of the proposed service will have a detrimental impact on the auditor s
independence. All services provided by and fees paid to our independent auditors for 2020 and 2019 were pre-approved by the Board of
Directors.
