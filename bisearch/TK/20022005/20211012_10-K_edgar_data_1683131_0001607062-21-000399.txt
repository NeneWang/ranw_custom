Forward-Looking
Information 

Statements
in this report may be forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements
that express our intentions, beliefs, expectations, strategies, predictions or any other statements relating to our future activities
or other future events or conditions. These statements are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about our business
based, in part, on assumptions made by management. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks, uncertainties
and assumptions that are difficult to predict. Therefore, actual outcomes and results may, and are likely to, differ materially from
what is expressed or forecasted in the forward-looking statements due to numerous factors, including those described above and those
risks discussed from time to time in this report, including the risks described under Risk Factors and any risks described
in any other filings we make with the SEC. Any forward-looking statements speak only as of the date on which they are made, and we do
not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this report. 

Management s
discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements, which have been prepared
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires
us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. On an on-going basis,
we evaluate these estimates, including those related to useful lives of real estate assets, cost reimbursement income, bad debts, impairment,
net lease intangibles, contingencies and litigation. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions
that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying
values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. There can be no assurance that actual results will
not differ from those estimates.

PENNY
STOCK REGULATION 

Shares
of our common stock is subject to rules adopted the SEC that regulate broker-dealer practices in connection with transactions in penny
stocks. Penny stocks are generally equity securities with a price of less than 5.00 (other than securities registered
on certain national securities exchanges or quoted on the NASDAQ system, provided that current price and volume information with respect
to transactions in those securities is provided by the exchange or system). The penny stock rules require a broker-dealer,
prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from those rules, deliver a standardized risk disclosure document prepared
by the SEC, which contains the following: 

a
 description of the nature and level of risk in the market for penny stocks in both public offerings and secondary trading; 

a
 description of the broker s or dealer s duties to the customer and of the rights and remedies available to the customer
 with respect to violation to such duties or other requirements of securities laws; 

a
 brief, clear, narrative description of a dealer market, including bid and ask prices for penny stocks
 and the significance of the spread between the bid and ask price; 

a
 toll-free telephone number for inquiries on disciplinary actions; 

definitions
 of significant terms in the disclosure document or in the conduct of trading in penny stocks; and 

such
 other information and is in such form (including language, type, size and format), as the SEC shall require by rule or regulation. 

Prior
to effecting any transaction in penny stock, the broker-dealer also must provide the customer the following: 

the
 bid and offer quotations for the penny stock; 

the
 compensation of the broker-dealer and its salesperson in the transaction; 

the
 number of shares to which such bid and ask prices apply, or other comparable information relating to the depth and liquidity of the
 market for such stock; and 

monthly
 account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer s account. 

In
addition, the penny stock rules require that prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from those rules, the broker-dealer
must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser s
written acknowledgment of the receipt of a risk disclosure statement, a written agreement to transactions involving penny stocks, and
a signed and dated copy of a written suitability statement. These disclosure requirements may have the effect of reducing
the trading activity in the secondary market for a stock that becomes subject to the penny stock rules. Holders of shares
of our common stock may have difficulty selling those shares because our common stock will probably be subject to the penny stock rules.

Critical
Accounting Estimates and Policies 

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
period. Note 2 to the Financial Statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of
the Financial Statements. Estimates are used for, but not limited to, contingencies and taxes. Actual results could differ materially
from those estimates. The following critical accounting policies are impacted significantly by judgments, assumptions, and estimates
used in the preparation of the Financial Statements. 

We
are subject to various loss contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business. We consider the likelihood of loss or impairment
of an asset or the incurrence of a liability, as well as our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss in determining loss contingencies.
An estimated loss contingency is accrued when management concludes that it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability
has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. We regularly evaluate current information available to
us to determine whether such accruals should be adjusted. 

We
recognize deferred tax assets (future tax benefits) and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences
between the book carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities. The deferred tax assets and liabilities represent the
expected future tax return consequences of those differences, which are expected to be either deductible or taxable when the assets and
liabilities are recovered or settled. Future tax benefits have been fully offset by a 100 valuation allowance as management is
unable to determine that it is more likely than not that this deferred tax asset will be realized. 

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements 

We
do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements (as that term is defined in Item 303 of Regulation S-K) that are reasonably likely to
have a current or future material effect on our financial condition, revenue or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures
or capital resources. 

Recently
Issued Accounting Standards 

The
Company has implemented all new accounting pronouncements that are in effect. These pronouncements did not have any material impact on
the financial statements unless otherwise disclosed, and the Company does not believe that there are any other new accounting pronouncements
that have been issued that might have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.

(the Exchange Act that are designed to be effective in providing reasonable assurance that information required to be
disclosed in our reports under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in
the rules and forms of the SEC, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure. 

In
designing and evaluating disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well
designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute assurance of achieving the desired objectives. Also, the design of a
control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to
their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that
all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments
in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. The design of any system of controls
is based, in part, upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will
succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. As of the end of the period covered by this report, we carried
out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our chief executive officer and principal
financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based upon that evaluation,
management concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of June 30, 2021 to cause the information
required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported
within the time periods prescribed by SEC, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our chief
executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

Report
of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 

To
the shareholders and the board of directors of Forza Innovations, Inc. 

 Opinion
on the Financial Statements 

 We
have audited the accompanying balance sheet of Forza Innovations, Inc. (the Company as of June 30, 2021, the related statement
of operations, stockholders' equity (deficit), and cash flows for the year then ended, and the related notes (collectively referred to
as the financial statements ). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of the Company as of June 30, 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended, in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. 

 Substantial
Doubt about the Company s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern 

 The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note
3 to the financial statements, the Company s significant operating losses raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue
as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

 Basis
for Opinion 

 These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's
financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal
securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

 We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company
is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits
we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion
on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

 Our
audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or
fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audit provides
a reasonable basis for our opinion.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING
FIRM 

To the Shareholders Board of Directors 

 Genesys Industries, Inc. 

Opinion on the Financial Statements 

 We have audited the accompanying balance sheet of Genesys Industries, Inc.
as of June 30, 2020 and the related statements of operations, changes in stockholders deficit, cash flows, and the related notes
(collectively referred to as financial statements for the period ended June 30, 2020. In our opinion, the financial statements
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of June 30, 2020 and the results of its operations
and its cash flows for the periods then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 

Going Concern 

 The accompanying financial statements have been prepared
assuming the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note #3 to the financial statements, although the Company has limited
operations it has yet to attain profitability. This raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management s
plan in regard to these matters is also described in Note #3. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result
from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

Basis for Opinion 

 These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our audit. We are a public
accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent
with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities
and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

 We conducted our audits in accordance with the
standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged
to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audit, we are required to obtain an understanding
of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s
internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

 Our audit included performing procedures to assess
the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond
to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating
the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

of assets). 

While
the Company is successfully executing its growth strategy, its cash position may not still be sufficient to support the Company s
daily operations without additional financing. While the Company believes in the viability of its strategy to produce sales volume and
in its ability to raise additional funds, there can be no assurances to that effect. The ability of the Company to continue as a going
concern is dependent upon the Company s ability to further implement its business plan and generate sufficient revenues. The financial
statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern. Management
believes that the actions presently being taken to further implement its business plan and generate revenues provide the opportunity
for the Company to continue as a going concern.

Net
 provision for Federal income taxes 

At
June 30, 2021, the Company had net operating loss carry forwards of approximately that may be offset against future taxable
income from the year 2022 to 2040. No tax benefit has been reported in the June 30, 2021 financial statements since the potential tax
benefit is offset by a valuation allowance of the same amount. 

Due
to the change in ownership provisions of the Tax Reform Act of 1986, net operating loss carry forwards for Federal Income tax reporting
purposes are subject to annual limitations. Should a change in ownership occur, net operating loss carry forwards may be limited as to
use in future years.
