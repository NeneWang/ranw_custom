 While forward-looking statements are our best prediction at the time that they are made, you should not rely on them and are cautioned against doing so.

Factors or events that could cause our actual results to differ may emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict all of them. 
 If a circumstance occurs after the date of this Annual Report that causes any of our forward-looking statements to be inaccurate, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise, we undertake no obligation to announce publicly the change to our expectations, or to make any revision to our forward-looking statements, to reflect any change in assumptions, beliefs or expectations, or any change in events, conditions or circumstances upon which any forward-looking statement is based, unless required by law.

OUR BUSINESS STRUCTURE 
 Through our subsidiaries, we are committed to helping investors navigate global markets, as well as continuing to evolve and build on our strengths to meet the needs of our clients. We generally derive our revenues and income from providing investment management and related services to our products and the products we sub-advise. Our investment management fees, which represent the majority of our revenues, depend to a large extent on the level and relative mix of our AUM and the types of services provided, which are subject to change. 
 Our business is conducted through our subsidiaries, including our specialist investment managers. Our specialist investment managers include subsidiaries registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC as investment advisers under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (the Advisers Act ), as well as subsidiaries registered as investment adviser equivalents in jurisdictions including Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Hong Kong, Ireland, India, Japan, Luxembourg, Malaysia, Mexico, Singapore, Switzerland, South Korea, Commonwealth of The Bahamas, the United Arab Emirates and the United Kingdom U.K. ). 
 Our U.S.-registered funds and most of our non-U.S.-registered funds operate as independent companies subject to the supervision and oversight of the funds own boards of directors or trustees. Most of our funds are registered open-end funds, or mutual funds, that continuously offer their shares to investors. We also offer or manage registered or listed closed-end funds that issue a set number of shares to investors in a public offering which shares are then traded on a public stock exchange. Our specialist investment managers manage a fund s portfolio of securities in accordance with the fund s stated objectives. To support the funds operations, our subsidiaries either provide or arrange for the investment and other management, shareholder servicing and administrative services required by the funds. We outsource certain administration and other services for our funds to third-party providers. An investor may purchase shares of a mutual fund directly from us or through a broker-dealer, financial adviser, bank or other similar financial intermediary that provides investment advice to the investor, or an investor may purchase shares of a closed-end fund or ETF on the stock exchange where the fund is traded. Financial intermediaries may earn fees and commissions and receive other compensation with respect to fund shares sold to investors. 
 Our AUM by Asset Class and Product Type 
 We offer a broad product mix under our fixed income, equity, multi-asset, alternative and cash management asset classes and solutions. Our fixed income capabilities include government, municipals, corporate credit, bank loans, securitized, multi-sector, currencies and other investments. Our equity capabilities include value, deep value, core value, blend, growth at a reasonable price (GARP), growth, convertibles, sector, Shariah, smart beta and thematic investments. Our multi-asset solutions capabilities include income, real return, balanced/hybrid, total return, target data/risk, absolute return, tactical asset allocation and managed volatility investments. Our alternative capabilities include private debt, hedge funds, private equity, real estate and infrastructure investments. 
 We believe, despite market risks, that we have a competitive advantage as a result of the economic and geographic diversity of our products available to our clients. Our U.S. funds include U.S. mutual funds, closed-end funds, ETFs and other products. Our non-U.S. funds include a variety of cross-border funds principally domiciled in Luxembourg or Ireland, registered for sale to non-U.S. investors in certain other countries, and international locally domiciled funds and products for the particular local market. Our institutional separate account services are provided to various institutions for which we serve as an investment adviser. Our retail separately managed accounts, commonly known as managed accounts or wrap programs, are sponsored by various financial institutions. We also offer and serve as investment adviser to various other products. 
 Our fees for providing investment management services are generally based on a percentage of AUM in the accounts that we advise, the asset classes of the accounts, and the types of services that we provide.

AUM by asset class and product type was as follows (primarily based on where product is domiciled): 
 (in billions) 
 as of September 30, 2021 
 U.S. Funds Non-U.S. Funds Institutional Separate Accounts Retail Separately Managed Accounts Other Total Percentage of Total AUM Fixed Income 206.3 55.5 338.6 34.3 15.6 650.3 43 Equity 260.1 87.3 66.3 87.8 22.1 523.6 34 Multi-Asset 96.5 8.7 4.3 2.9 40.0 152.4 10 Alternative 7.4 10.8 34.2 92.8 145.2 9 Cash Management

 See Assets under Management under Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, of this Annual Report for additional information about our AUM. Broadly speaking, other than changes in AUM due to acquisitions or dispositions by us, changes in our AUM depend primarily upon two factors: (i) the increase or decrease in the market value of the securities and instruments held in the portfolio of investments, and (ii) the level of inflows as compared to the level of outflows. Changing market conditions and the evolving needs of our clients may cause asset volatility and a shift in our asset mix, potentially resulting in an increase or decrease in our revenues and income depending upon the nature of our AUM and the level of management fees we earn based on our AUM. 
 Our Specialist Investment Managers 
 Our specialist investment managers offer diverse perspectives and specialized expertise across asset classes and strategies. Across our business, our specialist investment managers generally focus on a portion of the asset management industry in terms of the types of assets managed (primarily fixed income, equity or alternatives) and each may differ in the types of products and services offered, the investment styles utilized, and the types and geographic locations of its clients. Each typically markets its products and services under its own brand name, with certain distribution functions provided by our corporate distribution subsidiaries. We have in place revenue sharing arrangements with certain of our specialist investment managers. 
 Our specialist investment managers include: Benefit Street Partners, Brandywine Global, Clarion Partners, ClearBridge Investments, Fiduciary Trust International, Franklin Templeton Equity, Franklin Templeton Fixed Income, Franklin Templeton Investment Solutions, Martin Currie, Royce Investment Partners, Templeton Global Macro, and Western Asset Management. 
 Our Broad Range of Services and Capabilities 
 1. Investment Management Services 
 Through our specialist investment managers, we offer a broad range of services and capabilities under our fixed income, equity, multi-asset, alternative and cash management asset classes. We also offer diverse strategies across active, smart beta and passive approaches, in a broad range of vehicles. Our investment products are offered globally to retail, institutional and high-net-worth clients, which may include, among others, individual investors, institutional investors, sovereign wealth funds, defined benefit and contribution plans, endowments and charitable foundations, healthcare systems and insurance companies. Our investment products include mutual funds, closed-end funds, private funds, institutional separate accounts, retail separately managed accounts, and other products. Our products and capabilities are designed to accommodate a variety of investment goals and preferences, from capital appreciation to capital preservation, as well as certain environmental, social and governance ESG preferences. 
 We are committed to partnering closely with our clients to understand their challenges and aspirations, and drawing on our investment capabilities and resources to offer and/or design the right investment solutions for them. We distribute and market globally our different capabilities under our brand names through various subsidiaries and multiple points of access, including directly to investors and through financial intermediaries. We primarily engage new institutional business through our relationships with pension, defined contribution and management consultants, direct sales efforts and additional mandates from our existing client relationships, as well as from our responses to requests for proposals. We also market and distribute our products through various subsidiaries to institutional investors with separate accounts. A few of

our subsidiaries also serve as direct marketing broker-dealers for institutional investors for certain of our private funds, and some of our private funds may utilize third-party placement agents. Our services also include management of our ETF platforms. Our ETF platforms include smart beta and actively managed ETFs, as well as additional lower fee passive ETF products. ETFs trade like stocks, fluctuate in market value and may trade at prices above or below the ETF s net asset value. 
 Our specialist investment managers provide investment management services pursuant to agreements in effect with each of our investment products and/or clients, including products for which we provide sub-advisory services. Investment management fees are generally determined as a percentage of AUM pursuant to such contractual arrangements. Our investment management services include services to accounts for which we have full investment discretion and to accounts for which we have no investment discretion. Our services include fundamental investment research and valuation analyses, including original economic, political, industry and company research, and analyses of suppliers, customers and competitors. Our management fee on an account varies with the types of services that we provide for the account, among other things. 
 For our U.S. mutual funds, the board of directors or trustees of each fund and our management personnel regularly review the investment management fee structures for the funds in light of fund performance, the level and range of services provided, industry conditions and other relevant factors. Most of our investment management agreements between our subsidiaries and our U.S. mutual funds must be renewed each year after an initial two-year term, and must be specifically approved at least annually by a vote of each fund s board of directors or trustees as a whole and separately by a majority of its directors or trustees who are not interested persons of the fund under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the Investment Company Act ), or by a vote of the holders of a majority of the fund s outstanding voting securities. In addition, our U.S. agreements generally may be terminated by either party without penalty after prior written notice. 
 Our non-U.S. mutual funds, private funds, institutional and high-net-worth separate accounts, and the products for which we provide sub-advisory services, are typically subject to various termination rights and/or renewal provisions, which often provide for termination upon relatively short notice with little or no penalty. Investment management fees are at times waived or voluntarily reduced when, for example, a new fund/account is established, and then increased to contractual levels within an established timeline or as net asset values reach certain levels. 
 2. Retail Separately Managed Account Programs 
 Certain of our specialist investment managers provide asset management services to retail separately managed account programs sponsored by various financial institutions. These programs typically allow securities brokers or other financial intermediaries to offer their clients the opportunity to choose from a number of asset management services pursuing different investment strategies provided by one or more investment managers, and generally charge an all-inclusive fee that can cover asset management, trade execution, asset allocation and custodial and administrative services. 
 3. Alternative Strategies 
 Certain of our specialist investment managers manage alternative investment strategies. These strategies provide our clients with alternatives to traditional equity and fixed income products and services. Our alternative products include private credit funds and structured products, business development companies, hedge funds (funds of funds and custom advisory solutions), private equity funds, venture capital funds and real estate funds. These products employ various investment strategies and approaches, including loan origination, collateralized loan obligations, high-yield credit, hedge fund advisory, private equity and infrastructure transactions in emerging markets, global macro, financial technology, consumer loans, direct real estate investments, and custom-tailored investment programs.

4. High-Net-Worth Investment Management, Trust and Custody 
 Through our subsidiary Fiduciary Trust Company International Fiduciary Trust International ), including its trust company and investment adviser subsidiaries, and through certain other of our subsidiaries, we provide investment management and related services to, among others, high-net-worth individuals and families, family offices, foundations and institutional clients. Fiduciary Trust International offers investment management and advisory services across different investment styles and asset classes. The majority of these client assets are actively managed by individual portfolio managers, while a significant number of clients also seek multi-manager, multi-asset class solutions. Through our trust company subsidiaries, including Fiduciary Trust International, we also may provide separately managed accounts, private funds, and trust, custody and related services, including administration, performance measurement, estate planning and tax planning. In addition, through our subsidiary Fiduciary Trust Company of Canada FTCC ), we provide investment management, wealth planning, and trust and estate services, and offer products to high-net-worth individuals and families and institutional clients in Canada. 
 5. Sales and Distribution 
 Our global distribution framework is organized into two groups. Our global advisory services group is responsible for sales, marketing and business development, and maintains a regional distribution model. Our global alliances and new business strategies group oversees our digital wealth management and distribution-related financial technology, joint ventures, seed capital allocations, and direct-to-consumer initiatives. Our groups work closely together to meet the needs of our advisors, clients and investors. There are many sales channels across each region, which may include retail, institutional, private wealth, retirement, insurance, and other specialty sales. Our global footprint and breadth of investment capability provides the opportunity for us to work with global financial institutions to add value through and beyond investing, including by building business relationships and global economic partnerships. 
 In addition, certain of our specialist investment managers have their own sales and marketing teams that distribute their products and services, primarily to institutional investors, both directly and through consultants. Consultants play a large role in institutional investment management by helping clients select and retain investment managers. Institutional investment management clients and their consultants tend to be highly sophisticated and investment performance-driven. 
 Our sales and distribution capabilities and related efforts are critical components of our business and may be impacted by global distribution trends and changes within the financial services industry. In the U.S., our corporate distribution subsidiaries generally serve as the principal underwriters and distributors of shares of most of our mutual funds. Outside the U.S., certain of our non-U.S. subsidiaries provide sales, distribution and marketing services to our non-U.S. mutual funds. Some of our non-U.S. mutual funds, particularly our Luxembourg and Irish domiciled fund ranges, are distributed globally on a cross-border basis, while others are distributed exclusively in local markets. 
 We earn sales and distribution fees primarily by distributing our mutual funds pursuant to distribution agreements with the funds. Under our distribution agreements with our U.S. mutual funds, we offer and sell the fund shares on a continuous basis and pay certain costs associated with selling, marketing and distributing the fund shares, including the costs of developing and producing sales literature, shareholder reports and prospectuses. Our sales and distribution fees primarily consist of upfront sales commissions and ongoing distribution fees. Sales commissions are earned from the sale of certain classes of sponsored funds at the time of purchase and may be reduced or eliminated depending on the amount invested and the type of investor. Therefore, our sales fees generally will change with the overall level of gross sales, the size of individual transactions, and the relative mix of sales between different share classes and types of investors. 
 Our mutual funds generally pay us distribution fees in return for sales, marketing and distribution efforts on their behalf. The majority of our U.S. mutual funds, with the exception of certain money market funds and certain other funds specifically designed for purchase through separately managed account programs, have adopted distribution plans under Rule 12b-1 (the Rule 12b-1 Plans promulgated under the Investment Company Act. The Rule 12b-1 Plans permit the funds to pay us for marketing, marketing support, advertising, printing and sales promotion services relating to the distribution of their shares, subject to the Rule 12b-1 Plans limitations on amounts based on daily average AUM. Similar arrangements exist for the distribution of non-U.S. mutual funds. The Rule 12b-1 Plans are established for one-year terms and must be approved annually by a vote of each fund s board of directors or trustees as a whole and separately by a majority of its directors or trustees who are not interested persons of the fund under the Investment Company Act. The Rule 12b-1 Plans are subject to termination at any time by a majority vote of the disinterested fund directors or trustees or by the particular fund s shareholders.

Table of Contents 

We pay substantially all of our sales and distribution fees earned as revenues, including fees earned under the Rule 12b-1 Plans, to the financial advisers and other intermediaries that sell our funds on our behalf. The distribution agreements with our U.S. mutual funds generally provide for us to pay commission expenses for sales of fund shares to qualifying broker-dealers and other independent financial intermediaries. These financial intermediaries receive various sales commissions and other fees for services in matching investors with funds whose asset classes match such investors goals and risk profiles. The intermediaries also may receive fees for their assistance in explaining the operations of the funds and in servicing and maintaining investors accounts, and for reporting and various other distribution services. Other compensation may be offered to the extent not prohibited by federal or state laws or any self-regulatory agency, such as the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority FINRA ), applicable to our business. We are heavily dependent upon these third-party distribution and sales channels and business relationships. There is increasing competition for access to these channels, which has caused our distribution costs to rise and could cause further increases in the future as competition continues and service expectations increase. 
 Similar arrangements exist with the distribution of our non-U.S. mutual funds where, generally, our subsidiary that distributes the funds receives maintenance fees from the funds and pays commissions and certain other fees to financial advisers, banks and other intermediaries. 
 6. Shareholder Servicing 
 We perform our shareholder servicing services directly or through third parties. Substantially all shareholder servicing fees are earned from our funds for providing transfer agency services, which include providing shareholder statements, transaction processing, customer service and tax reporting. Fees for U.S. funds are based on the level of AUM and the number of transactions in shareholder accounts, while outside of the U.S., the fees are based on the level of AUM and/or the number of shareholder accounts. 
 
 COMPETITION 
 The financial services industry is a highly competitive global industry. Competition is based on various factors, including, among others, business reputation, investment performance, product mix and offerings, service quality and innovation, distribution relationships, and fees charged. We face strong competition from numerous investment management companies, securities brokerage and investment banking firms, insurance companies, banks and other financial institutions, which offer a wide range of financial and investment management services and products to the same retail, institutional and high-net-worth investors and accounts that we are seeking to attract. We offer a broad product mix that meets a variety of investment goals and needs for different investors, and we may periodically introduce new products to provide investors with additional investment options. 
 Due to our international presence and varied product mix, it is difficult to assess our market position relative to other investment managers on a worldwide basis, but we believe that we are one of the more widely diversified investment managers based in the U.S. We believe that our fixed income, equity, multi-asset and alternative asset mix, coupled with our global presence, will serve our competitive needs well over the long term. We continue to focus on the long-term performance of our investment products, service to clients and extensive marketing activities through our strong broker-dealer and other financial institution distribution network as well as with high-net-worth and institutional clients. 
 The establishment of new investment management firms and continuous development of investment products increases the competition that we face. Many of our competitors have long-standing and established relationships with broker-dealers, investment advisers and their clients, and some have affiliated brokerage businesses. Others have focused on, offer and market specific product lines that provide strong competition to certain of our asset classes. In addition, consolidation in the financial services industry has created stronger competitors, some with greater financial resources and broader distribution channels than our own.

REGULATION 
 General 
 We are subject to extensive regulation. Virtually all aspects of our business are subject to various U.S. federal and state, and/or international regulation and supervision. Our regulators have broad authority with respect to the regulation of investment management and other financial services, including among other things, the authority to grant or cancel required licenses or registrations, impose net capital and other financial or operational requirements on us, and other enforcement powers described below. The regulations to which we are subject continue to change and evolve over time. Consequently, there is uncertainty associated with the regulatory environments in which we operate. The rules and regulations applicable to investment management organizations are very detailed and technical. Accordingly, the discussion below is general in nature and does not purport to be complete. 
 With our global operations, certain of our subsidiaries are registered with or licensed by various U.S. and/or non-U.S. regulators, and our funds are subject to various U.S. and/or non-U.S. laws. In particular, we are subject to various securities, compliance, corporate governance, disclosure, privacy, anti-bribery and anti-corruption, anti-money laundering, anti-terrorist financing, and economic, trade and sanctions laws and regulations, both domestically and internationally, as well as to various cross-border rules and regulations, such as the anti-bribery and anti-corruption rules under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 FCPA and the data protection rules under the General Data Protection Regulation GDPR of the European Union EU ). We are subject to sanctions programs administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the U.S. Department of Treasury USDT ), as well as sanctions programs adopted and administered by non-U.S. jurisdictions where our services and products are offered. Our subsidiaries with custody of client assets or accounts are also subject to the applicable laws and regulations of U.S. states and other non-U.S. jurisdictions regarding the reporting and escheatment of unclaimed or abandoned property. We also must comply with complex and changing tax regimes in the jurisdictions where we operate our business. 
 Failure to comply with applicable U.S. and non-U.S. laws, regulations, rules, codes, notices, directives, guidelines, orders, circulars and/or conditions in the various jurisdictions where we operate could result in a wide range of disciplinary actions against us, our subsidiaries and/or our business. Breaches of applicable laws and rules could result in regulatory enforcement, civil liability, criminal liability and/or the imposition of a range of sanctions or orders against us, including, as applicable, monetary damages, injunctions, disgorgements, fines, penalties, cease and desist orders, censures, reprimands, and the revocation, cancellation, suspension or restriction of licenses, registration status or approvals held by us or our business in a jurisdiction or market. In addition, a public regulatory issue can have a negative impact on our reputation, and as a result have indirect impacts on our business or growth. 
 See Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, of this Annual Report, for financial information about our business, including certain regulatory financial impacts disclosed therein. 
 U.S. Regulation 
 U.S. Regulatory Framework. As a U.S. reporting company, we are subject to U.S. federal securities laws, state securities and corporate laws, state escheatment laws and regulations, and the rules and regulations of certain U.S. regulatory and self-regulatory organizations, such as the SEC and the NYSE. In particular, we are subject to various securities, compliance, corporate governance and disclosure rules adopted by the SEC. We are also subject to various other U.S. federal and state laws, including those affecting corporate governance and disclosure, such as the Securities Act of 1933, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Exchange Act ), the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 Dodd-Frank ), the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001. As a NYSE-listed company, we are also subject to NYSE listing and disclosure requirements. 
 As a global investment management organization, certain of our subsidiaries are also subject to the rules and regulations of various U.S. regulatory and self-regulatory organizations, including the SEC, FINRA, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission CFTC ), the National Futures Association, the U.S. Department of Justice DOJ ), the U.S. Department of Labor, and the USDT. Our non-U.S. operations also may be subject to regulation by U.S. regulators, including the SEC, the CFTC and the DOJ (for example with respect to the FCPA).

Table of Contents 

Certain of our subsidiaries are registered with the SEC under the Advisers Act and/or the CFTC, and many of our funds are registered with the SEC under the Investment Company Act. These registrations, licenses and authorizations impose numerous obligations, as well as detailed operational requirements, on such subsidiaries and funds. The Advisers Act imposes numerous obligations on our registered investment adviser subsidiaries, including record keeping, operating and marketing requirements, disclosure obligations and prohibitions against fraudulent activities. The Investment Company Act imposes similar obligations on the registered investment companies advised by our subsidiaries. 
 U.S. Regulatory Reforms. Over the years, the U.S. federal corporate governance and securities laws have been augmented substantially and made significantly more complex by various legislation. As we continue to address our legal and regulatory requirements or focus on meeting new or expanded requirements, we may need to expend a substantial amount of additional time, costs and resources. Regulatory reforms may add further complexity to our business and operations and could require us to alter our investment management services and related activities, which could be costly, impede our growth and adversely impact our AUM, revenues and income. Certain key regulatory reforms in the U.S. that impact or relate to our business, and may cause, or continue to cause, us to incur additional obligations, include: 
 Systemically Important Financial Institutions. Dodd-Frank authorized the establishment of the Financial Stability Oversight Council FSOC ), the mandate of which is to identify and respond to threats to U.S. financial stability. Similarly, the U.S. and other members of the G-20 group of nations have empowered the Financial Stability Board FSB to identify and respond, in a coordinated manner, to threats to global financial stability. The FSOC may designate certain non-bank financial companies as systemically important financial institutions SIFIs ), which are subject to supervision and regulation by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. The FSB may designate certain non-bank financial companies as global systemically important financial institutions G-SIFIs the additional regulatory requirements triggered by any such designation are not yet established. The FSOC and the FSB, as well as other global regulators, are considering what threats to U.S. and global financial stability, if any, arise from asset management companies and/or the funds that they sponsor or manage, and whether such threats can be mitigated by treating such entities as SIFIs or G-SIFIs and/or subjecting them to additional regulation. To the extent that we or any of our funds are designated as a SIFI or G-SIFI, such designations add additional supervision and/or regulation, which could include requirements related to risk-based capital, leverage, liquidity, credit exposure, stress testing, resolution plans, early remediation, and certain risk management requirements, that could impact our business. 
 Derivatives and Other Financial Products. Dodd-Frank, as well as other legislation and regulations, impose restrictions and limitations on us related to our financial services and products, resulting in increased scrutiny and oversight. Regulators continue to review practices and regulations relating to the use of futures, swaps and other derivatives, which could result in further restrictions and limitations on the use of such products. In October 2020, the SEC adopted new rules governing the use of derivatives by certain registered investment companies, including certain mutual funds, designed to address investor protection concerns. Subject to its August 2022 compliance date, key aspects of the new framework will include, among other things, value at risk limits on a fund entering into derivatives transactions, required risk management program, and further fund board oversight, reporting and compliance requirements. The EU and other countries have adopted and implemented, or are in the process of adopting or implementing, similar and additional requirements. There is some risk that full mutual recognition may not be achieved between the various regulators, which may cause us to incur duplicate regulation and transaction costs. 
 Money Market Funds . SEC rules have changed the structure and operation for certain types of money market funds, and certain U.S.-registered funds are required to adopt liquidity management programs. In 2016, the regulatory structure governing U.S. money market funds was reformed to address perceived systemic risks of money market funds relating to fund stability and investor risks, including allowing certain funds to impose liquidity fees and redemption gates under certain circumstances. In addition, following market liquidity issues in March 2020 related to the COVID-19 pandemic, regulatory authorities remain focused on whether to implement further reform measures to improve the resiliency of money market funds and the broader short-term funding markets, which, if adopted, could significantly impact the money market fund industry. 
 Privacy and Data Protection. There also has been increased regulation with respect to the protection of customer privacy and data, and the need to secure sensitive customer, personnel and others information. A majority of the jurisdictions where we operate are covered, or we expect will be soon covered, by privacy and data protection laws and regulations. As the regulatory focus on privacy continues to intensify and laws and regulations concerning the management of personal data continue to expand, risks related to privacy and data collection within our business will increase. In addition to the EU s GDPR data protection rules, we also are or may become subject to or affected by additional country,

Table of Contents 

federal and state laws, regulations and guidance impacting consumer privacy, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act CCPA that provides for enhanced consumer protections for California residents, enforcement authority by the California Attorney General for CCPA violations, and the potential for private litigation, including statutory damages for data security breaches. The EU s GDPR strengthened and unified data protection rules for individuals within the EU and addresses export of personal data outside the EU. The primary objectives of GDPR are to give citizens control of their personal data and to simplify the regulatory environment for international business by unifying data protection regulation within the EU. Compliance with the stringent data protection rules under GDPR requires ongoing review of our global data processing systems. There are also new laws that have been adopted in recent years, including, for example, Brazil s Lei Geral de Prote o de Dados with regulatory enforcement as of August 2021, and the California Privacy Rights Act with an effective date of January 1, 2023. 
 SEC Regulation Best Interest. In June 2019, the SEC adopted a package of new rules, amendments and interpretations, including Regulation Best Interest and a new form of relationship summary, designed to enhance investor protections for all retail customers. Since June 30, 2020, such rules, among other things: (i) require broker-dealers to act in the best interest of their retail customers when recommending securities and account types, (ii) raise the broker-dealer standard of conduct beyond existing suitability obligations, and (iii) require broker-dealers and registered investment advisers to provide their retail clients with a new relationship summary disclosure document to inform such clients of the nature of their relationships with the clients investment professionals, including a description of services offered, the legal standards of conduct that apply to such services, the fees a client might pay, and conflicts of interest that may exist. 
 U.S. and Global Tax Compliance. Our business may be directly or indirectly affected by tax legislation and regulation, or the modification of existing tax laws, by applicable tax and other governmental authorities. The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, an intergovernmental organization, has focused on addressing the tax challenges of the digitalization of the economy, which may further impact multinational businesses by allocating a greater share of taxing rights to countries where consumers are located regardless of the current physical presence of a business, and by implementing a global minimum tax. We will continue to monitor developments regarding such matters and any significant impacts on our effective tax rate. 
 Non-U.S. Regulation 
 Our operations outside the U.S. are subject to the laws and regulations of various non-U.S. jurisdictions and non-U.S. regulatory agencies and bodies. Our international operations are subject to regulatory systems in various jurisdictions, comparable to those covering our operations in the U.S. 
 European Markets and Regulation. In Luxembourg, the Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier CSSF currently regulates our substantial activities in Luxembourg, including our subsidiary Franklin Templeton International Services S. r.l. FTIS Lux ). FTIS Lux is licensed as a management company for both the Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities Directive UCITS and alternative investment funds AIFs and, as such, it manages our Luxembourg-domiciled UCITS and our EU-domiciled AIFs. FTIS Lux s license also covers certain MiFID (as defined below) investment services, such as discretionary portfolio management, investment advice and reception and transmission of orders in relation to financial instruments. The CSSF s rules include capital resource, governance and risk management requirements, business conduct rules, remuneration rules and oversight of systems and controls. 
 Our international funds include two broad ranges of cross-border UCITS that are domiciled in Luxembourg and Ireland, respectively, and thereby subject to regulation by the CSSF and the Central Bank of Ireland. Both UCITS are also registered for public sale in many countries around the world, both in the EU and beyond, and thus are also subject to the laws of, and certain supervision by, the governmental authorities of those countries. 
 In the U.K., the Financial Conduct Authority (the FCA and the Prudential Regulation Authority (the PRA currently regulate certain of our subsidiaries. Authorization by the FCA and the PRA is required to conduct any financial services-related business in the U.K. pursuant to the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000. The FCA s and PRA s rules under that act govern a firm s capital resources requirements, senior management arrangements, business conduct, interaction with clients, and systems and controls.

In addition to the above, certain of our other European subsidiaries and branches, must comply with the pan-European regime established by the EU Markets in Financial Instruments Directive MiFID ), which regulates the provision of investment services and conduct of investment activities throughout the European Economic Area EEA ). MiFID sets out detailed requirements governing the organization and business conduct of investment firms and regulated markets. It also includes pre- and post-trade transparency requirements for equity markets and extensive transaction reporting requirements. Luxembourg and the U.K. have adopted the MiFID rules into national legislation, as have those other EU member states in which we have a presence. 
 A review of MiFID by the European Commission led to the creation of a replacement directive and regulation (together MiFID II that extend the scope of the original MiFID. Changes apply to pre- and post-trade reporting obligations and there is an expansion of the types of instruments subject to these requirements, such as bonds, structured products and derivatives. A concept of trading venue was created and algorithmic trading is subject to specific regulations. There were also changes to business conduct requirements, including selling practices, intermediary inducements and client categorization, as well as the provision of investment advice and management within the EU by non-EU advisers, including ours. Powers have also been given to EU national regulators to ban certain services and products and to the European Securities and Markets Authority to restrict temporarily certain financial activities within the EU. 
 MiFID II also includes a ban on commission and other payments inducements to independent advisers and discretionary managers, which has changed the commercial relationships between fund providers and distributors. Arrangements with non-independent advisers have also been affected, as narrower rules around the requirement that any commission reflect an enhancement of the service to customers come into effect, along with a prescriptive list of permissible non-monetary benefits. The interpretation of the inducements rules has also resulted in major changes to how fund managers finance investment research with many firms, including ours, opting to pay for third-party investment research for client accounts covered by MiFID II. 
 The European Market Infrastructure Regulation sets out rules in relation to the central clearing of specified derivatives. Mutual recognition of central counterparties has been achieved between the EU regulatory authorities and other important jurisdictions including the U.S. In addition, there are rules relating to margin requirements for uncleared over-the-counter derivatives. Future regulatory policy reviews will decide whether these rules are extended to other types of derivative instruments, which could increase operational costs for our business and transactional costs for our clients. 
 The EU s Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive AIFMD regulates managers of, and service providers to, AIFs that are domiciled and offered in the EU and that are not authorized as retail funds under UCITS. The AIFMD also regulates the marketing within the EU of all AIFs, including those domiciled outside the EU. The introduction of a third-country passport to non-EU AIFs/AIF managers has been delayed until further positive advice is delivered to the European Commission regarding a sufficient number of non-EU countries to better evaluate the impact, including with respect to the withdrawal of the U.K. from the EU. Compliance with the AIFMD s requirements may restrict AIF marketing and imposes compliance obligations in the form of remuneration policies, capital requirements, reporting requirements, leverage oversight, valuation, stakes in EU companies, the domicile, duties and liability of custodians and liquidity management. 
 The EU regulation on packaged retail investment and insurance products PRIIPs imposed new pre-contractual disclosure requirements under the form of a Key Information Document KID for the benefit of retail investors when they are considering the purchase of packaged retail investment products or insurance-based products. It requires PRIIP manufacturers to draw up a KID that can be no longer than three pages in length and must be written in simple language. The regulation allows UCITS providers, who are already required to produce the UCITS Key Investor Information Document, a transitional period until July 2022, during which period they will be exempt from its terms. 
 The EU s Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation SFDR came into effect in March 2021, imposing mandatory ESG disclosure obligations on asset managers and other financial markets participants. It requires all covered firms to disclose how financial products integrate sustainability risks in the investment process, including whether they consider adverse sustainability impacts, and, for those products promoting sustainable objectives, the provision of sustainability-related information. Related amendments to the MiFID, UCITS and AIFMD legislation require that all covered investment managers must consider in their investment process any ESG risks which are likely to have a material impact on the value of the investment, and require investment advisers to inquire as to the investor s desire for ESG-focused products in their portfolio when assessing suitability. The availability of these sustainability disclosures may impact the investment decisions of European investors.

British Exit from the EU Brexit ). The U.K. withdrew from the EU on January 31, 2020, and a post-Brexit U.K./EU trade agreement was subsequently approved by the EU in April 2021. While we are continuing to monitor the impact and related developments for our clients from an investment perspective, we believe that Brexit will not have a material impact on the way our firm operates in the U.K. or within the EU. Our long-standing U.K. businesses are expected to continue to provide their services to U.K. and certain non-EU customers. Furthermore, we have regulated subsidiaries and branch offices across continental Europe to manage our EU business. Moreover, our primary cross-border UCITS, the Franklin Templeton Investment Funds Soci t d Investissement Capital Variable, or SICAV, investment fund range, which is the most widely-distributed such range in the world, is based in Luxembourg, and a smaller cross-border UCITS, also distributed throughout the EU and beyond, is based in Ireland. We have separate, U.K.-domiciled fund ranges that are, and will continue to be, distributed mainly in the U.K. 
 Australia. In Australia, our subsidiaries are subject to various Australian federal and state laws and are regulated by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission ASIC ). ASIC regulates companies, financial markets and financial services in Australia. ASIC imposes certain conditions on licensed financial services organizations that apply to our subsidiaries, including requirements relating to capital resources, operational capability and controls. 
 Canada. In Canada, our subsidiaries are subject to provincial and territorial laws and are registered with and regulated by provincial and territorial securities regulatory authorities. The mandate of Canadian securities regulatory authorities is generally to protect investors and to foster fair and efficient capital markets. Securities regulatory authorities impose certain requirements on registrants, including a standard of conduct, capital and insurance, record keeping, regulatory financial reporting, conflict of interest management, compliance systems and security holder reporting. In addition, as a federally licensed trust company, FTCC is subject to regulation and supervision by the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions and another subsidiary, FTC Investor Services Inc., is a member of and regulated by the Mutual Fund Dealers Association of Canada. These regulatory bodies have similar requirements to those of the securities regulatory authorities with a view to ensuring the capital adequacy and sound business practices of the subsidiaries and the appropriate treatment of their clients. 
 In December 2019, rule amendments to implement the client focused reforms initiative of the Canadian Securities Administrators CSA ), the umbrella organization of provincial and territorial securities regulatory authorities, became effective, with reforms phased in during a two-year transition period. These rule amendments, among other things, enhance current registrant requirements in the areas of know your client, know your product, suitability, conflicts of interest and relationship disclosure information. In addition, the CSA has published final rule amendments to become effective in June 2022 in connection with its mutual fund fee reform project. The final amendments prohibit: (i) all forms of deferred sales charges in connection with the purchase of mutual fund securities, and (ii) the payment of trailing commissions to discount brokers in respect of their distribution of mutual fund securities. 
 Cayman Islands. In the Cayman Islands, the Cayman Islands Monetary Authority CIMA is responsible for the regulation and supervision of financial services, the monitoring of compliance with anti-money laundering regulations, and the issuance of statements of principle and guidance. In February 2020, the Cayman Islands enacted the Private Funds Law 2020 (the Private Funds Law ), which requires private funds that engage in business in or from the Cayman Islands to register with CIMA, unless an exemption applies. The Private Funds Law applies to any Cayman Islands closed-end fund. Open-end funds such as hedge funds continue to be regulated by the Mutual Funds Law in the Cayman Islands. The registration requirements applicable to our private funds domiciled in the Cayman Islands have posed, and may continue to pose, additional compliance costs and burdens on our business. 
 Hong Kong. In Hong Kong, our applicable subsidiaries are subject to the Securities and Futures Ordinance SFO and its subsidiary legislation, which governs the securities and futures markets and regulates, among others, offers of investments to the public and provides for the licensing of dealing in securities and asset management activities and intermediaries. This legislation is administered by the Securities and Futures Commission SFC ). The SFC is also empowered under the SFO to establish standards for compliance as well as codes and guidelines. Our subsidiaries and employees conducting any of the regulated activities specified in the SFO are required to be licensed with the SFC, and are subject to the rules, codes and guidelines issued by the SFC from time to time. 
 India. The Securities and Exchange Board of India, Reserve Bank of India, the Ministry of Corporate Affairs and the Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion are the major regulatory authorities that are capable of issuing directions of a binding nature to our subsidiaries in India.

Japan. In Japan, our subsidiaries are subject to the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act and the Act on Investment Trusts and Investment Corporations. These laws are administered and enforced by the Japanese Financial Services Agency, which establishes standards for compliance, including capital adequacy and financial soundness requirements, customer protection requirements, and business conduct rules. 
 Singapore. In Singapore, our subsidiaries are subject to, among others, the Securities and Futures Act SFA ), the Financial Advisers Act FAA and the subsidiary legislation promulgated pursuant to these Acts, which are administered by the Monetary Authority of Singapore MAS ). Our asset management subsidiaries and their employees conducting regulated activities specified in the SFA and/or the FAA are required to be licensed with the MAS. 
 Other Non-U.S. Jurisdictions. There are similar legal and regulatory arrangements in effect in many other non-U.S. jurisdictions where our subsidiaries, branches and representative offices, as well as certain joint ventures or companies in which we own minority stakes, are authorized to conduct business. We are also subject to regulation and supervision by, among others, the Securities Commission of The Bahamas, the Central Bank of Brazil and the Comiss o de Valores Mobili rios in Brazil, the China Securities Regulatory Commission in the People s Republic of China, the Financial Services Commission and the Financial Supervisory Service in South Korea, the Securities Commission in Malaysia, the Comision Nacional Bancaria y de Valores in Mexico, the Polish Securities and Exchange Commission, the Romanian Financial Services Authority, the Swiss Federal Banking Commission, the Financial Supervisory Commission in the Republic of China, the Dubai Financial Services Authority in the United Arab Emirates, and the State Securities Commission of Vietnam.

If our brand is harmed, our future business prospects may be adversely affected. 
 
 HUMAN CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 As of September 30, 2021, we employed approximately 10,300 employees and operated offices in over 30 countries. We depend upon our key personnel to manage our business, including our portfolio managers, investment analysts, investment advisers, sales and management personnel and other professionals as well as our executive officers and business unit heads. Competition for experienced personnel is significant and from time to time we may experience a loss of valuable personnel. The retention of our key investment personnel is material to the management of our business. 
 At an enterprise level, we use employee surveys to understand sentiment and engagement in the organization. At a team level, our performance management system supports ongoing, active discussion about goals and objectives. We also host live forums for leaders to engage directly with employees to help reinforce our culture of open feedback. Our employees have access to a valuable set of equitable and competitive total rewards, which consists of a mix of monetary and non-monetary rewards designed to recognize their time, talents and results. 
 We believe that our ability to attract, develop and cultivate a sense of belonging and retain a diverse, highly skilled workforce is important to our long-term success and that creating and maintaining all aspects of diversity, including backgrounds and perspectives, makes us a better place to work and a more resilient business. To accomplish this, we have developed strategies and initiatives to diversify talent within our organization. We consider an inclusive culture that actively leverages the expertise and perspectives of our diverse workforce an important factor in our ability to deliver innovative and relevant client solutions in a dynamic marketplace.

 Item 1A. Risk Factors. 
 PANDEMIC-RELATED RISKS 
 Our business and operations are subject to adverse effects from the outbreak and spread of contagious diseases such as COVID-19, which adverse effects may continue. 
 The outbreak and spread of contagious diseases such as COVID-19 has adversely affected, and may continue to adversely affect, our business, financial condition and results of operations. The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a widespread global public health crisis. Such infectious illness outbreaks or other adverse public health developments in countries where we operate, as well as local, state and/or national government restrictive measures implemented to control such outbreaks, could adversely affect the economies of many nations or the entire global economy, the financial condition of individual issuers or companies and capital markets, in ways that cannot necessarily be foreseen, and such impacts could be significant and long term. Such extraordinary events and their aftermaths can cause investor fear and panic, which can further adversely affect the operations and performance of companies, sectors, nations, regions and financial markets in general and in ways that cannot necessarily be foreseen. The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected global economies and markets, and has resulted in disruptions in commerce that will continue to evolve, including with respect to financial and other economic activities, services, travel and supply chains. Global health concerns and uncertainty regarding the impact of COVID-19 could lead to further and/or increased volatility in global capital and credit markets, adversely affect our key executives and other personnel, clients, investors, providers, suppliers, lessees, and other third parties, and negatively impact our AUM, revenues, income, business and operations. 
 Our business has been and may continue to be negatively impacted by the current COVID-19 pandemic, including by the potential reoccurrence of periods of increased spread of COVID-19 and/or COVID-19 variants, and ensuing economic downturn in global financial markets. The global spread of COVID-19, and the various governmental actions and economic effects related to the pandemic, have had, and may continue to have, negative impacts on our business and operations, including volatility in asset values, reduced demand for our products and services, concerns for and restrictions on our personnel (including health concerns, quarantines, shelter-in-place orders and restrictions on travel), and increased privacy and cybersecurity risks. Past economic downturns, including in connection with COVID-19, have caused, and future economic downturns may cause, periods of significant volatility in our stock price; fluctuations in our AUM, revenues and income; increased liquidity risks and redemptions from our funds and other products; difficulties obtaining cash to settle redemptions; fund closures; poor investment performance of our products and corporate investments; and reputational harm, legal claims and other factors that may arise or develop. Increased liquidity risks and redemptions in our funds and other products have required, and may at times require, increased cash in the form of loans or other lines of credit for them to draw on to help settle redemptions and for other related purposes. We have in some cases voluntarily determined to, and without obligation could in the future, extend such loans to our products. In addition, such increased liquidity risks and redemptions have caused, and could continue to cause, fund closures and related regulatory and governmental reviews or investigations and legal claims or actions, subjecting us to legal and regulatory risks and potential financial exposure. 
 Our business operations are complex and conducted in numerous countries around the globe, and in order to remain competitive, we must continue to perform our asset management and related business responsibilities for our clients and investors properly and effectively throughout the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, which, among other matters, is dependent on the health and safety of our personnel, the ability of our personnel to work remotely successfully, and our ability to have our personnel return to work at our offices safely and effectively in compliance with applicable requirements. We have implemented our business continuity plans globally to manage our business during this pandemic, including broad and extended work-from-home capabilities for our personnel where feasible and, as governmental health orders may allow in various jurisdictions based on applicable conditions, we have implemented and are continuing to implement measures for the return of personnel to our offices. We can provide no assurance that our efforts and planning for either environment will be sufficient to protect the health and safety of our personnel and maintain the success of our business. Further, we depend on a number of third-party providers to support our operations, and any failure of our

providers to fulfill their obligations could adversely impact our business. Moreover, since implementing broad work-from-home measures during the pandemic, we have an increased dependency on remote equipment and connectivity infrastructure to access critical business systems that may be subject to failure, disruption or unavailability that could negatively impact our business operations. Additionally, multiple regions in which we operate have had, and as conditions change may again have or continue to have, movement restrictions on our personnel and third-party vendors and service providers that may impact our ability to satisfy or respond timely to potential technology issues or needs impacting our business and operations. Further, we, like many others during this time, have been subject to increased phishing and other social engineering attempts by malicious actors to manipulate individuals into divulging confidential or personal information. If our cybersecurity diligence and efforts to offset the increased risks associated with greater reliance on mobile, collaborative and remote technologies during this pandemic are not effective or successful, we will be at increased risk for cybersecurity or data privacy incidents. 
 Any inability to recover successfully following the COVID-19 pandemic with respect to the economic, investment or operational impacts to our company or industry could further negatively impact our business and operations. As of the time of this filing, as the COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve, it is not possible to predict the full extent to which the pandemic may adversely impact our business, liquidity, capital resources, financial results and operations, which impacts will depend on numerous developing factors that remain uncertain and subject to change. The impacts and risks described herein relating to COVID-19 augment the discussion of overlapping risks in our risk factors below, which may be heightened by COVID-19. 
 MARKET AND VOLATILITY RISKS 
 Volatility and disruption of our business and financial markets and adverse changes in the global economy may significantly affect our results of operations and put pressure on our financial results. 
 We derive substantially all of our operating revenues and income from providing investment management and related services to investors in jurisdictions worldwide through our investment products, which include our funds, as well as institutional and high-net-worth separate accounts, retail separately managed account programs, sub-advised products, and other investment vehicles. In addition to investment management, our services include fund administration, sales and distribution, and shareholder servicing. We may perform services directly or through third parties. The asset management industry continues to experience disruption and challenges, including increased fee pressure, regulatory changes, an increasing and changing role of technology in asset management services, the continuous introduction of new products and services, and the consolidation of financial services firms through mergers and acquisitions. Further, financial markets have and may continue, from time to time, to experience volatility and disruption worldwide. Declines in global economic conditions have in the past resulted in significant decreases in our AUM, revenues and income, and future declines may further negatively impact our financial results. Such declines have had, and may in the future have, a material adverse impact on our business. We may need to modify our business, strategies or operations and we may be subject to additional constraints or costs in order to compete in a changing global economy and business environment. 
 Individual financial, equity, debt and commodity markets may be adversely affected by financial, economic, political, electoral, diplomatic or other instabilities that are particular to the country or region in which a market is located, including without limitation local acts of terrorism, economic crises, political protests, war, insurrection or other business, social or political crises. Global economic conditions, exacerbated by war, terrorism, social, civil or political unrest, natural disasters, public health crises, such as epidemics or pandemics, or financial crises, changes in the equity, debt or commodity marketplaces, changes in currency exchange rates, interest rates, inflation rates, the yield curve, defaults by trading counterparties, bond defaults, revaluation and bond market liquidity risks, geopolitical risks, the imposition of economic sanctions and other factors that are difficult to predict, affect the mix, market values and levels of our AUM. Changing market conditions could also cause an impairment to the value of our goodwill and other intangible assets. 
 The amount and mix of our AUM are subject to significant fluctuations, and a shift in our asset mix toward lower-fee products may negatively impact our revenues and income . 
 Fluctuations in the amount and mix of our AUM may be attributable in part to market conditions outside of our control that have had, and in the future could have, a negative impact on our revenues and income. The level of our revenues depends largely on the level and relative mix of AUM. Our investment management fee revenues are based primarily on a percentage of AUM and vary with the nature and strategies of our products. Any decrease in the value or amount of our AUM because of market volatility or other factors, such as asset outflows or a decline in the price of stocks, 
 
 17 

Table of Contents 

in particular market segments or in the securities market generally, negatively impacts our revenues and income. Changing market conditions and investor preferences may cause a shift in our asset mix toward certain lower fee products, such as fixed income products and ETFs, and away from higher fee equity and multi-asset products, which may cause a related decline in our revenues and income. In addition, increases in interest rates, particularly if rapid, as well as uncertainty in the future direction of interest rates, may have a negative impact on our fixed income products and decrease the total return on bond investments due to lower market valuations of existing bonds. Moreover, we generally derive higher investment management and distribution fees from our international products than from our U.S. products, and higher sales fees from our U.S. products than from our international products. Changing market conditions may cause a shift in our asset mix between international and U.S. products, potentially resulting in a decline in our revenues and income depending upon the nature of our AUM and the level of fees we earn on that AUM. 
 Our funds may be subject to liquidity risks or an unanticipated large number of redemptions and fund closures. 
 Due to market volatility or other events or conditions described above, our funds may need to sell securities or instruments that they hold, possibly at a loss, or draw on any available lines of credit, to obtain cash to maintain sufficient liquidity or settle these redemptions, or settle in-kind with securities held in the applicable fund. While we have no legal or contractual obligation to do so, we have in the past provided, and may in the future at our discretion provide, financial support to our funds to enable them to maintain sufficient liquidity in any such event. Changes in investor preferences regarding our more popular products have in the past caused, and could in the future cause, sizable redemptions and lower the value of our AUM, which would result in lower revenue and operating results. Increased market volatility and changes in investor preferences also increase the risk of fund closures. Any decrease in the level of our AUM resulting from market declines, credit or interest rate volatility or uncertainty, increased redemptions or other factors could negatively impact our revenues and income. 
 We may not effectively manage risks associated with the replacement of benchmark indices. 
 The withdrawal and replacement of widely used benchmark indices such as the London Interbank Offered Rate LIBOR with alternative benchmark rates may introduce a number of risks for our business, our clients and the financial services industry more widely. These include financial risks arising from potential changes in the valuation of financial instruments linked to benchmark indices, pricing and operational risks, and legal implementation and revised documentation risks. In March 2021, the FCA in the U.K., which regulates LIBOR, announced that LIBOR will no longer be provided for various currency settings after 2021, including all sterling, euro and certain U.S. dollar settings. Although the Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR has been identified as a recommended alternative reference rate to LIBOR, the selection of SOFR presents certain market concerns because a term structure for SOFR has not yet developed and there is not yet a generally accepted methodology for adjusting SOFR. Accordingly, the withdrawal and replacement of LIBOR may pose financial risks and uncertainties to our business. We also may face operational challenges adopting successor benchmarks. 
 INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE AND REPUTATIONAL RISKS 
 Poor investment performance of our products could reduce the level of our AUM or affect our sales, and negatively impact our revenues and income. 
 Our investment performance, along with achieving and maintaining superior distribution and client service, is critical to the success of our business. Strong investment performance often stimulates sales of our products. Poor investment performance as compared to third-party benchmarks or competitive products has led, and could in the future lead, to a decrease in sales of our products and stimulate redemptions from existing products, generally lowering the overall level of AUM and reducing the management fees we earn. We can provide no assurance that past or present investment performance in our products will be indicative of future performance. If we fail, or appear to fail, to address successfully and promptly the underlying causes of poor investment performance, our future business prospects would likely be negatively affected. 
 Harm to our reputation may negatively impact our revenues and income. 
 Our reputation is critical to the success of our business. We believe that our brand names have been, and continue to be, well received both in our industry and with our clients, reflecting the fact that our brands, like our business, are based in part on trust and confidence. If our brands or reputation are harmed, existing clients may reduce amounts held in, or withdraw entirely from, our products, or our clients and products may terminate their management agreements with us, 
 
 18 

Table of Contents 

which could reduce the amount of our AUM and cause us to suffer a corresponding loss in our revenues and income. In addition, reputational harm may prevent us from attracting new clients or developing new business. Moreover, ESG topics and activities have been the subject of increased focus by certain investors and regulators in the asset management industry, and any inability to meet applicable requirements or expectations may adversely impact our reputation and business. 
 GLOBAL OPERATIONAL RISKS 
 Our completed acquisition of Legg Mason, Inc. remains subject to integration risks. 
 On July 31, 2020, we completed our acquisition of Legg Mason, Inc. pursuant to the terms and conditions of an agreement and plan of merger, and Legg Mason became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Franklin. Important ongoing integration-related risks related to our completed acquisition of Legg Mason include the risks that the anticipated benefits of the transaction, including the realization of revenue, tax benefits, financial benefits or returns and expense and other synergies, may not be fully realized, or may take longer to realize than expected, and that the integration may cost more than expected. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic-related risks may result in unanticipated regulatory, planning and/or operational delays that may adversely impact the anticipated timeline and achievement of our ongoing integration goals. The ongoing integration of Legg Mason is a time-consuming and expensive process that, without adequate planning and effective and timely implementation, could significantly disrupt our business. Our failure to meet the challenges involved in continuing to integrate the operations of Legg Mason or to otherwise realize any of the anticipated benefits of the acquisition could adversely impair our business and operations as noted above. 
 Our business operations are complex and a failure to perform operational tasks properly or comply with applicable regulatory requirements could have an adverse effect on our revenues and income. 
 Through our subsidiaries, we provide investment management and related services to investors globally. In order to be competitive and comply with our agreements, we must properly perform our fund and portfolio administration and related responsibilities, including portfolio recordkeeping and accounting, security pricing, corporate actions, investment restrictions compliance, daily net asset value computations, account reconciliations, and required distributions to fund shareholders. Many of our operations are complex and dependent on our ability to process and monitor a large number of transactions effectively, which may occur across numerous markets and currencies at high volumes and frequencies. Although we expend considerable resources on internal controls, supervision, technology and training in an effort to ensure that such transactions do not violate applicable guidelines, rules and regulations or adversely affect our clients, counterparties or us, our operations are ultimately dependent on our personnel, as well as others involved in our business, such as third-party vendors, providers and other intermediaries, and subject to potential human errors. Our personnel and others involved in our business may, from time to time, make mistakes that are not always immediately detected, which may disrupt our operations, cause losses, lead to regulatory fines or sanctions, litigation, or otherwise damage our reputation. In addition, any misrepresentation of our services and products in advertising materials, public relations information, social media or other external communications could also adversely affect our reputation and business prospects. Our investment management fees, which represent the majority of our revenues, are dependent on fees earned under investment management agreements that we have with our products and clients. Our revenues could be adversely affected if such agreements representing a significant portion of our AUM are terminated. Further, certain of our subsidiaries may act as general partner for various investment partnerships, which may subject them to liability for the partnerships liabilities. If we fail to perform and monitor our operations properly, our business could suffer and our revenues and income could be adversely affected. 
 Failure to establish adequate controls and risk management policies, or the circumvention of controls and policies, could have an adverse effect on our global operations, reputation and financial position. 
 Although we have adopted risk management, operational and financial controls and compliance policies, procedures and programs that are subject to regular review and update, we cannot ensure that these measures will enable us effectively to identify and manage internal and external risks including those related to fraudulent activity and dishonesty. We are subject to the risk that our personnel, contractors, vendors and other third parties may deliberately or recklessly circumvent or violate our controls to commit fraud against our business, products and/or client accounts, pay or solicit bribes, or otherwise act in ways inconsistent with our controls, policies, workplace culture and business principles. Continued attempts to circumvent our policies and controls or repeated incidents involving violation of controls and policies, fraud or conflicts of interests could negatively impact our business and reputation and result in adverse publicity, regulatory investigations and actions, legal proceedings and losses and adversely affect our operations, reputation, AUM and financial results.

We face risks, and corresponding potential costs and expenses, associated with conducting operations and growing our business in numerous countries. 
 We sell our products and offer our strategies and investment management and related services in many different regulatory jurisdictions around the world, and intend to continue to expand our operations internationally. As we do so, we will continue to face challenges to the adequacy of our resources, procedures and controls to operate our business consistently and effectively. In order to remain competitive, we must be proactive and prepared to implement necessary resources when growth opportunities present themselves, whether as a result of a business acquisition or rapidly increasing business activities in particular markets or regions. Local regulatory environments may vary widely in terms of scope, adequacy and sophistication. Similarly, local distributors, and their policies and practices as well as financial viability, may vary widely and they may be inconsistent or less developed or mature than other more internationally focused distributors. Growth of our international operations has involved and may continue to involve near-term increases in expenses, as well as additional capital costs, such as information systems and technology costs, and costs related to compliance with particular regulatory or other local requirements or needs. Local requirements or needs also may place additional demands on sales and compliance personnel and resources, such as meeting local language requirements, while also integrating personnel into an organization with a single operating language. Finding, hiring and retaining additional, well-qualified personnel and crafting and adopting policies, procedures and controls to address local or regional requirements remain challenges as we expand our operations internationally. 
 Moreover, regulators in non-U.S. jurisdictions could also change their policies or laws in a manner that might restrict or otherwise impede our ability to distribute or authorize products or maintain their authorizations in their respective markets. Any of these local requirements, activities or needs could increase the costs and expenses we incur in a specific jurisdiction without any corresponding increase in revenues and income from operating in the jurisdiction. Certain laws and regulations both inside and outside the U.S. have extraterritorial application. This may lead to duplicative or conflicting legal or regulatory burdens and additional costs and risks. 
 Our focus on international markets as a source of investments and sales of our products subjects us to increased exchange rate and market-specific political, economic or other risks that may adversely impact our revenues and income generated overseas. 
 While we maintain a significant portion of our operations in the U.S., we also provide services and earn revenues in Asia-Pacific; Europe, Middle East and Africa; Latin America; and Canada. As a result, we are subject to foreign currency exchange risk through our non-U.S. operations. Fluctuations in the exchange rates to the U.S. dollar have affected, and may in the future affect, our financial results from one period to the next. While we have taken steps to reduce our exposure to foreign exchange risk, for example, by denominating a significant amount of our transactions in U.S. dollars, our situation may change in the future. Appreciation of the U.S. dollar could in the future moderate revenues from managing our products internationally, or could affect relative investment performance of certain of our products invested in non-U.S. securities. In addition, we have risk associated with the foreign exchange revaluation of U.S. dollar balances held by certain non-U.S. subsidiaries for which the local currency is the functional currency. Separately, management fees that we earn tend to be higher in connection with non-U.S. AUM than with U.S. AUM. Consequently, downturns in international markets have in the past had, and could in the future have, a significant effect on our revenues and income. Moreover, our emerging market portfolios and revenues derived from managing these portfolios are subject to significant risks of loss from financial, economic, political and diplomatic developments, currency fluctuations, social instability, changes in governmental policies, expropriation, nationalization, asset confiscation and changes in legislation related to non-U.S. ownership. International trading markets, particularly in some emerging market countries, are often smaller, less liquid, less regulated and significantly more volatile than those in the U.S. Any ongoing and future business, economic, political or social unrest affecting these markets, in addition to any direct consequences such unrest may have on our personnel and facilities located in the affected area, also may have a lasting impact on the long-term investment climate in these and other areas and, as a result, our AUM and the corresponding revenues and income that we generate from them may be negatively affected.

COMPETITION AND DISTRIBUTION RISKS 
 We may review and pursue strategic transactions that could pose risks to our business. 
 As part of our business strategy, we regularly consider, and have discussions with respect to, potential strategic transactions, including acquisitions, dispositions, consolidations, joint ventures or similar transactions, some of which may be deemed material. There can be no assurance that we will find suitable candidates for strategic transactions at acceptable prices, have sufficient capital resources to accomplish our strategy, or be successful in entering into agreements for desired transactions. In addition, such transactions typically involve a number of risks and present financial, managerial and operational challenges. Acquisitions and related transactions pose the risk that any business we acquire may result in the loss of clients, customers or personnel or could underperform relative to expectations. We also may not realize the anticipated benefits of an acquisition, including with respect to revenue, tax benefits, financial benefits or returns, and expense and other synergies. We could also experience financial or other setbacks if transactions encounter unanticipated problems, including problems related to execution or integration. Entries into material transactions typically are announced publicly even though they may remain subject to numerous closing conditions, contingencies and approvals, and there is no assurance that any announced transaction will actually be consummated. Future transactions also may further increase our leverage or, if we issue equity securities to pay for acquisitions, dilute the holdings of our existing stockholders. 
 In addition, from time to time, we enter into joint ventures or take minority stakes in companies in which we typically do not have control. These investments may involve risks, including the risk that the controlling stakeholder or joint venture partner may have business interests, strategies or goals that are inconsistent with ours. The business decisions or other actions or omissions of the controlling stakeholder, joint venture partner or the entity itself may result in liability to us or harm to our reputation, or adversely affect the value of our investment in the entity. 
 Failure to properly address the increased transformative pressures affecting the asset management industry could negatively impact our business. 
 The asset management industry is facing transformative pressures and trends from a variety of different sources including increased fee pressure; a continued shift away from actively managed core equities and fixed income strategies towards alternative, passive and smart beta strategies; increased demands from clients and distributors for client engagement and services; a trend towards institutions developing fewer relationships and partners and reducing the number of investment managers they work with; increased regulatory activity and scrutiny of many aspects of the asset management industry, including ESG practices and related matters, transparency/unbundling of fees, inducements, conflicts of interest, capital, liquidity, solvency, leverage, operational risk management, controls and compensation; addressing the key emerging markets in the world, such as China and India, which often have populations with different needs, preferences and horizons than the more developed U.S. and European markets; and advances in technology and increasing client interest in interacting digitally with their investment portfolios. As a result of the trends and pressures discussed above, the asset management industry is facing an increased level of disruption. If we are unable to adapt our strategy and business to address adequately these trends and pressures, we may be unable to meet client needs satisfactorily, our competitive position may weaken, and our business results and operations may be adversely affected. 
 Strong competition from numerous and sometimes larger companies with competing offerings and products could limit or reduce sales of our products, potentially resulting in a decline in our market share, revenues and income. 
 We compete with numerous investment management companies, securities brokerage and investment banking firms, insurance companies, banks and other financial institutions. Our products also compete with products offered by these competitors, as well as with real estate investment trusts, hedge funds and other products. The periodic establishment of new investment management companies and other competitors increases the competition that we face. At the same time, consolidation in the financial services industry has created stronger competitors with greater financial resources and broader distribution channels than our own. Competition is based on various factors, including, among others, business reputation, investment performance, product mix and offerings, ESG strategies and considerations, service quality and innovation, distribution relationships, and fees charged. Further, although we may offer certain types of ETFs, to the extent that there is a trend among existing or potential clients in favor of lower-fee index and other ETFs, it may favor our competitors who may offer such products that are more established or on a larger scale than we do. Additionally, competing securities broker-dealers and banks, upon which we rely to distribute and sell certain of our funds and other products, also may sell their own proprietary funds and products, which could limit the distribution of our products. To the extent that existing or potential clients, including securities broker-dealers, decide to invest in or distribute the products of our competitors, the sales of our products as well as our market share, revenues and income could decline. Our ability to 
 
 21 

Table of Contents 

attract and retain AUM is also dependent on the relative investment performance of our products, offering a mix of products and strategies that meets investor demands, and our ability to maintain our investment management fees and pricing structure at competitive levels. 
 Increasing competition and other changes in the third-party distribution and sales channels on which we depend could reduce our revenues and income and hinder our growth. 
 We primarily derive our fund sales through third-party broker-dealers, banks, investment advisers and other financial intermediaries. Because we rely on third-party distribution and sales channels to sell our products, we do not control the ultimate investment recommendations given by them to clients. Increasing competition for these distribution and sales channels, and regulatory changes and initiatives, have caused our distribution costs to rise and could cause further cost increases in the future, or could otherwise negatively impact the distribution of our products. Higher distribution costs lower our revenues and income, and consolidations in the broker-dealer or banking industries could also adversely impact our revenues and income. A failure to maintain our third-party distribution and sales channels, or a failure to maintain strong business relationships with our distributors and other intermediaries, may impair our distribution and sales operations. Any inability to access and successfully sell our products to clients through such third-party channels could have a negative effect on our level of AUM and adversely impact our business. 
 Moreover, we can provide no assurance that we will continue to have access to the third-party financial intermediaries that currently distribute our products, or that we will continue to have the opportunity to offer all or some of our existing products through them. If several of the major financial advisers that distribute our products were to cease operations or limit or otherwise end the distribution of our products, it could have a significant adverse impact on our revenues and income. 
 Further, the standards of conduct and disclosure and reporting requirements, with respect to fees, products, services and possible conflicts of interest, applicable to broker-dealers and other financial intermediaries in the U.S., remain subject to change and enhancement pursuant to business and regulatory developments and requirements, including with respect to investor suitability obligations, enhanced investor protections for retail customers, and increased compliance requirements. 
 In addition, Canada, the U.K., the Netherlands and the EU, through MiFID II, have adopted regimes that ban, or may limit, the payment of commissions and other inducements to intermediaries in relation to certain sales to retail customers in those jurisdictions, and similar regimes are under consideration in several other jurisdictions. Depending on their exact terms, such regimes may result in existing flows of business moving to less profitable channels or even to competitors providing substitutable products outside the regime. Arrangements with non-independent advisers will also be affected as narrower rules related to the requirement that commissions reflect an enhancement of the service to customers come into effect, along with a prescriptive list of permissible non-monetary benefits. The interpretation of the inducements rules has also resulted in major changes to how fund managers, including us, finance investment research with many firms, by opting to pay for third-party investment research for client accounts covered by MiFID II. 
 THIRD-PARTY RISKS 
 Any failure of our third-party providers to fulfill their obligations, or our failure to maintain good relationships with our providers, could adversely impact our business. 
 We currently, and may in the future, depend on a number of third-party providers to support various operational, technology, administrative, market data, distribution, and other business needs of our company. In addition, we may, from time to time, transfer vendor contracts and services from one provider to another. If our third-party providers fail to deliver required services on a timely basis, or if we experience other negative service quality or relationship issues with our providers, we may be exposed to significant costs and/or operational difficulties, and our ability to conduct and grow our business may be impaired. In addition, we outsource certain administration and other services for our funds to third-party providers. Such administrative and functional changes are costly and complex, and may expose us to heightened operational risks. Any failure to mitigate such risks could result in reputational harm to us, as well as financial losses to us and our clients. The failure of any key provider or vendor to fulfill its obligations to us could result in outcomes inconsistent with our or our clients objectives and requirements, result in legal liability and regulatory issues for us, and otherwise adversely impact us. 
 
 22 

Table of Contents 

We may be adversely affected if any of our third-party providers is subject to a successful cyber or security attack. 
 Due to our interconnectivity with third-party vendors, advisors, central agents, exchanges, clearing organizations and other financial institutions, we may be adversely affected if any of them is subject to a successful cyber attack or other privacy or information security event, including those arising due to the use of mobile technology or a third-party cloud environment. Most of the software applications that we use in our business are licensed from, and supported, upgraded and maintained by, third-party vendors. Our third-party applications include enterprise cloud storage and cloud computing application services provided and maintained by third-party vendors. Any breach, suspension or termination of certain of these licenses or the related support, upgrades and maintenance could cause temporary system delays or interruption that could adversely impact our business. Our third-party applications may include confidential and proprietary data provided by vendors and by us, including personal employee and/or client data. 
 TECHNOLOGY AND SECURITY RISKS 
 Our ability to manage and grow our business successfully can be impeded by systems and other technological limitations. 
 Our continued success in effectively managing and growing our business depends on our ability to integrate our varied accounting, financial, information, and operational systems on a global basis. Moreover, adapting or developing the existing technology systems we use to meet our internal needs, as well as client needs, industry demands and new regulatory requirements, is also critical for our business. The introduction of new technologies presents new challenges to us. On an ongoing basis, we need to upgrade and improve our technology, including our data processing, financial, accounting, shareholder servicing and trading systems. Further, we also must be proactive and prepared to implement new technology when growth opportunities present themselves, whether as a result of a business acquisition or rapidly increasing business activities in particular markets or regions. These needs could present operational issues or require significant capital spending, and may require us to reevaluate the current value and/or expected useful lives of the technology we use, which could negatively impact our results of operations. In addition, technology is subject to rapid advancements and changes and our competitors may, from time to time, implement newer technologies or more advanced platforms for their services and products, including digital advisers and other advanced electronic systems, which could adversely affect our business if we are unable to remain competitive. 
 Any significant limitation, failure or security breach of our information and cyber security infrastructure, software applications, technology or other systems that are critical to our operations could disrupt our business and harm our operations and reputation. 
 We are highly dependent upon the use of various proprietary and third-party information and security technology, software applications and other technology systems to operate our business. We are also dependent on the continuity and effectiveness of our information and cyber security infrastructure, management oversight and reporting framework, policies, procedures and capabilities to protect our computer and telecommunications systems and the data that reside on or are transmitted through them and contracted third-party systems. We use technology on a daily basis in our business to, among other things, support our business continuity and operations, process and transmit confidential communications, store and maintain data, obtain securities pricing information, process client transactions, and provide reports and other customer services to our clients. Any disruptions, inaccuracies, delays, theft, systems failures, data security or privacy breaches, cyber attacks or cyber-related fraud, or other security breaches in these and other processes could subject us to significant client dissatisfaction and losses and damage our reputation. We have been, and expect to continue to be, the subject of these types of risks, breaches and/or attacks, as well as attempts to co-opt our brand. Although we take protective measures, including measures to secure and protect information through system security technology and our internal security procedures, we can provide no assurance that any of these measures will prove effective or comply with evolving information security standards. The technology systems we use remain vulnerable to denial of service attacks, unauthorized access, computer viruses, potential human errors and other events and circumstances that may have a security impact, such as an external or internal hacker attack by one or more cyber criminals (including through the use of phishing attacks, malware, ransomware and other methods and activities maliciously designed to obtain and exploit confidential information and to cause system and service disruption and other damage) or our personnel or vendors inadvertently or recklessly causing us to release confidential information, which could materially harm our operations and reputation. 
 Potential system disruptions, failures or breaches of the technology we use or the security infrastructure we rely upon, including the third-party applications we use, could result in: (i) material financial loss or costs, (ii) delays in clients ability to access account information or in our ability to process transactions, (iii) the unauthorized disclosure or modification of sensitive or confidential client and business information, (iv) loss of valuable information, (v) breach of 
 
 23 

Table of Contents 

client and vendor contracts, (vi) liability for stolen assets, information or identity, (vii) remediation costs to repair damage caused by the failure or breach, (viii) additional security and organizational costs to mitigate against future incidents, (ix) reputational harm, (x) loss of confidence in our business and products, (xi) liability for failure to review and disclose applicable incidents or provide relevant updated disclosure properly and timely, (xii) regulatory investigations or actions, and/or (xiii) legal claims, litigation, and liability costs, any one or more of which may be material. Moreover, loss or unauthorized disclosure or transfer of confidential and proprietary data or confidential customer identification information could further harm our reputation and subject us to liability under laws that protect confidential data and personal information, resulting in increased costs or a decline in our revenues or common stock price. Further, although we take precautions to password protect and encrypt our laptops and sensitive information on our other mobile electronic devices, if such devices are stolen, misplaced or left unattended, they may become vulnerable to hacking or other unauthorized use, creating a possible security risk, which may require us to incur additional administrative costs and/or take remedial actions. In addition, failure to manage and operate properly the data centers and third-party cloud storage and computing application services we use could have an adverse impact on our business. Although we have in place certain disaster recovery plans, we may experience system delays and interruptions as a result of natural disasters, power failures, acts of war, and third-party failures. 
 Our inability to recover successfully, should we experience a disaster or other business continuity problem, could cause material financial loss, regulatory actions, legal liability, and/or reputational harm. 
 Should we experience a local or regional disaster or other business continuity problem, such as an earthquake, hurricane, tsunami, terrorist attack, public health crisis, pandemic or other natural or man-made disaster, our continued success will depend, in part, on the safety and availability of our personnel, our office facilities and infrastructure, and the proper functioning of our technology, computer, telecommunication and other systems and operations that are critical to our business. See Pandemic-Related Risks above for risks relating to COVID-19. While our operational size, the diversity of locations from which we operate, and our various back-up systems provide us with an advantage, should we experience a local or regional disaster or other business continuity event, we could still experience operational challenges, in particular depending upon how such a local or regional event may affect our personnel across our operations or with regard to particular aspects of our operations, such as key executives or personnel in our technology groups. Moreover, as we grow our operations in new geographic regions, the potential for particular types of natural or man-made disasters, political, economic or infrastructure instabilities, information, technology or security limitations or breaches, or other country- or region-specific business continuity risks increases. Past disaster recovery efforts have demonstrated that even seemingly localized events may require broader disaster recovery efforts throughout our operations and, consequently, we regularly assess and take steps to improve upon our existing business continuity plans. However, a disaster on a significant scale or affecting certain of our key operating areas within or across regions, or our inability to recover successfully following a disaster or other business continuity problem, could adversely impact our business and operations. 
 HUMAN CAPITAL RISKS 
 We depend on key personnel and our financial performance could be negatively affected by the loss of their services. 
 The success of our business will continue to depend upon our key personnel, including our portfolio managers, investment analysts, investment advisers, sales and management personnel and other professionals as well as our executive officers and business unit heads. Competition for qualified, motivated, and highly-skilled executives, professionals and other key personnel in the investment management industry remains significant. Our success depends to a substantial degree upon our ability to find, attract, retain and motivate qualified individuals, including through competitive compensation packages, and upon the continued contributions of these people. Global and/or local laws and regulations could impose restrictions on compensation paid by financial institutions, which could restrict our ability to compete effectively for qualified professionals. As our business develops, we may need to increase the number of individuals that we employ. Moreover, in order to retain certain key personnel, we may be required to increase compensation to such individuals and increase our key management succession planning, resulting in additional expense without a corresponding increase in potential revenues. There is no assurance that we will be successful in finding, attracting and retaining qualified individuals, and the departure of key investment personnel, in particular, could cause us to lose clients, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and business prospects. In addition, due to the global nature of our business, our key personnel may, from time to time, have reasons to travel to regions susceptible to higher risk of civil unrest, organized crime or terrorism, and we may be unable to ensure the safety of our personnel traveling to such regions.

CASH MANAGEMENT RISKS 
 Our ability to meet cash needs depends upon certain factors, including the market value of our assets, our operating cash flows and our perceived creditworthiness. 
 If we are unable to obtain cash, financing or access to the capital markets in a timely manner, we may be forced to incur unanticipated costs or revise our business plans, and our business could be adversely impacted. Further, our access to the capital markets depends significantly on our credit ratings. A reduction in our long- or short-term credit ratings could increase our borrowing costs and limit our access to the capital markets. Volatility in the global financing markets also may impact our ability to access the capital markets should we seek to do so, and may have an adverse effect on investors willingness to purchase our securities, interest rates, credit spreads and/or the valuation levels of equity markets. 
 We are dependent on the earnings of our subsidiaries. 
 Substantially all of our operations are conducted through our subsidiaries. As a result, our cash flow and our ability to fund operations are dependent upon the earnings of our subsidiaries and the distribution of earnings, loans or other payments by our subsidiaries. Our subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and have no obligation to fund our payment obligations, whether by dividends, distributions, loans or other payments. Any payments to us by our subsidiaries could be subject to statutory or contractual restrictions and are contingent upon our subsidiaries earnings and business considerations. Certain of our subsidiaries are subject to regulatory restrictions that may limit their ability to transfer assets to their parent companies. Our financial condition could be adversely affected if certain of our subsidiaries are unable to distribute assets to us. 
 LEGAL AND REGULATORY RISKS 
 For a more extensive discussion of certain laws, regulations (including certain pending regulatory reforms) and regulators to which we are subject, as well as certain defined terms referenced below, see Item 1 Business Regulation in Part I of this Annual Report. 
 We are subject to extensive, complex, overlapping and frequently changing rules, regulations, policies, and legal interpretations. 
 There is uncertainty associated with the regulatory and compliance environments in which we operate. Our business is subject to extensive and complex, overlapping and/or conflicting, and frequently changing and increasing rules, regulations, policies and legal interpretations, around the world. Political and electoral changes, developments and conflicts have in the past introduced, and may in the future introduce, additional uncertainty. Our regulatory and compliance obligations impose significant operational and cost burdens on us and cover a broad range of requirements related to financial reporting and other disclosure matters, securities and other financial instruments, investment and advisory matters, accounting, tax, compensation, ethics, intellectual property, data protection, privacy, sanctions programs, and escheatment requirements. We may be adversely affected by a failure to comply with applicable laws, regulations and changes in the countries in which we operate. 
 We may be adversely affected as a result of new or revised legislation or regulations or by changes in the interpretation of existing laws and regulations, in the U.S. and other jurisdictions. 
 The laws and regulations applicable to our business generally involve restrictions and requirements in connection with a variety of technical, specialized, and expanding matters and concerns. Over the years, the U.S. federal corporate governance and securities laws, and laws in other jurisdictions, have been augmented substantially and made significantly more complex by various legislation. As we continue to address our legal and regulatory requirements or focus on meeting new or expanded requirements, we may need to continue to expend a substantial amount of additional time, costs and resources. Regulatory reforms may add further complexity to our business and operations and could require us to alter our investment management services and related activities, which could be costly, impede our growth and adversely impact our AUM, revenues and income. Regulatory reforms also may impact our clients, which could cause them to change their investment strategies or allocations in a manner adverse to our business. Certain key regulatory reforms in the U.S. and other jurisdictions that may impact or relate to our business, and may cause us to incur additional obligations, include regulatory matters related to systemically important financial institutions, derivatives and other financial products, privacy and data protection, retail and other investor protections, ESG topics and disclosure, and other asset management disclosure and compliance requirements. The impacts of these and other regulatory reforms on us, now and in the future, could be significant. We expect that the regulatory requirements and developments applicable to us will cause us to continue to incur 
 
 25 

Table of Contents 

additional compliance and administrative burdens and costs. Any inability to meet applicable requirements within the required timeframes may subject us to sanctions or other restrictions by governments and/or regulators that could adversely impact our broader business objectives. 
 Global regulatory and legislative actions and reforms have made compliance in the regulatory environment in which we operate more costly and future actions and reforms could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations. 
 As in the U.S., regulatory and legislative actions outside the U.S. have been augmented substantially and made more complex by measures such as the EU s Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive and MiFID II. Further, ongoing changes in the EU s regulatory framework applicable to our business, including changes related to Brexit and any other changes in the composition of the EU s member states, may add further complexity to our global risks and operations. Moreover, the adoption of new laws, regulations or standards and changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws, regulations or standards have directly affected, and will continue to affect, our business. With new laws and changes in interpretation of existing requirements, the associated time we must dedicate to and related costs we must incur in meeting the regulatory complexities of our business have increased. We may be required to continue to invest significant additional management time and resources to address new and changing regulations pursuant to MiFID II and other laws. For example, MiFID II requires the unbundling of research and execution charges for trading. Outlays associated with meeting regulatory complexities have also increased as we expand our business into new jurisdictions. 
 The EU s GDPR strengthened and unified data protection rules for individuals within the EU and addresses export of personal data outside the EU. The failure to comply properly with GDPR rules on a timely basis and to maintain ongoing compliance with such rules may subject us to enforcement proceedings and significant fines and costs. For example, a failure to comply with GDPR could result in fines up to 20 million Euros or 4 of our annual global revenues, whichever is higher. 
 Compliance activities to address these and other new legal requirements have required, and will continue to require, us to expend additional time and resources, and, consequently, we are incurring increased costs of doing business, which potentially negatively impacts our profitability and future financial results. Finally, any further regulatory and legislative actions and reforms affecting the investment management industry, including compliance initiatives, may negatively impact revenues by increasing our costs of accessing or operating in financial markets or by making certain investment offerings less favorable to our clients. 
 Failure to comply with the laws, rules or regulations in any of the jurisdictions in which we operate could result in substantial harm to our reputation and results of operations. 
 As with all investment management companies, our activities are highly regulated in almost all countries in which we conduct business. Failure to comply with the applicable laws, rules, regulations, codes, directives, notices or guidelines in any of our jurisdictions could result in regulatory enforcement, civil liability, criminal liability and/or the imposition of a range of sanctions or orders against us, including, as applicable, monetary damages, injunctions, disgorgements, fines, penalties, cease and desist orders, censures, reprimands, and the revocation, cancellation, suspension or restriction of licenses, registration status or approvals held by us or our business in a jurisdiction or market, any of which could adversely affect our reputation and operations. Moreover, any potential accounting or reporting errors, whether financial or otherwise, if material, could damage our reputation and adversely affect our business. While management has focused attention and resources on our compliance policies, procedures and practices, the regulatory environments of the jurisdictions where we conduct our business, or where our products are organized or sold, are complex, uncertain and subject to change. Local regulatory environments may vary widely and place additional demands on our sales, investment, legal and compliance personnel. In recent years, the regulatory environments in which we operate have seen significant increased and evolving regulations, which have imposed and may continue to impose additional compliance and operational requirements and costs on us in the applicable jurisdictions. Regulators could also change their policies or laws in a manner that might restrict or otherwise impede our ability to offer our services and products in their respective markets, or we may be unable to keep up with, or adapt to, the ever changing, complex regulatory requirements in such jurisdictions or markets, which could further negatively impact our business. 
 Changes in tax laws or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. 
 We are subject to complex tax regimes, changing tax laws, income taxes, non-income-based taxes, and ongoing tax audits, in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken

and assess additional taxes. We regularly assess the likely outcomes of these audits in order to determine the appropriateness of our tax provision. However, there can be no assurance that we will accurately predict the outcomes of these audits and the actual outcomes could have a material impact on our financial condition. Changes in tax laws or rulings, including corporate tax rate increases, capital gains rate increases for fund investors and other tax rate increases impacting our clients and their willingness to invest in our products, may at times materially impact our financial condition. 
 Regulatory and governmental examinations and/or investigations, litigation and the legal risks associated with our business, could adversely impact our AUM, increase costs and negatively impact our profitability and/or our future financial results. 
 We operate in a highly regulated industry and routinely receive and respond to regulatory and governmental requests for documents or other information, subpoenas, examinations and, in some instances, investigations in connection with our business activities. Further, regulatory or governmental examinations or investigations that have been inactive could become active. In addition, we are named as a party in litigation in the ordinary course of business. Even if claims made against us are without merit, they can result in reputational harm and responding to such matters typically is an expensive process. Risks associated with legal liability often are difficult to assess or quantify and their existence and magnitude can remain unknown for significant periods of time. Regulatory enforcement and civil litigation matters can result in the imposition of a range of sanctions or orders against us, including, as applicable, monetary damages, injunctions, disgorgements, fines, penalties, cease and desist orders, censures, reprimands, and the revocation, cancellations, suspension or restriction of licenses, registration status or approvals held by us or our business. In addition, we may be obligated, and under our certificate of incorporation, bylaws and standard form of director indemnification agreement are obligated under certain conditions, or may choose, to indemnify directors, officers or personnel against liabilities and expenses they may incur in connection with such matters to the extent permitted under applicable law. Eventual financial exposures from and expenses incurred relating to any examinations, investigations, enforcement actions, litigation, and/or settlements could adversely impact our AUM, increase costs, and negatively impact our reputation, profitability, and revenue any of which could have a material negative impact on our financial results. For a discussion of certain legal proceedings and regulatory matters in which we are involved, see the Legal Proceedings section in Note 16 - Commitments and Contingencies in the notes to consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report. 
 Our contractual obligations may subject us to indemnification costs and liability to third parties. 
 In the ordinary course of business, we enter into contracts with third parties, including, without limitation, clients, vendors, and other service providers, that contain a variety of representations and warranties and that provide for indemnifications by us in certain circumstances. Pursuant to such contractual arrangements, we may be subject to indemnification costs and liability to third parties if, for example, we breach any material obligations under the agreements or agreed standards of care, or in the event such third parties have certain legal claims asserted against them. The terms of these indemnities vary from contract to contract, and future indemnification claims against us could negatively impact our financial condition. 
 Failure to protect our intellectual property may negatively impact our business. 
 Although we take steps to safeguard and protect our intellectual property, including but not limited to our trademarks, patents, copyrights and trade secrets, there can be no assurance that we will be able effectively to protect our rights. If our intellectual property rights were violated, we could be subject to economic and reputational harm that could negatively impact our business and competitiveness in the marketplace. Conversely, while we take efforts to avoid infringement of the intellectual property of third parties, if we are deemed to infringe on a third party s intellectual property rights it could expose us to litigation risks, license fees, liability and reputational harm.

 FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 The following discussion and analysis of the results of operations and financial condition of Franklin Resources, Inc. Franklin and its subsidiaries (collectively, the Company should be read in conjunction with the Forward-looking Statements disclosure set forth in Part I and the Risk Factors set forth in Item 1A of Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10 K (this Annual Report and in any more recent filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC ), each of which describe our risks, uncertainties and other important factors in more detail.

The level of our revenues depends largely on the level and relative mix of assets under management AUM ). As noted in the Risk Factors section set forth above in Item 1A of Part I of this Annual Report, the amount and mix of our AUM are subject to significant fluctuations that can negatively impact our revenues and income. The level of our revenues also depends on the fees charged for our services, which are based on contracts with our funds and customers, fund sales, and the number of shareholder transactions and accounts. These arrangements could change in the future. 
 As further noted in the Risk Factors section, the outbreak and spread of contagious diseases such as the coronavirus disease 2019 COVID-19 ), a highly transmissible and pathogenic disease, has adversely affected, and may continue to adversely affect, our business, financial condition and results of operations. Ongoing global health concerns, and uncertainty regarding the impact of COVID-19, could lead to further and/or increased volatility in global capital and credit markets, adversely affect our key executives and other personnel, clients, investors, providers, suppliers, lessees, and other third parties, and negatively impact our AUM, revenues, income, business and operations. As of the time of this filing, as the COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve, it is not possible to predict the full extent to which the pandemic may adversely impact our business, liquidity, capital resources, financial results and operations, which impacts will depend on numerous developing factors that remain uncertain and subject to change. 
 During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021 fiscal year 2021 ), the global equity markets continued to provide strong positive returns, reflecting among other things, an accelerated rollout of COVID-19 vaccines in most developed economies, government stimulus and other support in many countries, and a decline in U.S. 10-year treasury yields. The S P 500 Index and MSCI World Index increased 30.0 and 29.4 for the fiscal year. The global bond markets declined as the Bloomberg Barclays Global Aggregate Index decreased 0.9 for the fiscal year. 
 Our total AUM was 1,530.1 billion at September 30, 2021, which was 8 higher than at September 30, 2020 driven by 148.0 billion from net market change, distributions and other, and 3.5 billion from an acquisition, partially offset by 25.2 billion of long-term net outflows and 15.1 billion of cash management net outflows. Simple monthly average AUM average AUM increased 81 during fiscal year 2021, reflecting a full year of AUM from the acquisition of Legg Mason. 
 The business and regulatory environments in which we operate globally remain complex, uncertain and subject to change. We are subject to various laws, rules and regulations globally that impose restrictions, limitations, registration, reporting and disclosure requirements on our business, and add complexity to our global compliance operations. 
 Uncertainties regarding the global economy remain for the foreseeable future. As we continue to confront the challenges of the current economic and regulatory environments, we remain focused on the investment performance of our products and on providing high quality service to our clients. We continuously perform reviews of our business model. While we remain focused on expense management, we will also seek to attract, retain and develop personnel and invest strategically in systems and technology that will provide a secure and stable environment. We will continue to seek to protect and further our brand recognition while developing and maintaining broker-dealer and client relationships. The success of these and other strategies may be influenced by the factors discussed in the Risk Factors section.

 Operating income increased 826.1 million in fiscal year 2021 as a 51 increase in operating revenues was partially offset by a 45 increase in operating expenses. The increase in operating revenues and operating expenses was primarily due to the acquisition of Legg Mason. Net income attributable to Franklin Resources, Inc. increased 1,032.3 million due to the increase in operating income and higher other income, net, less the portion attributable to noncontrolling interests, partially offset by higher taxes on income. 
 The Company acquired Legg Mason effective July 31, 2020 , and the results of operations for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020 fiscal year 2020 include two months of Legg Mason s results. Operating income decreased 418.0 million in fiscal year 2020 due to a 2 decrease in operating revenues and a 7 increase in operating expenses which reflected higher levels of compensation and benefits expense, including acquisition-related retention costs, other acquisition-related expenses, and amortization and impairments of intangible assets and goodwill. Net income attributable to Franklin Resources, Inc. decreased 396.8 million primarily due to the decrease in operating income, as the impact of declines in market valuations amid global concerns about the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in net investment and other losses of 38.4 million, as compared to net gains of 141.4 million in the prior year, less the portion attributable to noncontrolling interests, which was largely offset by lower taxes on income. 
 Diluted earnings per share increased in fiscal year 2021 and decreased in fiscal year 2020, consistent with the changes in net income attributable to Franklin Resources, Inc. 
 Adjusted operating income increased 888.2 million in fiscal year 2021 primarily due to a 66 increase in investment management fees, partially offset by a 69 increase in compensation and benefits expense. The increase in investment management fees and compensation and benefits expenses was primarily due to the acquisition of Legg Mason. Adjusted net income increased 604.2 million primarily due to the increase in adjusted operating income, partially offset by lower other income, net, less the portion attributable to noncontrolling interests. 
 Adjusted operating income decreased 163.1 million in fiscal year 2020 primarily due to a 10 increase in compensation and benefits expense, excluding non-GAAP adjustments. Adjusted net income decreased 20.3 million primarily due to the decrease in adjusted operating income substantially offset by lower taxes on income, excluding the net income tax expense of non-GAAP adjustments.

 AUM increased 111.2 billion or 8 during fiscal year 2021 due to 148.0 billion of net market change, distributions and other, and 3.5 billion from an acquisition, partially offset by 25.2 billion of long-term net outflows and 15.1 billion of cash management net outflows. Net market change, distributions and other primarily consists of 176.3 billion of market appreciation, partially offset by 29.1 billion of long-term distributions. The market appreciation occurred in all asset classes, most significantly in the equity and multi-asset asset classes and reflected positive returns in global equity markets. 
 Long-term inflows increased 100 to 364.7 billion, as compared to the prior year, and long-term outflows increased 60 to 389.9 billion due to higher inflows and outflows in all long-term asset classes primarily due to the acquisition of Legg Mason. Long-term net outflows included outflows of 35.7 billion from sixteen institutional products, including two fixed income redemptions of 5.9 billion and 2.0 billion and two equity redemptions of 3.7 billion and 2.2 billion, 12.5 billion from seven fixed income funds, including 3.3 billion from five India credit funds that were non-management fee earning which are in the process of winding up, 5.4 billion from a 529 plan redemption, 3.9 billion from two equity funds and 3.1 billion from a multi-asset fund, partially offset by inflows of 12.3 billion in three fixed income funds, 6.7 billion in three institutional products, 3.7 billion in an equity fund, 3.1 billion in a multi-asset fund and 3.0 billion in two alternative funds.

 AUM increased 726.3 billion or 105 during fiscal year 2020 as 806.5 billion from acquisitions was partially offset by 61.6 billion of long-term net outflows, 9.9 billion of cash management net outflows and 8.7 billion of net market change, distributions and other. Acquisitions included 797.4 billion from the acquisition of Legg Mason and 9.1 billion from other acquisitions. Long-term inflows increased 4 to 182.4 billion due to higher inflows in all the long-term asset classes except multi-asset. Long-term outflows increased 18 to 244.0 billion due to higher outflows in all long-term asset classes except multi-asset, most significantly in fixed income products. Long-term net outflows included outflows of 27.6 billion from six fixed income funds, 7.3 billion from seven institutional products, 6.2 billion from three equity funds, and 3.6 billion from a multi-asset fund, partially offset by inflows of 6.0 billion in two equity funds, 4.0 billion in three fixed income funds, 2.0 billion in two institutional products and 1.3 billion in a private open-end product. Net market change, distributions and other primarily consists of 24.8 billion of long-term distributions, partially offset by 15.8 billion of market appreciation.

 Investment Performance Overview 
 A key driver of our overall success is the long-term investment performance of our investment products. A measure of the performance of these products is the percentage of AUM exceeding peer group medians and benchmarks. We compare the relative performance of our mutual funds against peers, and of our strategy composites against benchmarks. Higher long-term relative performance of our mutual fund AUM during fiscal year 2021 resulted in a significant increase from September 30, 2020 to the peer group comparison for the one-, three- and five-year periods. Approximately half of our mutual fund AUM and at least 69 of our strategy composite AUM exceeded the peer group median comparisons for all periods presented, primarily driven by the performance of our fixed income products.

 1 Mutual fund performance is sourced from Morningstar and measures the percent of ranked AUM in the top two quartiles versus peers. Total mutual fund AUM measured for the 1-, 3-, 5- and 10-year periods represents 42 , 42 , 41 and 39 of our total AUM as of September 30, 2021. 
 2 Strategy composite performance measures the percent of composite AUM beating its benchmark. The benchmark comparisons are based on each account s/composite s (strategy composites may include retail separately managed accounts and mutual fund assets managed as part of the same strategy) return as compared to a market index that has been selected to be generally consistent with the asset class of the account/composite. Total strategy composite AUM measured for the 1-, 3-, 5- and 10-year periods represents 69 , 68 , 68 and 62 of our total AUM as of September 30, 2021. 
 3 Total mutual fund AUM includes performance of our multi-asset and alternative AUM, and total strategy composite AUM includes performance of our alternative AUM. Multi-asset and alternative AUM represent 10 and 9 of our total AUM at September 30, 2021. 
 Mutual fund performance data includes U.S. and cross-border domiciled mutual funds and exchange-traded funds, and excludes cash management and fund of funds. These results assume the reinvestment of dividends, are based on data available as of October 7, 2021 and are subject to revision. While we remain focused on achieving strong long-term performance, our future peer group and benchmarking rankings may vary from our past performance. 
 Past performance is not indicative of future results. For AUM included in institutional and retail separate accounts and investment funds managed in the same strategy as separate accounts, performance comparisons are based on gross-of-fee performance. For investment funds which are not managed in a separate account format, performance comparisons are based on net-of-fee performance. These performance comparisons do not reflect the actual performance of any specific separate account or investment fund; individual separate account and investment fund performance may differ.

OPERATING REVENUES 
 The table below presents the percentage change in each operating revenue category. 
 (in millions) 2021 vs. 2020 2020 vs. 2019 for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2021 2020 2019 Investment management fees 6,541.6 3,981.7 3,985.2 64 0 Sales and distribution fees 1,635.5 1,362.0 1,444.6 20 (6 Shareholder servicing fees 211.2 195.1 216.3 8 (10 Other 37.2 27.7 23.3 34 19 Total Operating Revenues 8,425.5 5,566.5 5,669.4 51 (2 
 The Legg Mason acquisition had a significant impact on operating revenues in fiscal year 2021; however, due to the continued integration of the combined businesses, it is no longer practicable to separately quantify the impact of the legacy Legg Mason business. 
 
 Investment Management Fees 
 Investment management fees are generally calculated under contractual arrangements with our investment products and the products for which we provide sub-advisory services as a percentage of AUM. Annual fee rates vary by asset class and type of services provided. Fee rates for products sold outside of the U.S. are generally higher than for U.S. products. 
 Investment management fees increased 2,559.9 million in fiscal year 2021 primarily due to the acquisition of Legg Mason, a 5 increase in average AUM and higher performance fees. The increase in average AUM occurred primarily in the equity and multi-asset asset classes, partially offset by decreases in the fixed income asset class. The increase occurred primarily in U.S. sales regions, partially offset by a decline in Asia-Pacific sales region. 
 Investment management fees decreased 3.5 million in fiscal year 2020 primarily due to a 7 decrease in average AUM, lower effective investment management fee rate and lower performance fees of the legacy Franklin business, largely offset by 427.6 million of revenue earned by Legg Mason subsequent to the acquisition. The decrease in average AUM of the legacy Franklin business occurred primarily in the fixed income and equity asset classes, partially offset by an increase in the alternative asset class, and across all sales regions except Europe, Middle East and Africa. 
 Our effective investment management fee rate excluding performance fees (investment management fees excluding performance fees divided by average AUM) was 41.8, 47.3 and 56.4 basis points for fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019. The rate decrease in fiscal year 2021 was primarily due to the Legg Mason acquisition, as Legg Mason generally had a lower overall effective fee rate due to a higher mix of institutional and fixed income AUM. 
 Performance-based investment management fees were 258.6 million, 44.0 million and 52.9 million for fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019. The increase in fiscal year 2021 was primarily due to the acquisition of Legg Mason as well as strong performance, while the decrease in fiscal year 2020 was primarily due to the lower performance fees earned from a private debt fund, separate accounts and a real estate fund, partially offset by 15.0 million of performance fees earned by Legg Mason subsequent to the acquisition.

U.S. industry asset-weighted average management fee rates were as follows:

 1 U.S. industry asset-weighted average management fee rates were calculated using information available from Lipper, a Refinitiv Company, as of September 30, 2021, 2020 and 2019 and include all U.S.-registered open-end funds and exchange traded funds that reported expense data to Lipper as of the funds most recent annual report date, and for which expenses were equal to or greater than zero. As defined by Lipper, management fees include fees from providing advisory and fund administration services. The averages combine retail and institutional funds data and include all share classes and distribution channels, without exception. Variable annuity and fund of fund products are not included. 
 2 The decreases in the average rate in fiscal years 2021 and 2020 reflect higher weightings of two large low-fee passive funds and lower weightings of two large higher-fee actively managed funds for fiscal year 2020. 
 3 The decreases in the average rate in fiscal years 2021 and 2020 reflect higher weightings of two large low-fee passive funds. 
 4 The increase in the average rate in fiscal year 2021 reflect higher weightings of one large actively managed fund and lower weightings of one large low-fee passive fund, while decrease in the average rate in fiscal year 2020 reflect higher weightings of one large low-fee passive fund. 
 The declines in U.S. industry average management fee rates for long-term asset classes generally reflect increased investor demand for lower-fee passive funds. Our actual effective investment management fee rates are generally higher than the U.S. industry average rates as we actively manage substantially all of our products and have a significant amount of international AUM, both of which generate higher fees. Our fiscal year 2021 effective fee rates in the U.S. generally decreased to a greater extent than the average industry rates due to the acquisition of Legg Mason, as Legg Mason generally had a lower overall effective fee rate due to a higher mix of institutional and fixed income AUM . 
 Our product offerings and global operations are diverse. As such, the impact of future changes in AUM on investment management fees will be affected by the relative mix of asset class, geographic region, distribution channel and investment vehicle of the assets. 
 
 Sales and Distribution Fees 
 Sales and distribution fees primarily consist of upfront sales commissions and ongoing distribution fees. Sales commissions are earned from the sale of certain classes of sponsored funds at the time of purchase commissionable sales and may be reduced or eliminated depending on the amount invested and the type of investor. Therefore, sales fees generally will change with the overall level of gross sales, the size of individual transactions, and the relative mix of sales between different share classes and types of investors. 
 Our sponsored mutual funds generally pay us distribution fees in return for sales, marketing and distribution efforts on their behalf. The majority of our U.S. mutual funds, with the exception of certain money market funds and certain other funds specifically designed for purchase through separately managed account programs, have adopted distribution plans under Rule 12b-1 (the Rule 12b-1 Plans promulgated under the Investment Company Act of 1940. The Rule 12b-1 Plans permit the funds to pay us for marketing, marketing support, advertising, printing and sales promotion services relating to the distribution of their shares, subject to the Rule 12b-1 Plans limitations on amounts based on daily average AUM. We earn distribution fees from our non-U.S. funds based on daily average AUM. 
 Contingent sales charges are earned from investor redemptions within a contracted period of time. Substantially all of these charges are levied on certain shares sold without a front-end sales charge, and vary with the mix of redemptions of these shares. 
 We pay substantially all of our sales and distribution fees to the financial advisers, broker-dealers and other intermediaries that sell our funds on our behalf. See the description of sales, distribution and marketing expenses below.

 Asset-based distribution fees increased 206.0 million in fiscal year 2021 primarily due to the acquisition of Legg Mason and 53.1 million from a 5 increase in the related average AUM, partially offset by 33.2 million from a higher mix of lower-fee U.S. assets. Asset-based distribution fees decreased 91.9 million in fiscal year 2020 primarily due to decreases of 79.2 million from a 7 decrease in the related average AUM and 38.6 million from a higher mix of lower-fee U.S. assets, partially offset by 35.3 million from fees earned by Legg Mason subsequent to the acquisition. 
 Sales-based fees increased 68.7 million in fiscal year 2021 primarily due to the acquisition of Legg Mason and 13.0 million from higher commissionable sales. Sales-based fees increased 1.9 million in fiscal year 2020 primarily due to increases of 9.8 million from fees earned by Legg Mason subsequent to the acquisition, 7.2 million from higher U.S. product commissionable sales and, 2.9 million from a higher mix of equity sales, which typically generate higher sales fees than fixed income products. The increases were substantially offset by a decrease of 18.7 million from lower non-U.S. product commissionable sales. 
 
 Shareholder Servicing Fees 
 Substantially all shareholder servicing fees are earned from our sponsored funds for providing transfer agency services, which include providing shareholder statements, transaction processing, customer service and tax reporting. These fees are primarily determined based on a percentage of AUM and either the number of transactions in shareholder accounts or the number of shareholder accounts, while fees from certain funds are based only on AUM. Shareholder servicing fees also include fund reimbursements of expenses incurred while providing transfer agency services. 
 Shareholder servicing fees increased 16.1 million in fiscal year 2021 primarily due to the acquisition of Legg Mason and higher levels of related AUM, partially offset by lower levels of transactions. Shareholder servicing fees decreased 21.2 million in fiscal year 2020 primarily due to lower levels of related AUM and transactions. 
 
 Other 
 Other revenue increased 9.5 million and 4.4 million in fiscal years 2021 and 2020 primarily due to higher miscellaneous fee revenues.

 Salaries, wages and benefits increased 363.8 million in fiscal year 2021, primarily due to the acquisition of Legg Mason. Salaries, wages and benefits increased 91.1 million in fiscal year 2020, primarily due to increases of 56.9 million from higher average staffing levels primarily resulting from acquisitions, 19.3 million for an annual salary increase that was effective December 1 of the fiscal year and 16.2 million related to other termination benefits, partially offset by a decrease of 5.9 million from favorable foreign currency impacts. 
 Variable compensation increased 793.4 million in fiscal year 2021, primarily due to the acquisition of Legg Mason, which includes 25.3 million from acquisition-related pass through performance fees. Variable compensation increased 66.7 million in fiscal year 2020, primarily due to increases of 67.7 million related to acquired firms bonus plans and 10.0 million related to private equity and other product performance fees, partially offset by decreases of 11.3 million related to unvested mutual fund awards and 9.6 million related to bonus expense primarily due to lower expectations of our annual performance. 
 Acquisition-related retention expenses decreased 32.1 million in fiscal year 2021 and increased 132.1 million in fiscal year 2020 primarily due to the acquisition of Legg Mason. 
 Special termination benefits primarily relate to workforce optimization initiatives related to the acquisition of Legg Mason in fiscal years 2021 and 2020, and voluntary separation and workforce reduction initiatives of 4.5 of our global workforce in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019 fiscal year 2019 ). 
 We expect to incur acquisition-related retention expenses of approximately 130 million during the fiscal year ending September 30, 2022 fiscal year 2022 ), and decreasing over the following two fiscal years by approximately 15 million and 25 million. At September 30, 2021, our global workforce had decreased to approximately 10,300 employees from approximately 11,800 at September 30, 2020.

We continue to place a high emphasis on our pay for performance philosophy. As such, any changes in the underlying performance of our investment products or changes in the composition of our incentive compensation offerings could have an impact on compensation and benefits expenses going forward. However, in order to attract and retain talented individuals, our level of compensation and benefit expenses may increase more quickly or decrease more slowly than our revenue. 
 
 Sales, Distribution and Marketing 
 Sales, distribution and marketing expenses primarily relate to services provided by financial advisers, broker-dealers and other intermediaries to our sponsored funds, including marketing support services. Substantially all distribution expenses are incurred from assets that generate distribution fees and are determined as a percentage of AUM. Substantially all sales expenses are incurred from the same commissionable sales transactions that generate sales fee revenues and are determined as a percentage of sales. Marketing support expenses are based on AUM, sales or a combination thereof. Also included is the amortization of deferred sales commissions related to upfront commissions on shares sold without a front-end sales charge. The deferred sales commissions are amortized over the periods in which commissions are generally recovered from related revenues.

 Asset-based expenses increased 345.7 million in fiscal year 2021 primarily due to the acquisition of Legg Mason and 59.7 million from a 5 increase in the related average AUM. Asset-based expenses decreased 107.0 million in fiscal year 2020 primarily due to decreases of 107.4 million from an 8 decrease in the related average AUM and 53.4 million from a higher mix of lower-fee U.S. assets, partially offset by a 58.6 million increase in expenses incurred by Legg Mason subsequent to the acquisition. Distribution expenses are generally not directly correlated with distribution fee revenues due to certain fee structures that do not provide full recovery of distribution costs. 
 Sales-based expenses increased 59.1 million in fiscal year 2021 primarily due to the acquisition of Legg Mason and 12.1 million from higher commissionable sales. Sales-based expenses decreased 4.0 million in fiscal year 2020 primarily due to a 20.3 million decrease from lower non-U.S. product commissionable sales, largely offset by an 8.6 million increase in expenses incurred by Legg Mason subsequent to the acquisition and a 7.5 million increase from higher U.S. product commissionable sales. U.S. products typically generate higher sales commissions than non-U.S. products. 
 
 Information Systems and Technology 
 Information systems and technology expenses increased 197.7 million in fiscal year 2021 primarily due to higher external data service and software costs and technology consulting as a result of the Legg Mason acquisition. Information systems and technology expenses increased 29.9 million in fiscal year 2020 primarily due to expenses of Legg Mason subsequent to closing of the acquisition. 
 
 Occupancy 
 Occupancy expenses increased 70.2 million and 14.3 million in fiscal years 2021 and 2020 primarily due to an increase in leased office space as a result of the Legg Mason acquisition.

Amortization of intangible assets 
 Amortization of intangible assets increased 178.0 million and 39.3 million in fiscal years 2021 and 2020 primarily related to the intangible assets recognized as part of the acquisition of Legg Mason. See Note 9 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets in the notes to consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report for information on definite-lived intangible assets. 
 
 General, Administrative and Other 
 General, administrative and other operating expenses primarily consist of professional fees, fund-related service fees payable to external parties, advertising and promotion, travel and entertainment, and other miscellaneous expenses. 
 General, administrative and other operating expenses increased 86.9 million in fiscal year 2021, primarily due to the acquisition of Legg Mason and 43.0 million of closed-end fund product launch costs. The increase was also due to increases of 35.0 million third-party fund administration and sub-advisory service fees and 12.9 million placement and platform fees. The increases were partially offset by 55.4 million prior year impairments of intangible assets and goodwill primarily related to assets recognized from the acquisitions of Benefit Street Partners, L.L.C. BSP and Onsa, Inc., (formally known as TokenVault, Inc). 
 General, administrative and other operating expenses increased 58.9 million in fiscal year 2020, primarily due to increases of 48.0 million in acquisition-related professional fees and 19.3 million of post-acquisition general and administrative expenses, both related to Legg Mason. Additionally, impairments of intangible assets and goodwill increased 42.1 million primarily related to assets recognized from the acquisitions of BSP and Onsa, Inc., (formally known as TokenVault, Inc.). The increases were partially offset by decreases of 24.6 million in travel and entertainment expenses and 13.8 million in advertising and promotion expenses, both primarily due to lower activity levels, and by a prior year litigation settlement. 
 
 OTHER INCOME (EXPENSES) 
 Other income (expenses) consisted of the following:

 Investment and other income (losses), net increased 303.1 million in fiscal year 2021 primarily due to income from equity method investees and gains on investments held by the Company, partially offset by a decrease in dividend income and losses on derivatives. Investment and other income (losses), net decreased 179.8 million in fiscal year 2020 primarily due to the impact of steep declines in market valuations on investment income, lower dividend and interest income, and foreign exchange losses, partially offset by an increase in rental income. 
 Equity method investees generated income of 154.3 million, as compared to losses of 98.1 million in the prior year. The current year reflects continued recovery in market valuations of investments held by various global equity funds. Losses from equity method investees increased 87.7 million in fiscal year 2020, primarily related to investments in two global equity funds.

Table of Contents 

Investments held by the Company generated net gains of 90.9 million, as compared to net losses of 16.8 million in the prior year, primarily from various nonconsolidated funds, and in the current year, assets invested for Legg Mason deferred compensation plans. 
 Dividend income decreased 40.1 million in fiscal year 2021 and 48.1 million in fiscal year 2020 primarily due to lower yields on money market funds. 
 Interest expense increased 52.0 million in fiscal year 2021 primarily due to interest expense recognized on debt of Legg Mason and on the senior unsecured unsubordinated notes issued during fiscal year 2021, partially offset by the redemption of the junior notes issued by Legg Mason. Interest expense increased 11.0 million in fiscal year 2020 primarily due to interest expense recognized on debt of Legg Mason subsequent to the acquisition. 
 Investment and other income of consolidated investment products, net consists of dividend and interest income and investment gains (losses) on investments held by CIPs. Expenses of consolidated investment products primarily consists of fund-related expenses, including professional fees and other administrative expenses, and interest expense. Significant portions of the investment and other income of consolidated investment products, net and expenses of consolidated investment products are offset in noncontrolling interests in our consolidated statements of income. 
 Investment and other income of consolidated investment products, net increased 350.9 million in fiscal year 2021 primarily due to net gains on investments held by various alternative funds. Investment and other income of consolidated investment products, net decreased 8.6 million in fiscal year 2020 primarily due to net losses on investments held by various alternative funds, partially offset by net gains from holdings of various equity funds and a U.S. fixed income fund and an increase in dividend and interest income of CIPs. 
 Expenses of consolidated investment products increased 1.8 million in fiscal year 2021 and 12.5 million in fiscal year 2020, primarily due to activity of the funds. 
 Our investments in sponsored funds include initial cash investments made in the course of launching mutual fund and other investment product offerings, as well as investments for other business reasons. The market conditions that impact our AUM similarly affect the investment income earned or losses incurred on our investments in sponsored funds. 
 Our cash, cash equivalents and investments portfolio by asset class and accounting classification at September 30, 2021, excluding third-party assets of CIPs, was as follows:

TAXES ON INCOME 
 Our effective income tax rate for fiscal year 2021 was 14.3 as compared to 22.7 in fiscal year 2020 and 26.8 in fiscal year 2019. The rate decrease in fiscal year 2021 was primarily due to the release of a tax reserve following the close of an IRS audit of the U.S. taxation of deemed foreign dividends Transition Tax for fiscal year 2018 and net income attributable to noncontrolling interests as compared to a net loss in the prior fiscal year. The rate decrease in fiscal year 2020 was primarily due to the prior-year reversal of the tax benefit included in the Transition Tax upon issuance of final regulations by the U.S. Department of Treasury for the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act Tax Act ), tax benefits from capital losses subsequent to the change in corporate tax structure of a foreign holding company to a U.S. branch, and a statutory rate reduction enacted in India in December 2019. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in the tax rate due to a lower mix of earnings in lower tax jurisdictions. Our effective income tax rate excluding the one-time impact of the Tax Act was 21.6 for fiscal year 2019. 
 Our effective income tax rate reflects the relative contributions of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate, which have varying tax rates. Changes in our pre-tax income mix, tax rates or tax legislation in such jurisdictions may affect our effective income tax rate and net income. 
 
 SUPPLEMENTAL NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES 
 As supplemental information, we are providing performance measures for adjusted operating income, adjusted operating margin, adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share, each of which is based on methodologies other than generally accepted accounting principles non-GAAP measures ). Management believes these non-GAAP measures are useful indicators of our financial performance and may be helpful to investors in evaluating our relative performance against industry peers as these measures exclude the impact of CIPs and mitigate the margin variability related to sales and distribution revenues and expenses across multiple distribution channels globally. These measures also exclude performance-based investment management fees which are fully passed through as compensation and benefits expense per the terms of a previous acquisition by Legg Mason and have no impact on net income. These non-GAAP measures also exclude acquisition-related expenses, certain items which management considers to be nonrecurring, unrealized investment gains and losses included in investment and other income (losses), net, and the related income tax effect of these adjustments, as applicable. These non-GAAP measures also exclude the impact on compensation and benefits expense from gains and losses on investments made to fund deferred compensation plans and on seed investments under certain historical revenue sharing arrangements, which is offset in investment and other income (losses), net. 
 Adjusted operating income, adjusted operating margin, adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share are defined below, followed by reconciliations of operating income, operating margin, net income attributable to Franklin Resources, Inc. and diluted earnings per share on a U.S. GAAP basis to these non-GAAP measures. Non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as substitutes for, any financial information prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. Additional reconciling items may be added in the future to these non-GAAP measures if deemed appropriate. 
 Adjusted Operating Income 
 We define adjusted operating income as operating income adjusted to exclude the following: 
 Elimination of operating revenues upon consolidation of investment products. 
 Acquisition-related retention compensation. 
 Impact on compensation and benefits expense from gains and losses on investments related to Legg Mason deferred compensation plans and seed investments, which is offset in investment and other income (losses), net. 
 Other acquisition-related expenses including professional fees, technology costs and fair value adjustments related to contingent consideration liabilities. 
 Amortization and impairment of intangible assets and goodwill. 
 Special termination benefits related to workforce optimization initiatives related to past acquisitions and specific initiatives announced by the Company.

Table of Contents 

Adjusted Operating Margin 
 We calculate adjusted operating margin as adjusted operating income divided by adjusted operating revenues. We define adjusted operating revenues as operating revenues adjusted to exclude the following: 
 Acquisition-related performance-based investment management fees which are passed through as compensation and benefits expense. 
 Sales and distribution fees and a portion of investment management fees allocated to cover sales, distribution and marketing expenses paid to the financial advisers and other intermediaries who sell our funds on our behalf. 
 Elimination of operating revenues upon consolidation of investment products. 
 Adjusted Net Income 
 We define adjusted net income as net income attributable to Franklin Resources, Inc. adjusted to exclude the following: 
 Activities of CIPs, including investment and other income (losses), net, and income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests, net of revenues eliminated upon consolidation of investment products. 
 Acquisition-related retention compensation. 
 Other acquisition-related expenses including professional fees, technology costs and fair value adjustments related to contingent consideration liabilities. 
 Amortization and impairment of intangible assets. 
 Impairment of goodwill and write off of noncontrolling interests related to the wind down of an acquired business. 
 Special termination benefits related to workforce optimization initiatives related to past acquisitions and specific initiatives announced by the Company. 
 Net gains or losses on investments related to Legg Mason deferred compensation plans which are not offset by compensation and benefits expense. 
 Unrealized investment gains and losses other than those that are offset by compensation and benefits expense. 
 Interest expense for amortization of Legg Mason debt premium from acquisition-date fair value adjustment. 
 Net income tax expense of the above adjustments based on the respective blended rates applicable to the adjustments. 
 Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share 
 We define adjusted diluted earnings per share as diluted earnings per share adjusted to exclude the per share impacts of the adjustments applied to net income in calculating adjusted net income. 
 In calculating adjusted operating income, adjusted operating margin, adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share, we adjust for activities of CIPs because the impact of consolidated products is not considered reflective of the underlying results of our operations. We adjust for acquisition-related retention compensation, other acquisition-related expenses, amortization and impairment of intangible assets and goodwill, the write-off of noncontrolling interests, and interest expense for amortization of the Legg Mason debt premium to facilitate comparability of our operating results with the results of other asset management firms. We adjust for special termination benefits related to workforce optimization initiatives related to past acquisitions and specific initiatives announced by the Company because these items are deemed nonrecurring. In calculating adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share, we adjust for unrealized investment gains and losses included in investment and other income (losses), net and net gains or losses on investments related to Legg Mason deferred compensation plans which are not offset by compensation and benefits expense because these items primarily relate to seed and strategic investments which have been and are generally expected to be held long term.

 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 Cash flows were as follows: 
 (in millions) for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2021 2020 2019 Operating cash flows 1,245.4 1,083.3 268.5 Investing cash flows (2,615.9) (4,061.9) (1,275.4) Financing cash flows 2,030.1 734.4 339.9 
 Net cash provided by operating activities increased in fiscal year 2021 primarily due to higher net income, a higher adjustment for amortization of intangible assets and increases in accrued compensation and benefits, partially offset by a lower change in investments, net, adjustments for gains of CIPs as compared to losses in the prior year, increases in receivables and other assets and income from investments in equity method investees as compared to losses in the prior year. Net cash used in investing activities decreased as compared to the prior year primarily due to lower cash paid for acquisitions, partially offset by net deconsolidation of CIPs as compared to net consolidation in the prior year, higher net purchases of investments by CLOs and net purchases of investments as compared to net liquidations in the prior year. Net cash provided by financing activities increased as compared to the prior year primarily due to proceeds from debt of CIPs, proceeds from issuance of debt and higher net subscriptions in CIPs by noncontrolling interests, partially offset by higher payments on debt by CIPs and debt.

Table of Contents 

Net cash provided by operating activities increased in fiscal year 2020 primarily due to lower net purchases of investments by CIPs, decreases in investments, net, decreases in receivables and other assets, and a smaller decline in taxes payable, partially offset by decreases in net income and decreases in accounts payable and accrued expenses. Net cash used in investing activities increased as compared to the prior year primarily due to higher cash paid for acquisitions, and net purchases of investments by CLOs, partially offset by net consolidation of CIPs as compared to net deconsolidation in the prior year, higher net liquidation of our investments as compared to the prior year, and lower net additions of property, plant and equipment. Net cash provided by financing activities, as compared to net cash used in the prior year, primarily resulted from proceeds from debt of CIPs and lower repurchases of stock, partially offset by lower net subscriptions in CIPs by noncontrolling interests and payments on debt by CIPs. 
 The assets and liabilities of CIPs attributable to third-party investors do not impact our liquidity and capital resources. We have no right to the CIPs assets, other than our direct equity investment in them and investment management and other fees earned from them. The debt holders of the CIPs have no recourse to our assets beyond the level of our direct investment, therefore we bear no other risks associated with the CIPs liabilities. Accordingly, the assets and liabilities of CIPs, other than our direct investments in them, are excluded from the amounts and discussion below. 
 Our liquid assets and debt consisted of the following: 
 (in millions) as of September 30, 2021 2020 2019 Assets Cash and cash equivalents 4,357.8 3,026.8 5,803.4 Receivables 1,300.4 1,114.8 740.0 Investments 1,042.2 982.2 2,029.4 Total Liquid Assets 6,700.4 5,123.8 8,572.8 Liability Debt 3,399.4 3,017.1 696.9 
 Liquidity 
 Liquid assets consist of cash and cash equivalents, receivables and certain investments. Cash and cash equivalents at September 30, 2021 primarily consist of deposits with financial institutions and money market funds. Liquid investments consist of investments in sponsored and other funds, direct investments in redeemable CIPs, other equity and debt securities, and time deposits with maturities greater than three months. 
 We utilize a significant portion of our liquid assets to satisfy operational and regulatory requirements and fund capital contributions to sponsored and other products. Certain of our subsidiaries are required by our internal policy or regulation to maintain minimum levels of cash and/or capital, and may be restricted in their ability to transfer cash to their parent companies. Liquid assets used to satisfy these purposes were 4,059.6 million at September 30, 2021 and 3,290.9 million at September 30, 2020, including 262.6 million and 316.6 million that was restricted by regulatory requirements. Should we require more capital than is available for use, we could elect to reduce the level of discretionary activities, such as share repurchases or investments in sponsored and other products, or we could raise capital through debt or equity issuance. These alternatives could result in increased interest expense, decreased dividend or interest income, or other dilution to our earnings. 
 Capital Resources 
 We believe that we can meet our present and reasonably foreseeable operating cash needs and future commitments through existing liquid assets, continuing cash flows from operations, the ability to issue debt or equity securities and borrowing capacity under our uncommitted commercial paper private placement program. 
 On September 15, 2021, we redeemed all of the outstanding 500.0 million 5.450 junior notes due in September 2056 issued by Legg Mason at the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest of 6.8 million.

Table of Contents 

On August 12, 2021, we completed the offering and sale of the 2.950 senior unsecured unsubordinated notes due 2051 with an aggregate principal amount of 350.0 million. 
 On March 15, 2021, we redeemed all of the outstanding 250.0 million 6.375 junior notes due in March 2056 issued by Legg Mason at the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest of 4.0 million. 
 On October 19, 2020, we completed the offering and sale of the 1.600 senior unsecured unsubordinated notes due 2030 with a principal amount of 750.0 million. On August 12, 2021, the Company issued an additional 100.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 1.600 senior notes due October 2030. The notes contain an optional redemption feature that allows us to redeem each series of notes prior to maturity in whole or in part at any time, at a make-whole redemption price. 
 Prior to fiscal year 2021, we issued senior unsecured unsubordinated notes for general corporate purposes, to redeem outstanding notes and to finance an acquisition. At September 30, 2021, 699.6 million of the notes issued by Franklin in prior fiscal years were outstanding with an aggregate principal amount due of 700.0 million. The notes were issued at fixed interest rates and consist of 300.0 million at 2.800 per annum which mature in 2022, 400.0 million at 2.850 per annum which mature in 2025. At September 30, 2021, a total of 1,893.7 million of the notes issued by Franklin were outstanding with an aggregate principal amount due of 1,900.0 million. 
 At September 30, 2021, Legg Mason s outstanding senior unsecured unsubordinated notes had an aggregate principal amount due of 1,250.0 million. The notes have fixed interest rates from 3.950 to 5.625 with interest payable semi-annually and have an aggregate carrying value, inclusive of unamortized premium, of 1,518.3 million at September 30, 2021. Effective August 2, 2021, Franklin has agreed to unconditionally and irrevocably guarantee all of the outstanding notes issued by Legg Mason. 
 The Franklin and Legg Mason senior notes contain an optional redemption feature that allows us to redeem each series of notes prior to maturity in whole or in part at any time, at a make-whole redemption price. The indentures governing the senior notes contain limitations on our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to pledge voting stock or profit participating equity interests in our subsidiaries to secure other debt without similarly securing the notes equally and ratably. In addition, the indentures include requirements that must be met if we consolidate or merge with, or sell all of our assets to, another entity. We were in compliance with all debt covenants at September 30, 2021. 
 At September 30, 2021, we had 500.0 million of short-term commercial paper available for issuance under an uncommitted private placement program which has been inactive since 2012 and is unrated. 
 Our ability to access the capital markets in a timely manner depends on a number of factors, including our credit rating, the condition of the global economy, investors willingness to purchase our securities, interest rates, credit spreads and the valuation levels of equity markets. If we are unable to access capital markets in a timely manner, our business could be adversely impacted. 
 Uses of Capital 
 We expect that our main uses of cash will be to invest in and grow our business including through acquisitions, pay stockholder dividends, invest in our products, pay income taxes and operating expenses of the business, enhance technology infrastructure and business processes, repurchase shares of our common stock, and repay and service debt. While we expect to continue to repurchase shares to offset dilution from share-based compensation, and expect to continue to repurchase shares opportunistically from time to time, we will likely spend more of our post-dividend free cash flow investing in our business, including seed capital and acquiring resources to help grow our investment teams and operations. 
 In the ordinary course of business, we enter into contracts or purchase obligations with third parties whereby the third parties provide goods or services to or on behalf of the Company. Purchase obligations include contractual amounts that will be due to purchase goods and services to be used in our operations and are recorded as liabilities in the consolidated financial statements when services are provided. At September 30, 2021, we had 471.8 million of purchase obligations. 
 We typically declare cash dividends on a quarterly basis, subject to approval by our Board of Directors. We declared regular dividends of 1.12 per share 0.28 per share per quarter) in fiscal year 2021, and of 1.08 per share 0.27 per share per quarter) in fiscal year 2020. We currently expect to continue paying comparable regular dividends on a quarterly basis to holders of our common stock depending upon earnings and other relevant factors.

We maintain a stock repurchase program to manage our equity capital with the objective of maximizing shareholder value. Our stock repurchase program is effected through regular open-market purchases and private transactions in accordance with applicable laws and regulations, and is not subject to an expiration date. The size and timing of these purchases will depend on business conditions, price, market and other factors. During fiscal years 2021 and 2020, we repurchased 7.3 million and 9.0 million shares of our common stock at a cost of 208.2 million and 219.4 million. At September 30, 2021, 30.9 million shares remained available for repurchase under the authorization of 80.0 million shares approved by our Board of Directors in April 2018. 
 We routinely make cash investments in the course of launching sponsored funds. At September 30, 2021, we had 285.1 million of committed capital contributions which relate to discretionary commitments to invest in sponsored funds and other investment products and entities, including CIPs. These unfunded commitments are not recorded in the consolidated balance sheet. 
 We invested 182.2 million, net of redemptions, in our sponsored products during fiscal year 2021, and redeemed 636.6 million, net of investments, during fiscal year 2020. 
 On November 1, 2021, we entered into an acquisition agreement to acquire all of the outstanding ownership interests in Lexington Partners L.P. for cash consideration of approximately 1.0 billion to be paid at closing and additional cash payments totaling 750.0 million to be paid over the next three years. The acquisition is expected to be completed in the second quarter of the fiscal year 2022 and is expected to be funded from available cash. 
 On September 29, 2021, we entered into an acquisition agreement to acquire all of the outstanding ownership interests in O'Shaughnessy Asset Management for cash consideration of approximately 300.0 million, excluding future payments to be made upon the attainment of certain performance measures. The acquisition is expected to be completed in the first quarter of fiscal year 2022 and is expected to be funded from available cash. 
 The funds that we manage have their own resources available for purposes of providing liquidity to meet shareholder redemptions, including securities that can be sold or provided to investors as in-kind redemptions, and lines of credit. Increased liquidity risks and redemptions have required, and may continue to require, increased cash in the form of loans or other lines of credit to help settle redemptions and for other related purposes. While we have no legal or contractual obligation to do so, we have in certain instances voluntarily elected to provide the funds with direct or indirect financial support based on our business objectives. In April 2020, we authorized loans aggregating up to 5.0 billion Indian Rupees (approximately 66.2 million) to certain sponsored funds in India that had experienced increased liquidity risks and redemptions and are in the process of winding up. The loans were fully repaid during the second quarter of fiscal year 2021. See Note 16 Commitments and Contingencies in the notes to consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report for further information. We did not provide financial or other support to our sponsored funds during fiscal year 2021 or 2020. 
 
 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
 Our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, which require the use of estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. These estimates, judgments and assumptions are affected by our application of accounting policies. Further, global concerns about the COVID-19 pandemic have adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect, our business, financial condition and results of operations including the estimates and assumptions made by management. Actual results could differ from the estimates. Described below are the accounting policies that we believe are most critical to understanding our financial position and results of operations. For additional information about our accounting policies, see Note 1 Significant Accounting Policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report. 
 Consolidation 
 We consolidate our subsidiaries and investment products in which we have a controlling financial interest. We have a controlling financial interest when we own a majority of the voting interest in a voting interest entity VOE or are the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity VIE ). 
 
 52 

Table of Contents 

A VIE is an entity in which the equity investment holders have not contributed sufficient capital to finance its activities or do not have defined rights and obligations normally associated with an equity investment. The assessment of whether an entity is a VIE or VOE involves judgment and analysis on a structure by structure basis. When performing the assessment, we consider factors such as the entity s legal organization, design and capital structure, the rights of the equity investment holders and our contractual involvement with and ownership interest in the entity. Our VIEs are primarily investment products and our variable interests consist of our equity ownership interests in and investment management fees earned from these products. 
 We are the primary beneficiary of a VIE if we have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the VIE s economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses of or right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. Investment management fees earned from VIEs are excluded from the primary beneficiary determination if they are deemed to be at market and commensurate with service. The key assumption used in the analysis includes the amount of AUM. These estimates and assumptions are subject to variability. For example, AUM is impacted by market volatility and the level of sales, redemptions, distributions to investors and reinvested distributions. There is judgment involved in assessing whether we have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact VIEs economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses of or right to receive benefits from VIEs that could potentially be significant to the VIEs. As of September 30, 2021, we were the primary beneficiary of 50 investment product VIEs. 
 Business Combinations 
 Business combinations are accounted for by recognizing the acquired assets, including separately identifiable intangible assets, and assumed liabilities at their acquisition-date estimated fair values. Any excess of the purchase consideration over the acquisition-date fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recognized as goodwill. Determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. During the measurement period, which is not to exceed one year from the acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period, any subsequent adjustments are recorded in earnings. 
 Intangible assets acquired in business combinations consist primarily of investment management contracts and trade names. The fair values of the acquired management contracts are based on the net present value of estimated future cash flows attributable to the contracts, which include significant assumptions about forecasts of the AUM growth rate, pre-tax profit margin, discount rate, average effective fee rate and effective tax rate. The fair value of trade names is determined using the relief from royalty method based on net present value of estimated future cash flows, which include significant assumptions about royalty rate, revenue growth rate, discount rate and effective tax rate. Our estimates are based on assumptions believed to be reasonable, but are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, may differ from actual results. 
 Our management contract intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives, which range from three to fifteen years, using the straight-line method, unless the asset is determined to have an indefinite useful life. Indefinite-lived intangible assets represent contracts to manage investment assets for which there is no foreseeable limit on the contract period. Trade names are amortized over their estimated useful lives which range from five to twenty years using the straight-line method. 
 Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually and when an event occurs or circumstances change that more likely than not reduce the fair value of the related reporting unit or indefinite-lived intangible asset below its carrying value. We have one reporting unit, investment management and related services, consistent with our single operating segment, to which all goodwill has been assigned. We make significant estimates and assumptions when evaluating goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment. 
 We may first assess goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative impairment test. The qualitative analysis considers entity-specific and macroeconomic factors and their potential impact on key assumptions used in the determination of the fair value of the reporting unit or indefinite-lived intangible asset. A quantitative impairment test is performed if the results of the qualitative assessment indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value or an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired, or if a qualitative assessment is not performed. Quantitative tests compare the fair value of the asset to its carrying value.

Table of Contents 

The fair values of the reporting unit and indefinite-lived intangible assets are based on the net present value of estimated future cash flows, which include significant assumptions about the AUM growth rate, pre-tax profit margin, discount rate, average effective fee rate and effective tax rate. The most relevant of these assumptions to the determination of estimated fair value are the AUM growth rate, pre-tax profit margin and the discount rate. 
 We performed a qualitative annual impairment test for goodwill and all indefinite-lived intangible assets as of August 1, 2021 and concluded it is more likely than not that the fair values of the reporting unit and the indefinite-lived intangible assets exceed their carrying values. 
 We subsequently monitored market conditions and their potential impact on the assumptions used in the annual assessment to determine whether circumstances have changed that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying value, or indicate that the other indefinite-lived intangible assets might be impaired. We considered, among other things, changes in our AUM and weighted-average cost of capital by assessing whether these changes would impact the reasonableness of our impairment assessment as of August 1, 2021. We also monitored fluctuations of our common stock per share price to evaluate our market capitalization relative to the reporting unit as a whole. Subsequent to August 1, 2021, there were no impairments of goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets as no events occurred or circumstances changed that would indicate these assets might be impaired. 
 We test definite-lived intangible assets for impairment quarterly. Impairment is indicated when the carrying value of an asset is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value. Recoverability is evaluated based on estimated undiscounted future cash flows using assumptions about the AUM growth rate, pre-tax profit margin, average effective fee rate and expected useful life as well as royalty rate for trade name intangible assets. The most relevant of these assumptions to determine future cash flows is the AUM growth rate. If the carrying value of an asset is not recoverable through undiscounted cash flows, impairment is recognized in the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the asset s fair value, as determined by discounted cash flows or other methods as appropriate for the asset type. There were no impairments of definite-lived intangible assets during fiscal year 2021. 
 While we believe that the assumptions used to estimate fair value in our impairment tests are reasonable and appropriate, future changes in the assumptions could result in recognition of impairment. 
 Fair Value Measurements 
 Our investments are primarily recorded at fair value or amounts that approximate fair value on a recurring basis. We use a three-level fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value based on whether the inputs to those valuation techniques are observable or unobservable. The assessment of the hierarchy level of the assets or liabilities measured at fair value is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. See Note 1 Significant Accounting Policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report for more information on the fair value hierarchy. 
 As of September 30, 2021, Level 3 assets represented 9 of total assets measured at fair value, substantially all of which related to CIPs investments in equity and debt securities, and real estate. There were 23.1 million of transfers into and 5.0 million of transfers out of Level 3 during fiscal year 2021. 
 The following are descriptions of the significant assets measured at fair value and their fair value methodologies. 
 Sponsored funds and separate accounts consist primarily of investments in nonconsolidated sponsored funds and to a lesser extent, separate accounts. Changes in the fair value of the investments are recognized as gains and losses in earnings. The fair values of fund products are determined based on their published NAV or estimated using NAV as a practical expedient. The fair values of the underlying investments in the separate accounts are determined using quoted market prices, or independent third-party broker or dealer price quotes if quoted market prices are not available. 
 Investments related to long-term incentive plans consist primarily of investments in sponsored funds related to certain compensation plans that have certain vesting provisions. Changes in fair value are recognized as gains and losses in earnings. The fair values of the investments are determined based on the fund products published NAV or estimated using NAV as a practical expedient. 
 Other equity and debt securities consist of other equity investment securities and trading debt securities. Changes in the fair value are recognized as gains and losses in earnings. The fair values of equity securities other than fund products are determined using independent third-party broker or dealer price quotes or based on discounted cash flows using 
 
 54 

Table of Contents 

significant unobservable inputs. The fair values of debt securities are determined using independent third-party broker or dealer price quotes or based on discounted cash flows using significant unobservable inputs. 
 Investments of CIPs consist of marketable debt and equity securities and other investments that are not generally traded in active markets. Changes in the fair value of the investments are recognized as gains and losses in earnings. The fair values of marketable securities are determined using quoted market prices, or independent third-party broker or dealer price quotes if quoted market prices are not available. The investments that are not generally traded in active markets consist of loans, other equity and debt securities of entities in emerging markets, fund products and real estate. The fair values are determined using significant unobservable inputs in either a market-based or income-based approach, except for fund products, for which fair values are estimated using NAV as a practical expedient. 
 Noncontrolling interests consist of third-party equity interests in CIPs and minority interests in certain subsidiaries. Noncontrolling interests that are redeemable or convertible for cash or other assets at the option of the noncontrolling interest holders and are classified as temporary equity at fair value, except when the fair value is less than the issuance date fair value, the reported amount is the issuance date fair value. Changes in fair value of redeemable noncontrolling interest is recognized as an adjustment to retained earnings. Nonredeemable noncontrolling interests do not permit the noncontrolling interest holders to request settlement, are reported at their issuance value and undistributed net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests. 
 The fair value of third-party equity interests in CIPs are determined based on the published NAV or estimated using NAV a practical expedient. The fair value of redeemable noncontrolling interests related to minority interest in certain subsidiaries are derived using discounted cash flows and guideline public company methodology, which include significant assumptions about forecasts of the AUM growth rate, pre-tax profit margin, discount rate and operating income multiples. 
 Revenues 
 We earn revenue primarily from providing investment management and related services to our customers. In addition to investment management, services include fund administration, sales and distribution, and shareholder servicing. Revenues are recognized when our obligations related to the services are satisfied and it is probable that a significant reversal of the revenue amount would not occur in future periods. The obligations are satisfied over time as the services are rendered, except for the sales and distribution obligations for the sale of shares of sponsored funds, which are satisfied on trade date. Multiple services included in customer contracts are accounted for separately when the obligations are determined to be distinct. Management judgment is involved in assessing the probability of significant revenue reversal and in the identification of distinct services. 
 Fees from providing investment management and fund administration services investment management fees ), other than performance-based investment management fees, are determined based on a percentage of AUM, primarily on a monthly basis using daily average AUM, and are recognized as the services are performed over time. Performance-based investment management fees are generated when investment products performance exceeds targets established in customer contracts. These fees are recognized when significant reversal of the amount is no longer probable and may relate to investment management services that were provided in prior periods. 
 Sales and distribution fees primarily consist of upfront sales commissions and ongoing distribution fees. Sales commissions are based on contractual rates for sales of certain classes of sponsored funds and are recognized on trade date. Distribution service fees are determined based on a percentage of AUM, primarily on a monthly basis using daily average AUM. As the fee amounts are uncertain on trade date, they are recognized over time as the amounts become known and may relate to sales and distribution services provided in prior periods. 
 AUM is generally based on the fair value of the underlying securities held by investment products and is calculated using fair value methods derived primarily from unadjusted quoted market prices, unadjusted independent third-party broker or dealer price quotes in active markets, or market prices or price quotes adjusted for observable price movements after the close of the primary market. The fair values of securities for which market prices are not readily available are valued internally using various methodologies which incorporate significant unobservable inputs as appropriate for each security type. Pricing of the securities is governed by our global valuation and pricing policy, which defines valuation and pricing conventions for each security type, including practices for responding to unexpected or unusual market events. 
 As substantially all of our AUM is valued based on observable market prices or inputs, market risk is the most significant risk underlying the valuation of our AUM.

Income Taxes 
 Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded for temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements using the statutory tax rates in effect for the year when the reported amount of the asset or liability is expected to be recovered or settled, respectively. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income tax expense in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying values of deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. In assessing whether a valuation allowance should be established against a deferred income tax asset, we consider all positive and negative evidence, which includes timing of expiration, projected sources of taxable income, limitations on utilization under the statute and the effectiveness of prudent and feasible tax planning strategies among other factors. For each tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return, we utilize significant judgment related to the range of possible favorable or unfavorable outcomes to determine whether it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination based on the technical merits of the position, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation. A tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 likely of being realized upon settlement. 
 We operate in numerous countries, states and other taxing jurisdictions. The income tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and the relevant taxing authorities. Significant judgment is required in the determination of our annual income tax provisions, which includes the assessment of deferred tax assets and uncertain tax positions, as well as the interpretation and application of existing and newly enacted tax laws, regulation changes, and new judicial rulings. We repatriate foreign earnings that are in excess of regulatory, capital or operational requirements of all of our non-U.S. subsidiaries. 
 It is possible that actual results will vary from those recognized in our consolidated financial statements due to changes in the interpretation of applicable guidance or as a result of examinations by taxing authorities. 
 Loss Contingencies 
 We are involved in various lawsuits and claims encountered in the normal course of business. When such a matter arises and periodically thereafter, we consult with our legal counsel and evaluate the merits of the claims based on the facts available at that time. In management s opinion, an adequate accrual has been made as of September 30, 2021 to provide for any probable losses that may arise from such matters for which we could reasonably estimate an amount. See also Note 16 Commitments and Contingencies in the notes to consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report.

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 In the normal course of business, our financial position is subject to market risk, including, but not limited to, potential loss due to changes in the value of financial instruments including those resulting from adverse changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and market valuation. Financial instruments include, but are not limited to, investment securities and debt obligations. Management is responsible for managing market risk. Our Enterprise Risk Management Committee is responsible for providing a framework to assist management to identify, assess and manage market and other risks. 
 Our market risk from assets and liabilities of CIPs is limited to that of our direct equity investments in them and investment management fees earned from them. Accordingly, the assets and liabilities of CIPs are excluded from the discussion below. 
 AUM Market Price Risk 
 We are exposed to market risk through our investment management and distribution fees, which are generally calculated as a percentage of AUM. Changes in equity market prices, interest rates, credit spreads, foreign exchange rates, or a combination of these factors could cause the value of AUM to decline, which would result in lower investment management and distribution fees. Our exposure to these risks is reduced as we sponsor a broad range of investment products in various global jurisdictions, which serves to mitigate the impact of changes in any particular market or region. 
 Assuming the respective effective fee rates and asset mix remain unchanged, a proportional 10 change in the value of our average AUM would result in corresponding 10 changes in our investment management fees and asset-based distribution fee revenues, excluding performance-based investment management fees. Such a change for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021 would have resulted in an increase or decrease in operating revenues of 758.5 million. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 We are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily through our investments in funds that invest in debt securities, which were 1,606.0 million at September 30, 2021. Our exposure to interest rate risks from these investments is mitigated by the low average duration exposure and a broad range of products in various global jurisdictions. We had no exposure to changes in interest rates from debt obligations at September 30, 2021 as all of our outstanding debt was issued at fixed rates. 
 As of September 30, 2021, we have considered the potential impact of a 100 basis point movement in market interest rates on our investments in funds that invest in debt securities. Based on our analysis, we do not expect that such a change would have a material impact on our earnings in the next 12 months. 
 Foreign Currency Exchange Risk 
 We are subject to foreign currency exchange risk through our international operations. While the majority of our revenues are earned in the U.S., we also provide services and earn revenues in Europe, Middle East and Africa, Asia-Pacific and Americas excluding U.S. Our exposure to foreign currency exchange risk is reduced in relation to our results of operations since a significant portion of these revenues is denominated in U.S. dollars. This situation may change in the future as our business continues to grow outside the U.S. and expenses incurred denominated in foreign currencies increase. 
 The exposure to foreign currency exchange risk in our consolidated balance sheet mostly relates to cash and cash equivalents and investments that are denominated in foreign currencies, primarily in the Euro, Pound Sterling, Indian Rupee, Canadian dollar and Australian dollar. These assets accounted for 22 of the total cash and cash equivalents and investments at September 30, 2021. 
 A 10 weakening of the U.S. dollar against the various foreign currencies to which we had exposure as described above would result in corresponding 10 increases in the U.S. dollar values of the foreign currency assets and 10 decreases in the foreign currency values of the U.S. dollar assets. Such a weakening as of September 30, 2021 would result in a 93.4 million increase in accumulated other comprehensive income and a 29.7 million decrease in pre-tax earnings. We generally do not use derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency exchange risk exposure. As a result, both positive and negative currency fluctuations against the U.S. dollar may affect our results of operations and accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).

Market Valuation Risk 
 We are exposed to market valuation risks related to securities we hold that are carried at fair value. To mitigate the risks we maintain a diversified investment portfolio and, from time to time, we may enter into derivative agreements. 
 The following is a summary of the effect of a 10 increase or decrease in the carrying values of our financial instruments subject to market valuation risks at September 30, 2021. If such a 10 increase or decrease in carrying values were to occur, the changes from investments measured at fair value and direct investments in CIPs would result in a 163.1 million increase or decrease in our pre-tax earnings.

MANAGEMENT S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING 
 The management of Franklin Resources, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries (the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the Company. The Company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed under the supervision of the Company s principal executive and principal financial officers to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the Company s financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
 The Company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
 Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2021, based on the framework set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013). Based on that assessment, management concluded that, as of September 30, 2021, the Company s internal control over financial reporting was effective. 
 The effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2021 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that audits the Company s consolidated financial statements, as stated in their report immediately following this report, which expresses an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2021.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
 To the Board of Directors 
 and Stockholders of Franklin Resources, Inc. 
 
 Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Franklin Resources, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the Company as of September 30, 2021 and 2020, and the related consolidated statements of income, of comprehensive income, of stockholders equity and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2021, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements ). We also have audited the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). 
 In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of September 30, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2021 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO. 
 Basis for Opinions 
 The Company s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company s consolidated financial statements and on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. 
 Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. 
 Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of 
 
 61 

Table of Contents 

management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
 Critical Audit Matters 
 The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. 
 Realizability of Deferred Tax Assets 
 As described in Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company had gross deferred tax assets of 1,169.8 million as of September 30, 2021, reduced by a 319.3 million valuation allowance. Management records a valuation allowance to reduce the carrying values of deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. In assessing whether a valuation allowance should be established against a deferred income tax asset, management considers all positive and negative evidence, which includes timing of expiration, projected sources of taxable income, limitations on utilization under the statute, and effectiveness of prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. 
 The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the realizability of deferred tax assets is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment by management when assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, which in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence relating to management s assessment of the realizability of deferred tax assets and significant assumptions relating to the timing of expiration, projected sources of taxable income, limitations on utilization under the statute, and effectiveness of prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. 
 Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the realizability of deferred tax assets, including controls over the completeness and accuracy of data relevant to the analysis, determination of projected sources of taxable income and expected utilization of deferred tax assets. These procedures also included, among others: (i) evaluating management s assessment of the realizability of deferred tax assets and the need for a valuation allowance, (ii) evaluating the reasonableness of management s significant assumptions related to timing of expiration, projected sources of taxable income, limitations on utilization under the statute and effectiveness of prudent and feasible tax planning strategies, (iii) evaluating the prudence and feasibility of the implementation of available tax planning strategies, and (iv) testing the completeness and accuracy of the data utilized in the assessment of the realizability of deferred tax assets.

 reporting unit, investment management and related services, consistent with its single operating segment, to which all goodwill has been assigned. Amortization and impairment are recognized in general, administrative and other expense. 
 Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets may first be assessed for qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative impairment test. The qualitative analysis considers entity-specific and macroeconomic factors and their potential impact on the key assumptions used in the determination of the fair value of the reporting unit or indefinite-lived intangible asset. A quantitative impairment test is performed if the results of the qualitative assessment indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value or an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired, or if a qualitative assessment is not performed. 
 The fair values of the reporting unit and indefinite-lived intangible assets are based on the net present value of estimated future cash flows, which include assumptions about the AUM growth rate, pre-tax profit margin, discount rate, average effective fee rate and effective tax rate. 
 If a quantitative goodwill impairment test indicates that the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, impairment is recognized in the amount of the difference in values not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. 
 If a quantitative indefinite-lived intangible assets impairment test indicates that the carrying value of the asset exceeds the fair value, impairment is recognized in the amount of the difference in values. 
 Definite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment quarterly. Impairment is indicated when the carrying value of an asset is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value. Recoverability is evaluated based on estimated undiscounted future cash flows using assumptions about the AUM growth rate, pre-tax profit margin, average effective fee rate and expected useful lives as well as royalty rate for trade name intangible assets. If the carrying value of an asset is not recoverable through undiscounted cash flows, impairment is recognized in the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the asset s fair value, as determined by discounted cash flows or other methods as appropriate for the asset type.

Such settlements may involve some or all of the following: the payment of additional taxes, the adjustment of deferred taxes and/or the recognition of unrecognized tax benefits. The Company has recognized a tax benefit only for those positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold. It is reasonably possible that the total unrecognized tax benefit as of September 30, 2021 could decrease by an estimated million within the next twelve months as a result of the expiration of statutes of limitations in the U.S. federal and certain U.S. state and local and non-U.S. tax jurisdictions, and potential settlements with U.S. states and non-U.S. taxing authorities. 
 The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act which was enacted into law in the U.S. in December 2017, includes various changes to the tax law, including a permanent reduction in the corporate income tax rate and assessment of a one-time transition tax on the deemed repatriation of post-1986 undistributed foreign subsidiaries earnings.

 billion. In connection with the wind-up decision, FTTS sought to convene unitholder meetings for the Funds to approve the appointment of a liquidator and the asset management company to the Funds, Franklin Templeton Asset Management (India) Private Limited FTAMI ), ceased earning investment management fees on the Funds. 
 In May and June 2020, certain Fund unitholders and others commenced multiple writ petition actions in different courts in India against a number of respondents, including Franklin, its subsidiaries FTTS, FTAMI, and Templeton International, Inc., as sponsor of the Franklin Templeton Mutual Fund, and related individuals (collectively, the Company Respondents ), the Securities and Exchange Board of India SEBI ), and other governmental entities. The petitioners challenged the decision to wind up the Funds and alleged that the Company Respondents violated various SEBI regulations, mismanaged the Funds, misrepresented or omitted certain information relating to the Funds, and/or engaged in other alleged misconduct. The petitioners requested a wide range of relief, including, among other items, an order quashing the winding up notices and blocking the unitholder votes, initiating investigations into the Company Respondents, and allowing the unitholder petitioners to redeem their investments with interest. One of the petitioners obtained an interim injunction order staying the operation and implementation of the unitholder voting process. Following appeals to the Supreme Court of India, the petitions were transferred to the High Court of Karnataka for further consolidated proceedings. 
 In October 2020, the High Court of Karnataka issued its judgment, in which it upheld the decision taken by FTTS to wind up the Funds and held that there was nothing wrong with the decision making process, but determined that, under applicable regulations, unitholder approval is required to implement the decision. Certain Company Respondents and other parties filed cross-appeals to the Supreme Court of India, and certain intervenors filed applications, challenging aspects of the High Court s judgment. In December 2020, with the approval of the Supreme Court, and without prejudice to its arguments on appeal that unitholder approval of the wind-up decision is not required, FTTS proceeded to obtain approval from the majority of the voting unitholders for winding up the six Funds. In February 2021, the Supreme Court issued a decision confirming the results of the unitholder votes and appointed a third-party asset manager to serve as the liquidator and begin cash distributions to unitholders. 
 In July 2021, the Supreme Court issued a ruling interpreting applicable regulations to require unitholder consent to effect a trustee s decision to wind up a fund, while finding that, upon the trustee s publication of its decision to unitholders under applicable regulations, fund business activities, including redemptions, are suspended pending the results of the unitholder vote. The Supreme Court further found that FTTS April 2020 publication to unitholders of its wind-up decision complied with applicable regulations, effectively freezing redemptions. Further hearings are anticipated to be scheduled in connection with the remaining issues on appeal.

 billion has been distributed to Fund unitholders. 
 Separately, following the completion of a forensic audit/inspection, in late November and early December 2020, SEBI initiated regulatory proceedings by issuing show cause notices against FTAMI, FTTS and certain FTAMI employees (including in their officer or director capacities), alleging certain deficiencies and areas of non-compliance in the management of the Funds. In June 2021, SEBI issued orders against FTAMI, FTTS, and the FTAMI employee respondents, finding violations of certain regulatory provisions, including with respect to similarity in investment strategies among the Funds, calculation of duration and valuation of portfolio securities, deficiencies in documentation relating to investment diligence and investment terms, and portfolio risk management. SEBI s orders include, as applicable, aggregate monetary penalties of INR 20.0 crore (approximately million); disgorgement of investment management and advisory fees, together with interest through the date of SEBI s order, totaling INR 512.5 crore (approximately million), with continuing accrual of interest until paid; and a prohibition on FTAMI from launching new fixed income funds in India for a two-year period. The respondents filed appeals, as well as applications to stay enforcement of SEBI s orders pending resolution of the appeals, with the Securities Appellate Tribunal (the SAT in India. In June 2021, the SAT granted the stay requested by FTAMI, subject to FTAMI s deposit of INR 250.0 crore (approximately million) into an escrow account, which has been deposited. In July 2021, SEBI appealed the SAT s stay order to the Supreme Court of India. Based on FTAMI s submission that it would not launch new fixed income schemes in India pending resolution of its appeal, the Supreme Court of India did not interfere with the SAT s stay order with respect to the monetary amounts and disposed of SEBI s appeal. In July 2021, the SAT also granted the stay requests of FTTS and the FTAMI employee respondents, subject to the deposit of an aggregate of INR 7.5 crore (approximately million) into an escrow account. The SAT appeals remain pending. 
 The Company is also responding to related inquiries and investigations commenced by certain governmental agencies in India, including the previously-reported first information report (the preliminary step in an investigation) registered by the Economic Offences Wing of the Chennai police department against certain of the Company Respondents in connection with a complaint by two Fund unitholders, as well as a related investigation by India s Enforcement Directorate commenced in or around April 2021. The Company is cooperating in these matters. 
 The Company strongly believes that the decision taken by FTTS to wind up the Funds was in the best interests of unitholders. The Company further believes that it has meritorious defenses to the outstanding claims in the pending proceedings and intends to continue vigorously defending against the claims. The Company cannot at this time predict the eventual outcome of the matters described above or reasonably estimate the possible loss or range of loss that may arise from any final outcome of such matters, including due to the complexities and uncertainty involved in the appeals and the various questions of law and fact at issue. 
 Other Litigation Matters. The Company is from time to time involved in other litigation relating to claims arising in the normal course of business. Management is of the opinion that the ultimate resolution of such claims will not materially affect the Company s business, financial position, results of operations or liquidity. In management s opinion, an adequate accrual has been made as of September 30, 2021 to provide for any probable losses that may arise from such matters for which the Company could reasonably estimate an amount. 
 Indemnifications and Guarantees 
 In the ordinary course of business or in connection with certain acquisition agreements, the Company enters into contracts that provide for indemnifications by the Company in certain circumstances. In addition, certain Company entities guarantee certain financial and performance-related obligations of various Franklin subsidiaries. The Company is also subject to certain legal requirements and agreements providing for indemnifications of directors, officers and personnel against liabilities and expenses they may incur under certain circumstances in connection with their service in those positions. The terms of these indemnities and guarantees vary pursuant to applicable facts and circumstances, and from agreement to agreement. Future payments for claims against the Company under these indemnities or guarantees could negatively impact the Company s financial condition. In management s opinion, no material loss was deemed probable or reasonably possible pursuant to such indemnification agreements and/or guarantees as of September 30, 2021.

 WHEREAS, the Company recognizes the efforts of Participant on behalf of the Company and its Subsidiaries and desires to motivate Participant in Participant s work and provide an inducement to remain in the service of the Company and its Subsidiaries and 
 
 WHEREAS, the Company has determined that it would be to the advantage and in the interest of the Company and its stockholders to award Units provided for in this Agreement and the Notice of Award to Participant, subject to certain restrictions, as an incentive for increased efforts and successful achievements 
 
 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing premises and of the mutual covenants herein contained, the parties hereto hereby agree as follows 
 
 1. Restricted Stock Unit Award . The Company is awarding to Participant Units as set forth in the Notice of Award, subject to the rights of and limitations on Participant as owner thereof as set forth in this Agreement. The Award shall be in consideration of Participant s execution of this Agreement and the covenants herein. 
 
 2. Transfer Restriction . Units may not be transferred by Participant in any manner except that Units may be transferred by will or by the laws of descent and distribution if Participant dies while an employee or Consultant of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and holds vested Units as of the date of such death. 
 
 3. Vesting . 
 
 (a) Units shall become vested in accordance with the Vesting Schedule in the Notice of Award so long as Participant maintains a Continuous Status as an Employee or Consultant, subject to Section 16 below. 
 
 (b) If Participant ceases to maintain a Continuous Status as an Employee or Consultant for any reason except as otherwise provided in this Section 3, then all Units to the extent not yet vested under Section 3(a) on the date Participant ceases to maintain a Continuous Status as an Employee or Consultant shall be forfeited by Participant without payment of any consideration to Participant therefor.

The first criteria is that the Participant is not joining a competitor or otherwise providing services in competition with the Company or its Subsidiaries. The remaining criteria that may be taken into consideration shall be in the discretion of the Company.

 (f) Termination of Service Due to Retirement . In the event of termination of Participant s Continuous Status as an Employee or Consultant as a result of Retirement while an employee or Consultant of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and so long as Participant does not engage in Competitive Activity and subject to Participant s continued compliance with all applicable conditions and criteria, Participant s interest in all such Units awarded hereunder shall continue to vest as if the Participant had not left the Company, provided that such Retirement is without Cause.

In the event of Participant s death during the period in which unvested Units awarded hereunder are continuing to vest under this clause (f), then, as of the date that the Company is notified in writing or becomes aware of such death, Participant s unvested Units hereunder shall become fully vested as of such applicable date. 
 
 Unless changed by the Committee 
 
 Competitive Activity means Participant s engagement in any activity that competes with any of the business operations of the Company and or its Subsidiaries, as determined by the Committee, in its sole discretion, and shall include, without limitation, representing in any capacity, other than as an outside director, a company that competes with the Company and its Subsidiaries.

Notwithstanding the above, the Company may, in its discretion, pay to Participant all or a portion of any vested Units in cash in an amount equal to the Fair Market Value of the relevant number of Shares on the applicable Vesting Date, or on such other date or dates within the Short-Term Deferral Period which the Company may at its absolute discretion prescribe, less any tax or other withholding obligations set forth in Section 6 of this Agreement.

6. Withholding of Taxes . 
 
 (a) General . Participant is ultimately liable and responsible for all taxes owed by Participant in connection with the Plan including, without limitation, the award of Units, vesting of Units, issue and sale of Shares regardless of any action the Company or any of its Subsidiaries takes with respect to any tax withholding obligations that arise in connection with the Plan. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries makes any representation or undertaking regarding the treatment of any tax withholding in connection with the grant or vesting of Units awarded or the subsequent sale of any of the Shares. The Company and its Subsidiaries do not commit, and are under no obligation to structure the Award, to reduce or eliminate Participant s tax liability. 
 
 (b) Payment of Withholding Taxes . Prior to any event in connection with Units awarded e.g. , vesting) that the Company determines may result in any tax withholding obligation, whether United States federal, state or local taxes or any applicable foreign taxes and including without limitation any employment tax obligation (the Tax Withholding Obligation ), Participant must agree to the satisfaction of such Tax Withholding Obligation in a manner acceptable to the Company, including by one of the following methods 
 
 (i) By Share Withholding. Unless the Company permits Participant to satisfy the Tax Withholding Obligation by some other means in accordance with clause (iii) below, Participant authorizes the Company (in the exercise of its sole discretion) to withhold from those Shares issuable to Participant the whole number of Shares sufficient to satisfy the Tax Withholding Obligation. Share withholding will generally be used to satisfy the tax liability of individuals subject to the short swing profit restrictions of Section 16(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. 
 
 (ii) By Sale of Shares . Unless the Company permits Participant to satisfy the Tax Withholding Obligation by some other means in accordance with clause (iii) below, and provided that the terms of this clause (ii) do not violate Section 13(k) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, Participant s acceptance of the Award constitutes Participant s instruction and authorization to the Company and any brokerage firm determined acceptable to the Company for such purpose to sell on Participant s behalf a whole number of Shares otherwise issuable to Participant as the Company determines to be appropriate to generate cash proceeds sufficient to satisfy the applicable Tax Withholding Obligation. Such Shares will be sold on the day such Tax Withholding Obligation arises e.g. , a Vesting Date) or as soon thereafter as practicable. Participant will be responsible for all brokers fees and other costs of sale, and Participant agrees to indemnify and hold the Company harmless from any losses, costs, damages, or expenses relating to any such sale. To the extent the proceeds of such sale exceed the Tax Withholding Obligation, the Company agrees to pay such excess in cash to Participant. Participant acknowledges that the Company is under no obligation to arrange for such sale at any particular price, and that the proceeds of any such sale may not be sufficient to satisfy the Tax Withholding Obligation. Accordingly, Participant agrees to pay to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as soon as practicable, including through additional payroll withholding, any amount of the Tax Withholding Obligation that is not satisfied by the sale of Shares described above. 
 
 (iii) By Check, Wire Transfer or Other Means . At any time not less than five (5) business days (or such fewer number of days as determined by the Committee or its designee) before any Tax Withholding Obligation arises e.g. , a Vesting Date), Participant may request permission to satisfy the Tax Withholding Obligation by check, wire transfer or other means, by submitting such request, in writing, to the Company. Alternatively, the Company may require that Participant satisfy any Tax Withholding Obligation in any such manner. If the Company approves Participant s request, or so requires, within five (5) business days of the relevant Vesting Date (or such fewer number of days as determined by the Committee or its designee) Participant must deliver to the Company the amount that the Company determines is sufficient to satisfy the Tax Withholding Obligation by (x) wire transfer to such account as the Company may direct, (y) delivery of a certified check payable to the Company, or (z) such other means as specified from time to time by the Committee or its designee. 
 
 7. Successors . This Agreement shall (a) inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the Company s successors and assigns, and (b) be binding on Participant s executors, administrators, heirs and successors, in the event that Participant dies and Section 2 of this Agreement applies. Nothing contained in the Plan, the Notice of 
 4 

Award or this Agreement shall be interpreted as imposing any liability on the Company or the Committee in favor of Participant or any purchaser or other transferee of Units or Shares with respect to any loss, cost or expense which such Participant, purchaser or other transferee may incur in connection with, or arising out of any transaction involving, any Units or Shares subject to the Plan, the Notice of Award or this Agreement. 
 
 8. No Compensation Deferrals . This Agreement, the Notice of Award and the Plan are intended to be exempt from or to comply with Section 409A Section 409A of the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and shall be administered and construed in accordance with such intent. The Company reserves the right, to the extent the Company deems necessary or advisable in its sole discretion, unilaterally to amend or modify, or to take any other actions, as the Committee determines are necessary or appropriate with respect to, the Plan, the Notice of Award and or this Agreement to ensure that no awards (including, without limitation, the Units) become subject to the requirements of Section 409A, provided, however, that the Company makes no representation that the Units are not subject to Section 409A nor makes any undertaking to preclude Section 409A from applying to the Units. In furtherance, and not in limitation, of the foregoing (a) in no event may Participant designate, directly or indirectly, the calendar year of any payment to be made hereunder and (b) notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, a termination of Service hereunder shall mean and be interpreted consistent with a separation from service within the meaning of Section 409A with respect to any payment hereunder that constitutes a deferral of compensation under Section 409A that becomes due on account of such separation from service. 
 
 9. Integration . The terms of the Plan, the Notice of Award and this Agreement are intended by the Company and Participant to be the final expression of their agreement with respect to Units and may not be contradicted by evidence of any prior or contemporaneous agreement. The Company and Participant further intend that the Plan, the Notice of Award and this Agreement shall constitute the complete and exclusive statement of their terms and that no extrinsic evidence whatsoever may be introduced in any arbitration, judicial, administrative or other legal proceeding involving the Plan, the Notice of Award or this Agreement. Accordingly, the Plan, the Notice of Award and this Agreement contain the entire understanding between the parties and supersede all prior oral, written and implied agreements, understandings, commitments and practices among the parties. 
 
 10. Waivers . Any failure to enforce any terms or conditions of the Plan, the Notice of Award or this Agreement by the Company or by Participant shall not be deemed a waiver of that term or condition, nor shall any waiver or relinquishment of any right or power for all or any other times. 
 
 11. Severability of Provisions . If any provision of the Plan, the Notice of Award or this Agreement shall be held invalid or unenforceable, such invalidity or unenforceability shall not affect any other provision thereof and the Plan, the Notice of Award and this Agreement shall be construed and enforced as if none of them included such provision. 
 
 12. Committee Decisions Conclusive . This Agreement and the Notice of Award are administered and interpreted by the Committee and the Committee has full and exclusive discretion to interpret and administer this Agreement and the Notice of Award. All actions, interpretations and decisions of the Committee are conclusive and binding on all persons, and will be given the maximum possible deference allowed by law. 
 
 13. Mandatory Direct Discussion, Mediation, and Arbitration . To the extent permitted by law, any claim, disagreement, or dispute arising out of or relating to the Plan, the Notice of Award, and or this Agreement, including the meaning or interpretation thereof (a Dispute ), shall be resolved solely and exclusively by direct discussion and mandatory mediation followed, if necessary, by final and binding arbitration in accordance with the terms and procedures specified in this Section 13. These terms and procedures apply solely to the resolution of a Dispute as defined in this Agreement. Any other claim, issue, or complaint raised by Participant who is subject to the Franklin Templeton Investments Alternative Dispute Resolution Policy and Agreement (the ADR Agreement ), which claims, issues or complaints are not covered by this Agreement will be resolved according to the terms and procedures of the ADR Agreement. With regard to any Dispute as defined in this Agreement, if there is a difference between the terms or procedures defined in the ADR Agreement, and the terms and procedures 
 5 

defined in this Agreement, this Agreement s terms and procedures shall control. Participant and the Company specifically agree to waive the right to pursue any Dispute before a court or jury. 
 (a) Direct Discussion . Upon written notice of any Dispute, Participant and the Company (each referred to as a party and together as the parties shall first attempt to resolve the Dispute by direct discussion. 
 
 (b) Mediation . If a Dispute is not resolved by direct discussion then either party may request mediation of the Dispute by sending a written notice requesting mediation to the other party. The parties will mutually agree to the selection of a mediator, whose compensation will be borne by the Company. 
 
 (c) Arbitration . If a Dispute is not resolved by direct discussion and mandatory mediation, then either party may request final and binding arbitration of the Dispute by sending a written notice requesting arbitration to the other party. The Dispute will be heard by a single arbitrator unless, within 45 days of receiving the initial written demand for arbitration, either party elects by written notice to the other party for the arbitration to be heard by a panel of three arbitrators. If a single arbitrator is used, the parties will mutually agree to the selection of the arbitrator. If either party elects for the arbitration to be heard by a panel of three arbitrators, each party will select one arbitrator, and the arbitrators selected by the parties will, within a reasonable period of time, then appoint a third arbitrator to serve as chair of the panel. 
 
 The arbitration will be conducted in accordance with the Employment Arbitration Rules and Mediation Procedures of the American Arbitration Association AAA as amended and effective November 1, 2009 (the AAA Rules but without necessarily retaining AAA or any other third party to administer the arbitration. The parties will determine whether a third-party administration service is necessary and, if jointly deemed necessary, agree to a mutually acceptable arbitration administration service, whether AAA or otherwise, within 45 days of receipt of the initial written demand for arbitration. If the parties do not agree about whether a third party is needed to administer the arbitration, or if the parties cannot reach agreement as to which administration service to use within 45 days, any arbitration will be administered by AAA. The location for the arbitration shall be in the county or comparable jurisdiction of Participant s Service. Judgment on the award rendered may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. 
 
 The Company will pay all of the costs of arbitration that are attributable to the employer pursuant to the AAA Rules, unless applicable law requires the Company to pay a greater share or all of the costs. In addition, if a single arbitrator is used, or if the Company elects for the arbitration to be heard by a panel of three arbitrators, the compensation and expenses of the arbitrator(s) will be paid by the Company. If Participant elects for the arbitration to be heard by a panel of three arbitrators, Participant will be responsible for paying one-half of the arbitrators compensation and expenses. 
 
 All statutes of limitation that would otherwise be applicable shall apply to any arbitration proceeding under this Section. To the extent permitted by law, Participant waives the right to participate in a class, representative or collective action, as a class representative, class member, as an opt-in party, or private attorney general or join or consolidate claims with claims of any other person or entity, with respect to any Dispute, whether before a court or jury or in arbitration. Nothing in this Agreement, however, is intended or understood to limit, contradict, or preclude the rights reserved by law for Participant to initiate any administrative claim, or to excuse Participant from bringing an administrative claim before any agency in order to fulfill any obligation by Participant to exhaust administrative remedies. The provisions of this Section are intended by Participant and the Company to be exclusive for all purposes and applicable to any and all Disputes. 
 
 Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, or as otherwise mutually agreed by the parties, the arbitrator(s) will conduct the arbitration pursuant to the AAA Rules, the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. section 1, et seq., and the U.S. Federal Rules of Evidence. The arbitrator(s) shall have jurisdiction and authority only to award Participant an amount equal to or less than the amount of the Award challenged in the Dispute, subject to the same terms and conditions as the Notice of Award in Dispute, and shall not have jurisdiction or authority to make any other award of any type, including, without limitation, punitive damages, unforeseeable economic damages, damages for pain, suffering or emotional distress, or any other kind or form of damages (the 
 6 

Arbitrator Authority ). Thus, the arbitrator(s) shall not have jurisdiction or authority to grant preliminary or final injunctive relief or specific performance. The remedy, if any, awarded by the arbitrator(s) within the Arbitrator Authority shall be the sole and exclusive remedy for any Dispute that is subject to arbitration under this Section. 
 
 If Participant is an Associated Person employed by a Member Firm (as each such term is defined by the rules of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority FINRA )), nothing in this Agreement prohibits or restricts Participant or the Member Firm from filing an arbitration claim involving a Dispute in the FINRA arbitration forum as specified in FINRA rules. In such a case, the parties each reserve the right to elect to have the arbitration heard by a panel of three arbitrators regardless of the dollar amount of the claim. The parties further agree that the authority of the arbitrator(s) in any FINRA arbitration of a Dispute is limited to the Arbitrator Authority defined above. Unless otherwise mutually agreed by the parties, the arbitrator(s) will conduct the arbitration pursuant to the FINRA Code of Arbitration Procedure for Industry Disputes (the FINRA Code and the Federal Rules of Evidence. All fees, costs, and expenses of FINRA arbitration, whether a single arbitrator or a panel of arbitrators is selected, including any hearing session fees, arbitration fees, surcharges, and filing fees, will be allocated as specified in the FINRA Code. 
 
 14. Delaware Law . The Plan, the Notice of Award and this Agreement are governed by, and all Disputes arising under or in connection with the Plan, the Notice of Award and this Agreement shall be resolved in accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to its conflict of laws rules, to the extent not pre-empted by the federal laws of the United States of America. 
 
 15. Country Appendices . If Participant relocates to a country outside the United States (i) any special terms and conditions that may apply to Units granted to Participants in such country under Appendices to this Agreement will apply to Participant or (ii) if the Company has not previously granted Restricted Stock Units to employees or Consultants in such country, any other special terms and conditions will apply to Participant, in each case to the extent the Company determines that the application of such terms and conditions is necessary or advisable to comply with local law or facilitate the administration of the Plan, and provided the imposition of the term or condition will not result in any adverse accounting expense with respect to the Units (unless the Company specifically determines to incur such expense). 
 
 16. Forfeiture . 
 
 (a) Forfeiture Pursuant to Restatement of Financial Results . Notwithstanding anything in the Award to the contrary, in the event that (i) the Company issues a restatement of financial results to correct a material error (ii) the Committee determines, in good faith, that fraud or willful misconduct by Participant was a significant contributing factor to the need to issue such restatement and (iii) some or all of the Units that were granted and or Shares and or other property earned prior to such restatement by Participant would not have been granted and or earned, as applicable, based upon the restated financial results, Participant shall immediately return to the Company all Shares and other property received with respect to those Units, including any cash dividends paid with respect to the Units or such Shares, any pre-tax- income derived from ownership and any gross proceeds from disposition of such Shares and property, that would not have been granted and or earned based upon the restated financial results (the Repayment Obligation ), and all such Units (whether or not vested) shall immediately be forfeited. The Company shall be able to enforce the Repayment Obligation by all legal means available, including, without limitation, by withholding such amount from other sums and property owed by the Company to Participant. 
 
 (b) Forfeiture Pursuant to Fraud or Breach of Securities Law . Notwithstanding anything in the Award to the contrary, in the event that Participant 
 
 (i) is convicted by any court for fraud 
 
 (ii) is finally adjudicated by any court or is otherwise finally determined by a Regulatory Agency to be in violation of any Securities Law where the violation related to a period of time during which Participant was an employee or Consultant or

Any Units so forfeited shall be cancelled. 
 
 Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Committee may determine, in its sole discretion, that only a portion of Participant s Units specified by the Committee (or no Units) shall be forfeited. 
 
 For the purposes of this Section 16(b), the following words shall have the following meanings

Prior to any event in connection with Units awarded e.g. , vesting) that the Company determines may result in any tax withholding obligation, whether United States federal, state or local taxes or any applicable foreign taxes and including without limitation any employment tax obligation (the Tax Withholding Obligation ), Participant must agree to the satisfaction of such Tax Withholding Obligation in a manner acceptable to the Company, including by one of the following methods 
 
 (i) By Share Withholding. Unless the Company permits Participant to satisfy the Tax Withholding Obligation by some other means in accordance with clause (iii) below, Participant authorizes the Company (in the exercise of its sole discretion) to withhold from those Shares issuable to Participant the whole number of Shares sufficient to satisfy the Tax Withholding Obligation. Share withholding will generally be used to satisfy the tax liability of individuals subject to the short swing profit restrictions of Section 16(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. 
 
 2 

(ii) By Sale of Shares . Unless the Company permits Participant to satisfy the Tax Withholding Obligation by some other means in accordance with clause (iii) below, and provided that the terms of this clause (ii) do not violate Section 13(k) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, Participant s acceptance of the Award constitutes Participant s instruction and authorization to the Company and any brokerage firm determined acceptable to the Company for such purpose to sell on Participant s behalf a whole number of Shares otherwise issuable to Participant as the Company determines to be appropriate to generate cash proceeds sufficient to satisfy the applicable Tax Withholding Obligation. Such Shares will be sold on the day such Tax Withholding Obligation arises e.g. , a Vesting Date) or as soon thereafter as practicable. Participant will be responsible for all brokers fees and other costs of sale, and Participant agrees to indemnify and hold the Company harmless from any losses, costs, damages, or expenses relating to any such sale. To the extent the proceeds of such sale exceed the Tax Withholding Obligation, the Company agrees to pay such excess in cash to Participant. Participant acknowledges that the Company is under no obligation to arrange for such sale at any particular price, and that the proceeds of any such sale may not be sufficient to satisfy the Tax Withholding Obligation. Accordingly, Participant agrees to pay to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as soon as practicable, including through additional payroll withholding, any amount of the Tax Withholding Obligation that is not satisfied by the sale of Shares described above. 
 
 (iii) By Check, Wire Transfer or Other Means . At any time not less than five (5) business days (or such fewer number of days as determined by the Committee or its designee) before any Tax Withholding Obligation arises e.g. , a Vesting Date), Participant may request permission to satisfy the Tax Withholding Obligation by check, wire transfer or other means, by submitting such request, in writing, to the Company. Alternatively, the Company may require that Participant satisfy any Tax Withholding Obligation in any such manner. If the Company approves Participant s request, or so requires, within five (5) business days of the relevant Vesting Date (or such fewer number of days as determined by the Committee or its designee) Participant must deliver to the Company the amount that the Company determines is sufficient to satisfy the Tax Withholding Obligation by (x) wire transfer to such account as the Company may direct, (y) delivery of a certified check payable to the Company, or (z) such other means as specified from time to time by the Committee or its designee. 
 
 7. Successors . This Agreement shall (a) inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the Company s successors and assigns, and (b) be binding on Participant s executors, administrators, heirs and successors, in the event that Participant dies and Section 2 of this Agreement applies. Nothing contained in the Plan, the Notice of Award or this Agreement shall be interpreted as imposing any liability on the Company or the Committee in favor of Participant or any purchaser or other transferee of Units or Shares with respect to any loss, cost or expense which such Participant, purchaser or other transferee may incur in connection with, or arising out of any transaction involving, any Units or Shares subject to the Plan, the Notice of Award or this Agreement. 
 
 8. No Compensation Deferrals . This Agreement, the Notice of Award and the Plan are intended to be exempt from or to comply with Section 409A Section 409A of the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and shall be administered and construed in accordance with such intent. The Company reserves the right, to the extent the Company deems necessary or advisable in its sole discretion, unilaterally to amend or modify, or to take any other actions, as the Committee determines are necessary or appropriate with respect to, the Plan, the Notice of Award and or this Agreement to ensure that no awards (including, without limitation, the Units) become subject to the requirements of Section 409A, provided, however, that the Company makes no representation that the Units are not subject to Section 409A nor makes any undertaking to preclude Section 409A from applying to the Units. In furtherance, and not in limitation, of the foregoing (a) in no event may Participant designate, directly or indirectly, the calendar year of any payment to be made hereunder and (b) notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, a termination of Service hereunder shall mean and be interpreted consistent with a separation from service within the meaning of Section 409A with respect to any payment hereunder that constitutes a deferral of compensation under Section 409A that becomes due on account of such separation from service. 
 
 3 

9. Integration . The terms of the Plan, the Notice of Award and this Agreement are intended by the Company and Participant to be the final expression of their agreement with respect to Units and may not be contradicted by evidence of any prior or contemporaneous agreement. The Company and Participant further intend that the Plan, the Notice of Award and this Agreement shall constitute the complete and exclusive statement of their terms and that no extrinsic evidence whatsoever may be introduced in any arbitration, judicial, administrative or other legal proceeding involving the Plan, the Notice of Award or this Agreement. Accordingly, the Plan, the Notice of Award and this Agreement contain the entire understanding between the parties and supersede all prior oral, written and implied agreements, understandings, commitments and practices among the parties. 
 
 10. Waivers . Any failure to enforce any terms or conditions of the Plan, the Notice of Award or this Agreement by the Company or by Participant shall not be deemed a waiver of that term or condition, nor shall any waiver or relinquishment of any right or power for all or any other times. 
 
 11. Severability of Provisions . If any provision of the Plan, the Notice of Award or this Agreement shall be held invalid or unenforceable, such invalidity or unenforceability shall not affect any other provision thereof and the Plan, the Notice of Award and this Agreement shall be construed and enforced as if none of them included such provision. 
 
 12. Committee Decisions Conclusive . This Agreement and the Notice of Award are administered and interpreted by the Committee and the Committee has full and exclusive discretion to interpret and administer this Agreement and the Notice of Award.

 13. Mandatory Direct Discussion, Mediation, and Arbitration . To the extent permitted by law, any claim, disagreement, or dispute arising out of or relating to the Plan, the Notice of Award, and or this Agreement, including the meaning or interpretation thereof (a Dispute ), shall be resolved solely and exclusively by direct discussion and mandatory mediation followed, if necessary, by final and binding arbitration in accordance with the terms and procedures specified in this Section 13. These terms and procedures apply solely to the resolution of a Dispute as defined in this Agreement. Any other claim, issue, or complaint raised by Participant who is subject to the Franklin Templeton Investments Alternative Dispute Resolution Policy and Agreement (the ADR Agreement ), which claims, issues or complaints are not covered by this Agreement will be resolved according to the terms and procedures of the ADR Agreement. With regard to any Dispute as defined in this Agreement, if there is a difference between the terms or procedures defined in the ADR Agreement, and the terms and procedures defined in this Agreement, this Agreement s terms and procedures shall control. Participant and the Company specifically agree to waive the right to pursue any Dispute before a court or jury. 
 (a) Direct Discussion . Upon written notice of any Dispute, Participant and the Company (each referred to as a party and together as the parties shall first attempt to resolve the Dispute by direct discussion. 
 
 (b) Mediation . If a Dispute is not resolved by direct discussion then either party may request mediation of the Dispute by sending a written notice requesting mediation to the other party. The parties will mutually agree to the selection of a mediator, whose compensation will be borne by the Company. 
 
 (c) Arbitration . If a Dispute is not resolved by direct discussion and mandatory mediation, then either party may request final and binding arbitration of the Dispute by sending a written notice requesting arbitration to the other party. The Dispute will be heard by a single arbitrator unless, within 45 days of receiving the initial written demand for arbitration, either party elects by written notice to the other party for the arbitration to be heard by a panel of three arbitrators. If a single arbitrator is used, the parties will mutually agree to the selection of the arbitrator. If either party elects for the arbitration to be heard by a panel of three arbitrators, each party will select one arbitrator, and the arbitrators selected by the parties will, within a reasonable period of time, then appoint a third arbitrator to serve as chair of the panel. 
 
 4 

The arbitration will be conducted in accordance with the Employment Arbitration Rules and Mediation Procedures of the American Arbitration Association AAA as amended and effective November 1, 2009 (the AAA Rules but without necessarily retaining AAA or any other third party to administer the arbitration. The parties will determine whether a third-party administration service is necessary and, if jointly deemed necessary, agree to a mutually acceptable arbitration administration service, whether AAA or otherwise, within 45 days of receipt of the initial written demand for arbitration. If the parties do not agree about whether a third party is needed to administer the arbitration, or if the parties cannot reach agreement as to which administration service to use within 45 days, any arbitration will be administered by AAA. The location for the arbitration shall be in the county or comparable jurisdiction of Participant s Service. Judgment on the award rendered may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. 
 
 The Company will pay all of the costs of arbitration that are attributable to the employer pursuant to the AAA Rules, unless applicable law requires the Company to pay a greater share or all of the costs. In addition, if a single arbitrator is used, or if the Company elects for the arbitration to be heard by a panel of three arbitrators, the compensation and expenses of the arbitrator(s) will be paid by the Company. If Participant elects for the arbitration to be heard by a panel of three arbitrators, Participant will be responsible for paying one-half of the arbitrators compensation and expenses. 
 
 All statutes of limitation that would otherwise be applicable shall apply to any arbitration proceeding under this Section. To the extent permitted by law, Participant waives the right to participate in a class, representative or collective action, as a class representative, class member, as an opt-in party, or private attorney general or join or consolidate claims with claims of any other person or entity, with respect to any Dispute, whether before a court or jury or in arbitration. Nothing in this Agreement, however, is intended or understood to limit, contradict, or preclude the rights reserved by law for Participant to initiate any administrative claim, or to excuse Participant from bringing an administrative claim before any agency in order to fulfill any obligation by Participant to exhaust administrative remedies. The provisions of this Section are intended by Participant and the Company to be exclusive for all purposes and applicable to any and all Disputes. 
 
 Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, or as otherwise mutually agreed by the parties, the arbitrator(s) will conduct the arbitration pursuant to the AAA Rules, the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. section 1, et seq., and the U.S. Federal Rules of Evidence. The arbitrator(s) shall have jurisdiction and authority only to award Participant an amount equal to or less than the amount of the Award challenged in the Dispute, subject to the same terms and conditions as the Notice of Award in Dispute, and shall not have jurisdiction or authority to make any other award of any type, including, without limitation, punitive damages, unforeseeable economic damages, damages for pain, suffering or emotional distress, or any other kind or form of damages (the Arbitrator Authority ). Thus, the arbitrator(s) shall not have jurisdiction or authority to grant preliminary or final injunctive relief or specific performance. The remedy, if any, awarded by the arbitrator(s) within the Arbitrator Authority shall be the sole and exclusive remedy for any Dispute that is subject to arbitration under this Section. 
 
 If Participant is an Associated Person employed by a Member Firm (as each such term is defined by the rules of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority FINRA )), nothing in this Agreement prohibits or restricts Participant or the Member Firm from filing an arbitration claim involving a Dispute in the FINRA arbitration forum as specified in FINRA rules. In such a case, the parties each reserve the right to elect to have the arbitration heard by a panel of three arbitrators regardless of the dollar amount of the claim. The parties further agree that the authority of the arbitrator(s) in any FINRA arbitration of a Dispute is limited to the Arbitrator Authority defined above. Unless otherwise mutually agreed by the parties, the arbitrator(s) will conduct the arbitration pursuant to the FINRA Code of Arbitration Procedure for Industry Disputes (the FINRA Code and the Federal Rules of Evidence. All fees, costs, and expenses of FINRA arbitration, whether a single arbitrator or a panel of arbitrators is selected, including any hearing session fees, arbitration fees, surcharges, and filing fees, will be allocated as specified in the FINRA Code. 
 
 14. Delaware Law . The Plan, the Notice of Award and this Agreement are governed by, and all Disputes arising under or in connection with the Plan, the Notice of Award and this Agreement shall be resolved in accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to its conflict of laws rules, to the extent not pre-empted by the federal laws of the United States of America.

 WHEREAS, the Company has determined that it would be to the advantage and in the interest of the Company and its stockholders to award the Shares (as defined in the Notice of Award) to Participant, subject to certain restrictions, as an incentive for increased efforts and successful achievements. 
 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing premises and of the mutual covenants herein contained, the parties hereto hereby agree as follows 
 1. Defined Terms . Capitalized terms used but not defined in this Agreement (including the Exhibits attached hereto) shall have the same meanings ascribed to such terms in the Notice of Award or the Plan, as applicable. 
 2. Restricted Shares . The Company is issuing to Participant the Shares as set forth in the Notice of Award, subject to the rights of and limitations on Participant as owner thereof as set forth in this Agreement. Such Shares are being issued in book entry form and maintained on the books of Merrill Lynch, the Company s transfer agent, or any successor thereto. All Shares issued hereunder shall be deemed issued to Participant as fully paid and non-assessable shares and, subject to the restrictions set forth in the Plan and this Agreement, Participant shall have all rights of a stockholder with respect thereto, including the right to vote, to receive dividends (including stock dividends), to participate in stock splits or other recapitalizations, and to exchange such Shares in a tender offer, merger, consolidation or other reorganization. Any cash dividend payable with respect to the Shares then-outstanding (whether vested or unvested) will be paid as and when such cash dividend is paid to the Company s stockholders. Participant hereby acknowledges that Participant is acquiring the Shares issued hereunder for investment and not with a view to the distribution thereof, and that Participant does not intend to subdivide Participant s interest in the Shares with any other person. 
 3. Transfer Restriction . No portion of the Shares issued to Participant hereunder shall be sold, transferred by gift, pledged, hypothecated, or otherwise transferred or disposed of by Participant except by will or the laws of descent and distribution provided that no such restrictions shall apply to the Shares after the date on which they become vested pursuant to Section 4. This Section shall not preclude Participant from exchanging the Shares awarded hereunder pursuant to a cash or stock tender offer, merger, reorganization or consolidation. Any securities (including stock dividends and stock splits) received with respect to any portion of the Shares which are not yet vested under Section 4 shall be subject to the provisions of this Agreement in the same manner and shall become fully vested at the same time as the portion of the Shares with respect to which such additional securities were issued. 
 4. Vesting . 
 (a) Participant s interest in the Shares shall become vested and non-forfeitable in accordance with the Vesting Schedule attached hereto as Exhibit A (the Vesting Schedule ), subject to Section 12 below. Upon vesting, the Company shall, within thirty (30) days of such vesting and provided the withholding requirements of Section 5 have been satisfied, deliver to Participant the certificate evidencing the non-forfeitable Share (free of restrictive legends on such stock certificate) or, the Committee may permit or require that such non-forfeitable Shares (free of the restrictive notations on Shares issued in book-entry form) be deposited directly with a brokerage firm or transfer agent determined acceptable to the Company for such purpose or to a designated agent of the Company, and the Committee may utilize electronic or automated methods of share transfer.

 (b) Except as set forth in the Vesting Schedule, if Participant s Continuous Status as an Employee terminates for any reason, all Shares to the extent not yet vested in accordance with the Vesting Schedule on the date Participant s Continuous Status as an Employee terminates shall be forfeited by Participant without payment of any consideration to Participant therefor. Additionally, if any Shares do not vest on the fourth (4 th anniversary of the Closing Date, such unvested Shares shall be forfeited by Participant without payment of any consideration to Participant therefor. Any Shares so forfeited shall be canceled and the Shares that are so forfeited shall be returned to the status of authorized but unissued Shares, to be held for future distributions under the Plan. 
 5. Withholding of Taxes . 
 (a) General . Participant is ultimately liable and responsible for all taxes owed by Participant in connection with the Shares awarded, regardless of any action the Company or any of its Subsidiaries takes with respect to any tax withholding obligations that arise in connection with the Shares awarded. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries makes any representation or undertaking regarding the treatment of any tax withholding in connection with the grant or vesting of the Shares awarded or the subsequent sale of any of the Shares. The Company and its Subsidiaries do not commit and are under no obligation to structure the Shares to reduce or eliminate Participant s tax liability. 
 (b) Payment of Withholding Taxes . Prior to any event in connection with the Shares awarded that the Company determines may result in any tax withholding obligation, whether United States federal, state or local taxes or any applicable foreign taxes and including any employment tax obligation (the Tax Withholding Obligation ), Participant must agree to the satisfaction of such Tax Withholding Obligation in a manner acceptable to the Company, including by one of the following methods 
 (i) By Share Withholding. Unless the Company permits Participant to satisfy the Tax Withholding Obligation by some other means in accordance with clause (iii) below, Participant authorizes the Company (in the exercise of its sole discretion) to withhold from those unrestricted Shares to be delivered to Participant upon vesting in accordance with the Vesting Schedule the whole number of Shares sufficient to satisfy the Tax Withholding Obligation. Share withholding in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence will result in the delivery of a lower number of unrestricted Shares to Participant. Share withholding will generally be used to satisfy the tax liability of individuals subject to the short-swing profit restrictions of Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act. 
 (ii) By Sale of Shares . Unless the Company permits Participant to satisfy the Tax Withholding Obligation by some other means in accordance with clause (iii) below, and provided that the terms of this clause (ii) do not violate Section 13(k) of the Exchange Act, Participant s acceptance of the Shares awarded constitutes Participant s instruction and authorization to the Company and any brokerage firm determined acceptable to the Company for such purpose to sell on Participant s behalf a whole number of shares from those unrestricted Shares to be delivered to Participant upon vesting in accordance with the Vesting Schedule as the Company determines to be appropriate to generate cash proceeds sufficient to satisfy the applicable Tax Withholding Obligation. Such Shares will be sold on the day such Tax Withholding Obligation arises or as soon thereafter as administratively practicable. Participant will be responsible for all brokers fees and other costs of sale, and Participant agrees to indemnify and hold the Company harmless from any losses, costs, damages, or expenses relating to any such sale. To the extent the proceeds of such sale exceed the Tax Withholding Obligation, the Company agrees to pay such excess in cash to Participant. Participant acknowledges that the Company is under no obligation to arrange for such sale at any particular price, and that the proceeds of any such sale may not be sufficient to satisfy the Tax Withholding Obligation. Accordingly, Participant agrees to pay to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as soon as practicable, including through additional payroll withholding, any amount of the Tax Withholding Obligation that is not satisfied by the sale of Shares described above. 
 (iii) By Check, Wire Transfer or Other Means . At any time not less than five (5) business days (or such fewer number of days as determined by the Committee or its designee) before any Tax Withholding Obligation arises, Participant may request permission to satisfy the Tax Withholding Obligation by check, wire transfer or other means, by submitting such request, in writing, to the Company. Alternatively, the Company may require that Participant satisfy any Tax Withholding Obligation in any such manner. If the Company approves Participant s request, or so requires, within five (5) business days of the applicable vesting date of the Shares (or such fewer number of days as determined by the Committee or its designee) Participant must deliver to the Company the amount that the Company determines is sufficient to satisfy the Tax Withholding Obligation by (x) wire transfer to such account as the Company may direct, (y) delivery of a certified check payable to the Company, or (z) such other means as specified from time to time by the Committee or its designee.

This Agreement shall (a) inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the Company s successors and assigns, and (b) be binding on Participant s executors, administrators, heirs and successors, in the event that Participant dies and Section 3 of this Agreement applies. Nothing contained in the Plan, the Notice of Award or this Agreement shall be interpreted as imposing any liability on the Company or the Committee in favor of Participant or any purchaser or other transferee of Shares with respect to any loss, cost or expense which such Participant, purchaser or other transferee may incur in connection with, or arising out of any transaction involving, any Shares subject to the Plan, the Notice of Award or this Agreement. 
 8. Integration . The terms of the Plan, the Notice of Award and this Agreement are intended by the Company and Participant to be the final expression of their agreement with respect to the Shares and may not be contradicted by evidence of any prior or contemporaneous agreement. The Company and Participant further intend that the Plan, the Notice of Award and this Agreement shall constitute the complete and exclusive statement of their terms and that no extrinsic evidence whatsoever may be introduced in any arbitration, judicial, administrative or other legal proceeding involving the Plan, the Notice of Award or this Agreement.

Participant understands and acknowledges that the Shares granted hereunder are made in full satisfaction to grant the Performance Stock Grant (as defined in the Affiliate Letter) to Participant under the Affiliate Letter, and the Company shall have no further obligation under the Affiliate Letter with respect to the Performance Stock Grant. 
 9. Waivers . Any failure to enforce any terms or conditions of the Plan, the Notice of Award or this Agreement by the Company or by Participant shall not be deemed a waiver of that term or condition, nor shall any waiver or relinquishment of any right or power for all or any other times.

 (a) Forfeiture Pursuant to Restatement of Financial Results . Notwithstanding anything in the Award to the contrary, in the event that (i) the Company issues a restatement of financial results to correct a material error (ii) the Committee determines, in good faith, that fraud or willful misconduct by Participant was a significant contributing factor to the need to issue such restatement and (iii) some or all of the shares of Stock that were granted and or other property earned prior to such restatement by Participant would not have been granted and or earned, as applicable, based upon the restated financial results, Participant shall immediately return to the Company those shares of Stock, property received with respect to those shares of Stock, including any cash dividends paid with respect to those shares of Stock, any pre-tax income derived from ownership and any gross proceeds from disposition of such Stock and property, that would not have been granted and or earned based upon the restated financial results (the Repayment Obligation ), and all such shares of Stock (whether or not vested) shall immediately be forfeited. The Company shall be able to enforce the Repayment Obligation by all legal means available, including, without limitation, by withholding such amount from other sums and property owed by the Company to Participant.
