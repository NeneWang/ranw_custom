ITEM
1. BUSINESS. 

General 

Hartford
Great Health Corp. the Company , Hartford we , us or our was incorporated
in the State of Nevada on April 2, 2008 Inception) under the name PhotoAmigo, Inc. It changed its name to Hartford Great Health
Corp. on August 20, 2018, and since then we have been engaged in activities to formulate and implement our business plan as set forth
below. 

Overview 

Up
until August 2018, we provided social networking and photo sharing from the website PhotoAmigo.com. We also maintained the domain names
PhotoAmigo.net, fotoamigo.com and fotoamigo.net. These domain names all redirect incoming traffic to our main website, PhotoAmigo.com. 

In
August 2018, the Company changed its future plans of operations. Through its wholly owned subsidiary - Hangzhou Hartford Comprehensive
Health Management, Ltd HZHF) and HZHF s 60 percent owned subsidiary - Hangzhou Longjing Qiao Fu Vacation Hotel Co., Ltd. HZLJ ), and through Shanghai Hartford Comprehensive Health Management, Ltd. HFSH and its 90 percent owned
subsidiary - Shanghai Qiao Garden International Travel Agency Qiao Garden Int l Travel ), the Company engages in
hospitality industry in China. Qiao Garden Int l Travel was disposed on December 31, 2020, see note 4 Acquisitions, Joint Ventures
and Deconsolidation. 

The
Company started to engage in early childhood education industry at Hartford International Education Technology Co., Ltd HF Int l
Education ), a 75.5 ownership subsidiary of HFSH in March 2019. On July 24, 2019 and March 23, 2020, HF Int l Education
established two 100 owned subsidiaries, Pudong Haojin Childhood Education Ltd. PDHJ and Shanghai Hongkou HaiDeFuDe Childcare
Co., Ltd.( HDFD ), respectively, to operate the early childhood education service under the brand name of HaiDeFuDe 
in Shanghai, China. On July 20, 2020, HF Int l Education entered an agreement with two individuals to acquire the whole ownership
of Shanghai Gelinke Childcare Education Center Gelinke ). 

In
March 2021, HF Int l Education entered agreements with a third party, Hartford Health Management (Shanghai), Co. Ltd. HFHM ).
HFHM purchased seven education intellectual property copy rights and ten HaiDeFuDe registered trademarks from HF
Int l Education for a total amount of RMB1.2M and RMB1.0M, respectively. As a part of the purchase agreement, HFHM will be paid
the 90 of gross tuition income from the three childcare centers. During the board meeting, SH Jingyu and another noncontrolling shareholders
also sold a total of 14.5 equity at zero value to HFSH. As a result, HFSH holds 90 of HF Int l Education and a total of 10 equity
is held by two other noncontrolling shareholders. 

The
following business plan is based on research and discussions between the board and third party suppliers and experts. Only preliminary
activities relating to the following objectives have been undertaken and therefore, there is no assurance that any of the proposed activities
set forth below will be started by the Company or if started will be successful. 

Strategy 

The
initial plan focuses on the development of the Sino-U.S. health industry in the following four areas: 

A.
International Anti-Aging Membership Program, 

 B.
Artificial Intelligence and Medical Equipment Sales, 

 C.
Mobile Lifestyle Health Wellness Management Platform, 

 D.
Integrated Health Management of Metabolic Diseases. 

4 

The
Company has also expanded its strategy into the hospitality industry, focusing on hotels, restaurants, and travel arrangements. The Company
plans to integrate hospitality with health management through its membership-based program by arranging travel accommodations for Chinese
citizen members to the United States to obtain stem cell beauty treatments. 

The
initial plan in early 2019 that focused on the development of the Sino-U.S. health industry in the areas of International Anti-Aging
membership based program; Artificial Intelligence and Medical Equipment Sales; Mobile Lifestyle Management Platform; and Integrated management
of metabolic diseases have been put on hold due to economic uncertainties caused by the increasing tension between the US and China international
relation. 

Near
the end of 2019, the Company has found another opportunity to expand its market reach in the Chinese childhood education industry. The
Company plans to formulate a proprietary early childhood education center management model beginning with the opening of several early
childhood education centers in the greater Shanghai area with the goal of demonstrating the management model in action in order to attract
interest from potential franchisees. Currently, there are three early child education and development center in operation despite the
economic slowdown during the pandemic. The recent Three-child policy announced on May 1, 2021, by Chinese government further
increases the market opportunities in early childhood education industry. On July 24, 2021, the Chinese government announced a Double-Reduction 
education policy to be taken effective on August 31, 2021. This new education policy has since impacted the Company s early childhood
education business. In the short future, the Company is optimistic on the increasing demand for childcare and childhood education; therefore,
the Company will remain focus mainly on childcare and childhood educational development industry. 

There
can be no assurance following consummation of any of the business ventures will develop into a going concern or, if the business is already
operating, that it will continue to operate successfully. Many of the potential business opportunities available to the Company may involve
new and untested products, processes or market strategies which may not ultimately prove successful. 

The
Company s independent auditors have issued a report raising substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as
a going concern. At present, the Company has limited operations and the continuation of the Company as a going concern is dependent upon
financial support from its stockholders, its ability to obtain necessary equity financing to continue operations and/or to successfully
locate and negotiate with a business entity for the combination of that target company with the Company. There is no assurance that the
Company will ever be profitable. 

Competition 

We
believe there are only limited barriers to entry in our business. With regards to the education industry, the Company carefully selected
to invest in a business with established expertise and knowledge of the early childhood education industry in China. The Company recognizes
that there are numerous childcare centers throughout China; however, these centers lack standard curriculums for educating children and
many fall into the designation of daycares rather than education centers. As such, the Company s interests with regards to early
childhood education mainly relate to creating a nationwide standardized curriculum to be implemented throughout all of China which is
an idea that faces little competition as it has remained unexplored by other childcare businesses. To successfully compete in our industries,
we will need to: 

Ensure
 that investments in our projects are affordable; 

That
 our investment strategy is simple to understand; and 

That
 we provide outstanding customer service and rigid integrity in our business dealings. 

However,
there can be no assurance that even if we do these things, we will be able to compete effectively with the other companies in our industry.
We believe that we have the required management expertise in sourcing properties with good development potential and affordable price.
We are committed to work and communicate with our investors and sales consultants to identify their goals and needs which will make it
easier to continually provide them with the best products and services.

None. 

ITEM
2. PROPERTIES 

Hartford
Great Health Corp. uses the offices of its Chief Executive Officer, at 8832 Glendon Way, Rosemead, CA 91770, for its minimal office facility
needs for no consideration. 

Each
newly acquired or formed entity maintains its own leased office building and property. We lease spaces in Shanghai and Hangzhou, China
under leases that expire at various times between 2023 and 2051 with various term extensions available. 

We
lease all of our facilities and do not own any real property. 

ITEM
3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 

On
April 13, 2020, HFSH and HF Int l Education received Notices of Lease Termination from the sub-lessor. HFSH and HF International
Education then filed a civil case against the sub-lessor for return the over-charged rent expense because of fictitious office size,
approximately 483,000 (RMB3.3 million). The sublease agreement was terminated on June 1, 2020. HF International Education entered a
new lease agreement with the original landlord on June 1, 2020. On July 7, 2021, the district court announced the ruling and awarded
HFSH a total amount of RMB870,336 to be returned by the sub-lessor, Shanghai Longjin Management and awarded HF International Education
a total amount of RMB268,450 to be returned by the same sub-lessor. However, the rental deposits in the amount of RMB313,286 paid to
the sub-lessor are non-refundable. No further appeal on these rental dispute cases will be granted. These final ruling proceedings are
pending execution by the district court. 

We
were not subject to any other legal proceedings during the twelve months ended July 31, 2021, and are not currently subject to any legal
proceedings, and to the best of our knowledge, no such proceeding is threatened, the results of which would have a material impact on
our results of operation or financial condition. Nor, to the best of our knowledge, are any of our officers or directors involved in
any legal proceedings in which we are an adverse party.

ITEM
5. MARKET FOR COMMON EQUITY. RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES 

Market
Information 

There
has only been limited trading for the Company s Common Stock since it was quoted on OTC Markets. There is no assurance that an
active trading market will ever develop or, if such a market does develop, that it will continue. The Securities and Exchange Commission
has adopted Rule 15g-9 which establishes the definition of a penny stock, for purposes relevant to the Company, as any
equity security that has a market price of less than 5.00 per share or with an exercise price of less than 5.00 per share, subject
to certain exceptions. For any transaction involving a penny stock, unless exempt, the rules require: (i) that a broker or dealer approve
a person s account for transactions in penny stocks and (ii) the broker or dealer receive from the investor a written agreement
to the transaction, setting forth the identity and quantity of the penny stock to be purchased. In order to approve a person s
account for transactions in penny stocks, the broker or dealer must (i) obtain financial information and investment experience and objectives
of the person and (ii) make a reasonable determination that the transactions in penny stocks are suitable for that person and that person
has sufficient knowledge and experience in financial matters to be capable of evaluating the risks of transactions in penny stocks. The
broker or dealer must also deliver, prior to any transaction in a penny stock, a disclosure schedule prepared by the Commission relating
to the penny stock market, which, in highlight form, (i) sets forth the basis on which the broker or dealer made the suitability determination
and (ii) that the broker or dealer received a signed, written agreement from the investor prior to the transaction. Disclosure also has
to be made about the risks of investing in penny stocks in both public offerings and in secondary trading, and about commissions payable
to both the broker-dealer and the registered representative, current quotations for the securities and the rights and remedies available
to an investor in cases of fraud in penny stock transactions. Finally, monthly statements have to be sent disclosing recent price information
for the penny stock held in the account and information on the limited market in penny stocks. 

Because
of these regulations, broker-dealers may encounter difficulties in their attempt to buy or sell shares of our common stock, which may
affect the ability of our shareholders to sell their shares in the secondary market and have the effect of reducing the level of trading
activity in the secondary market. These additional sales practice and disclosure requirements could impede the sale of our common stock
in the market place. In addition, the liquidity for our common stock may be decreased, with a corresponding decrease in the price of
our common stock. Our shares are likely to be subject to such penny stock rules for the foreseeable future. 

On
October 29, 2021, the closing price of our common stock reported on the OTC Markets was 0.16 per share. The following table sets forth,
for each of the quarterly periods indicated, the high and low sales prices of our common stock, as reported on the OTC Markets.

Penny
Stock Rules 

Due
to the price of our common stock, as well as the fact that we are not listed on Nasdaq or a national securities exchange, our stock is
characterized as penny stocks under applicable securities regulations. Our stock will therefore be subject to rules adopted
by the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC regulating broker-dealer practices in connection with transactions in penny
stocks. The broker or dealer proposing to affect a transaction in a penny stock must furnish his customer a document containing information
prescribed by the SEC and obtain from the customer an executed acknowledgment of receipt of that document. The broker or dealer must
also provide the customer with pricing information regarding the security prior to the transaction and with the written confirmation
of the transaction. The broker or dealer must also disclose the aggregate amount of any compensation received or receivable by him in
connection with such transaction prior to consummating the transaction and with the written confirmation of the trade. The broker or
dealer must also send an account statement to each customer for which he has executed a transaction in a penny stock each month in which
such security is held for the customer s account. The existence of these rules may have an effect on the price of our stock, and
the willingness of certain brokers to effect transactions in our stock. 

Transfer
Agent 

We
have appointed EQ by Equiniti, as the transfer agent for our common stock. The principal office of EQ is located at 1110 Centre Pointe
Curve #101, Mendota Heights, MN 55120 and its telephone number is (612) 209-9006. 

Dividend
Policy 

We
have never declared or paid dividends on our common stock. Payment of future dividends, if any, will be at the discretion of our Board
of Directors after taking into account various factors, including the terms of any credit arrangements, our financial condition, operating
results, current and anticipated cash needs and plans for expansion. At the present time, we intend to retain any earning in our business,
and therefore do not anticipate paying dividends in the foreseeable future. 

Recent
Sales of Unregistered Securities; Use of Proceeds from Unregistered Securities 

On
December 11, 2018, the Company sold 96,090,000 shares of its common stock (the Shares to 15 individuals. The selling price
was 0.02 per share for an aggregate of 1,921,800. All 15 investors executed subscription agreements and all proceeds have been collected.
Twelve of the 15 investors are Chinese citizens and purchased the shares in China. Due to the strict monitoring of China s foreign
exchange investment policy, funds are not able to be transferred directly to HFUS. As a result, amount of 657,000 were collected in
RMB from the Chinese investors. The Shares were sold in a private placement pursuant to an exemption from registration in accordance
with Section 4(2) and/or Regulation S under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The Shares are all restricted shares and accordingly
all stock certificates evidencing the Shares have been affixed with the appropriate legend restricting sales and transfers. The proceeds
from the sales of securities have been used in operating activities and acquisition of new entities. 

On
July 3, 2020, the Company signed a subscription agreement to one of the existing investors selling 1,000,000 shares of common stock (the
 Shares priced at 0.02 per share. The shares were issued on November 24, 2020.

HF Int l Education has recruited a team of knowledgeable childcare teachers to develop series of independent textbooks designed
to targeted age of young children and register for the copyrights for these textbooks in September of 2020. Since then, HF Int l
Education has begun marketing and promoting the enhanced model of franchise operation and management packaged program, under HaiDeFuDe 
brand, to an initial of 50 franchisees throughout different regions of China. To achieve that, HF Int l Education has incorporated
existing market resources throughout other major cities and provinces in China. The promotion of HF Int l Education franchise operation
and management model is expected to attract other childcare education centers to join the HaiDeFuDe brand, and HF Int l
Education expects to generate revenue from franchise and management fees.

Due
to continued market uncertainties during the pandemic, the board of HFSH adopted a new management approach to ease cash flow and reduce
operation loss. In March 2021, HF Int l Education entered agreements with a third party, Hartford Health Management (Shanghai),
Co. Ltd. HFHM ). HFHM purchased seven education intellectual property copy rights and ten HaiDeFuDe 
registered trademarks from HF Int l Education for a total amount of RMB1.2M and RMB1.0M, respectively. In June 2021, HF Int l
Education and its three subsidiaries entered license agreements with HFHM for the rights to use the intellectual Properties (the IPs HFHM owns. The IPs cover in the license agreements are four sets of curriculum structure designed and fifteen trademarks including HaiDeFuDe 
registered trademarks purchased from HF Int l Education. As a return, on a monthly basis, HF Int l Education and its subsidiaries
pays 90 of its tuition revenue generated to HFHM as license usage fee. 

After
further ease of restrictions from the pandemic, the Company will re-run special franchise promotion. There will be a great reduction
in franchise fees for the first twenty childcare center that join HaiDeFuDe brand. In doing so, the Company expect to generate
a revised revenue of RMB16,000,000 from 50 franchisees by the end of 2022. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

As
of July 31, 2021, we had negative working capital of 6,927,145 comprised of current assets of 990,088 and current liabilities of 7,917,233.
This represents a decrease of 3,567,522 in the working capital balance from the July 31, 2020 negative amount of 3,359,623. During
the year-ended July 31, 2021, our working capital deficit increased primarily because we recognized 2,508,959 current operating
lease liabilities by adopting ASU No. 2016-02, and additional advances from related parties for business operating. 

We
believe that our funding requirements for the next twelve months will be in excess of 1,600,000. We are currently seeking for further
funding through related parties loan and finance. 

On
December 11, 2018, the Company sold 96,090,000 shares of its common stock (the Shares to 15 individuals. The selling price
was 0.02 per share for an aggregate of 1,921,800. All 15 investors executed subscription agreements. As of April 30, 2019, all proceeds
have collected. Twelve of the 15 investors are Chinese citizens and purchased the shares in China. Due to the strict monitoring of China s
foreign exchange investment policy, funds are not able to be transferred directly to HFUS. As a result, amount of 657,000 were collected
in RMB from the Chinese investors. The Shares were sold in a private placement pursuant to an exemption from registration in accordance
with Section 4(2) and/or Regulation S under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The Shares are all restricted shares and accordingly
all stock certificates evidencing the Shares have been affixed with the appropriate legend restricting sales and transfers. 

On
November 24, 2020, the Company issued additional 1,000,000 shares of common stock to a significant shareholder of the Company at 0.02
per share. 

We
will seek additional financing in the form of debt or equity. There is no assurance that we will be able to obtain any needed financing
on favorable terms, or at all, or that we will find qualified purchasers for the sale of our stock. Any sales of our securities would
dilute the ownership of our existing investors.

Investing
activities 

Cash
used in investing activities was 185,682 for the year ended July 31, 2021 as compared to 52,270 cash provided by investing activities
for the corresponding period in 2020. 

During
the year ended July 31, 2021, HF Int l Education acquired a new entity, Gelinke with cash net inflow of 12,721, HFSH disposed
its 90 percent owned subsidiary - Qiao Garden Int l Travel with cash net outflow of 30,116, and Property and equipment purchases
of 168,287. 

During
the year ended July 31, 2020, 323,078 loan receivable and interest have been paid back from third party borrowers. HF Int l Education s
subsidiary, Pudong Haojin Childhood Education Ltd. PDHJ was opened to provide childcare education services. Property
and equipment, amount of 270,808, have been added to this new entity. 

Financing
activities 

Cash
provided by financing activities was 2,549,984 for the year ended July 31, 2021 as compared to 1,117,796 for the year ended July 31,
2020. The cash flows provided by financing activities for the year ended July 31, 2021 was primarily attributable to 2,407,033 funding
support from related parties, 145,000 notes payable from one related party, 20,000 proceeds from stock issuance, offset by 22,049
finance lease principal payment. 

The

the joint venture entity - HF Int l, offset by 19,878 finance lease principal payment. 

Equity
and Capital Resources 

We
have incurred losses since inception of our business and, as of July 31, 2021, we had an accumulated deficit of 5,821,519 compared to
 3,568,185 at the previous year end. To date, we have funded our operations through short-term debt and equity financing. 

We
expect our expenses might increase during the foreseeable future as a result of increased operational expenses and the development of
our business. As our Chinese subsidiaries start operations and marketing plans, the three childcare education centers have begun to generate
limited revenues during the pandemic. However, the generated revenue is not expected to be sufficient to cover our marketing needs until
the end of 2022 due to the uncertainties affected by the pandemic. Consequently, we are dependent on the proceeds from future debt or
equity investments to sustain our operations and implement our business plan. If we are unable to raise sufficient capital, we will be
required to delay or forego some portion of our business plan, which would have a material adverse effect on our anticipated results
from operations and financial condition. There is no assurance that we will be able to obtain necessary amounts of additional capital
or that our estimates of our capital requirements will prove to be accurate. 

Future
Capital Expenditures 

On
January 2019, HFSH entered an agreement to acquire 100 percent equity interest of Shanghai Luo Sheng International Trade Ltd. SH
Luosheng ). As of July 31, 2021, the agreement has not yet taken effective as no consideration has been paid toward those acquisitions.
The agreement will be executed when the Company is financially ready to move forward, and the purchase price will be calculated based
on the net assets of each entity on execute dates. There was no penalty levied or to be levied due to delayed execution or inexecution
of this agreement.

Results
of Operations- Year Ended July 31, 2021 Compared to Year Ended July 31, 2020 

Revenue
and Cost of revenue: We recognized 553,459 and 98,307 revenue in the year ended July 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Cost
of revenue increased to 308,413 for the year ended July 31, 2021, compared to 86,243 during the comparable period of 2020. The revenue
during both years was mainly generated from two industry segments: hospitality housing in HZLJ and childhood education care services
in HF Int l Education. 

Operating
Expenses: Operating expenses decreased to 3,261,411 for the year ended July 31, 2021, compared to 3,511,021 during the comparable
period of 2020. During the year ended July 31, 2021, the decrease of 249,610 was resulted from the decrease of impairment loss by 1,557,792,
offset by the increase of the selling, general and administrative expenses by 1,293,020 and the increase of depreciation and amortization
expenses by 15,162. The increase of selling, general and administrative expenses was mainly resulted from the expenses incurred in the
new operating subsidiaries in China for childcare education business development, including lease cost. The company s major business
plans were halted during COVID-19 pandemic. Management determined that 1,006,343 goodwill and 621,963 deferred cost of finance lease
which were generated from acquisitions were fully impaired as of July 31, 2020. Management further determined that 70,514 goodwill generated
from Gelinke acquisition was fully impaired as of July 31, 2021. 

Other
Income (Expense): Other income, net increased to 174,826 for the year ended July 31, 2021, compared to 155,312 of other expense
for the corresponding period of 2020. Other income for the year ended July 31, 2021 was mainly resulted from 108,366 lease payable write-off
as a result of the legal settlement (see note 16. Commitments and contingencies), 104,317 gain on disposal of subsidiary, 334,537 income
realized from the trademark and copy rights transfer to a related party, offset by 403,131 loss from HF Int l Education s
ownership restructure in 2021 (see note 4 Acquisitions, Joint Ventures and Deconsolidation). Other expense for the year ended July 31,
2020, was mainly resulted from 141,984 donation made to Shanghai JiaoTong University Oversea Early Childcare Organization. 

Net
Loss Attributable to Noncontrolling Interest: For the year ended July 31, 2021, we recorded a net loss attributable to Noncontrolling
interest of 589,005 compared to 1,003,700 for the corresponding period of 2020. The decrease was mainly resulted from HF Int l
Education s ownership restructure, noncontrolling interest has been reduced from 24.5 to 10 in 2021. The loss was allocated based
on the ownership percentage of noncontrolling interest, which was mainly acquired through the acquisitions and Joint Ventures. 

Net
Loss Attributable to Hartford Great Health Corp: We recorded a net loss of 2,253,334 or (0.02) per share for the year ended
July 31, 2021, compared to a net loss of 2,651,369 or (0.03) per share for the year ended July 31, 2020, a decrease in losses of 398,035
due to the factors discussed above.

CRITICAL
ACCOUNTING POLICIES 

Use
of Estimates: The preparation of financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires the Company s management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of assets and liabilities, the identification and disclosure of impaired assets and
contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period. Actual
results could differ from those estimates. 

Foreign
Currency: The accounts of the Company s foreign subsidiaries are translated in accordance with FASB ASC 830. Foreign currency
transaction gains and losses are recognized in other expense, net, at the time they occur. Net foreign currency exchange gains or losses
resulting from the translation of assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar are
recorded as a part of accumulated other comprehensive loss in stockholders equity. The Company does not undertake hedging transactions
to cover its foreign currency exposure. 

Comprehensive
Income (loss): For the year ended July 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company included its foreign currency translation gain or loss as part
of its comprehensive income (loss). 

Fair
value measurement : Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability
(an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants
on the measurement date. Valuation techniques used to measure fair value must maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the
use of unobservable inputs. Accounting Standard Codification ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures ASC
820 ), describes a fair value hierarchy based on three levels of inputs, of which the first two are considered observable and the
last unobservable, that may be used to measure fair value, which are the following: 

Level
1 - Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities or funds. 

 Level
2 - Inputs other than Level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities;
quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for
substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. 

 Level
3 - Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or
liabilities. 

The
Company s financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, related party receivable, prepaid and
other current receivable, accounts payable, related party payable and other current payable. The carrying amounts of afore-mentioned
accounts approximate fair value because of their short-term nature. 

Cash
and Cash Equivalents: The Company maintains cash with banks in the USA and China. Should any bank holding cash become insolvent,
or if the Company is otherwise unable to withdraw funds, the Company would lose the cash with that bank; however, the Company has not
experienced any losses in such accounts and believes it is not exposed to any significant risks on its cash in bank accounts. In China,
a depositor has up to RMB500,000 insured by the People s Bank of China Financial Stability Bureau FSD ). In the United
States, the standard insurance amount is USD250,000 per depositor in a bank insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation FDIC ).
Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to significant concentrations of credit risk are cash and cash equivalents
and accounts receivable. As of July 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, none of the Company s cash and cash equivalents held by financial
institutions was uninsured. With respect to accounts receivable, the Company generally does not require collateral and does not have
an allowance for doubtful accounts. 

Receivables:
 The Company evaluates the collectability of its receivables based on a number of factors. In circumstances where the Company becomes
aware of a specific customer s or borrower s inability to meet its financial obligations to the Company, a specific reserve
for bad debts is estimated and recorded, which reduces the recognized receivable to the estimated amount the Company believes will ultimately
be collected. As of July 31, 2021 and 2020, all balances are collectable based on management s assessment. 

Property
and equipment, net: Property and equipment, net, are stated at cost. Depreciation and amortization are computed using the straight-line
method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. The estimated useful lives of property and equipment are as follows: 

Years 
 
 Leasehold
 improvements

Goodwill
and Long-lived Assets: Goodwill, which represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net assets
acquired, is not amortized, in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 350, Intangibles Goodwill and Other. ASC
350 requires that goodwill be tested for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis and between annual tests, if an event
occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. These
events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate, legal factors, operating performance indicators,
competition, or sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit. 

The
Company has the option to assess goodwill for possible impairment by performing a qualitative analysis to determine whether the existence
of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than
its carrying amount. A quantitative assessment is performed if the qualitative assessment results in a more-likely-than-not determination
or if a qualitative assessment is not performed. The quantitative assessment considers whether the carrying amount of a reporting unit
exceeds its fair value, in which case an impairment charge is recorded to the extent that the reporting unit s carrying value exceeds
its fair value. The Company s goodwill was mainly generated from the acquisitions during the year ended July 31, 2019. We currently
have two reporting units - Hospitality and Early Childhood Education. Given the impact of COVID-19 pandemic and the unfavorable operation
results, an interim goodwill impairment assessment was performed as of January 31, 2020. Based on the assessment result, management determined
that the goodwill generated from 2019 acquisitions was fully impaired as of January 31, 2020. The goodwill balance as of July 31, 2021
was generated from Gelinke acquisition in 2021. 

Business
Combinations: If an acquired set of activities and assets is capable of being operated as a business consisting of inputs and processes
from the viewpoint of a market participant, the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are a business. Business combinations are accounted
for using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires an acquirer to recognize the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed
at the acquisition date measured at their fair values as of that date. Fair value determinations are based on discounted cash flow analyses
or other valuation techniques. In determining the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a material acquisition,
the Company may utilize appraisals from third party valuation firms to determine fair values of some or all of the assets acquired and
liabilities assumed, or may complete some or all of the valuations internally. In either case, the Company takes full responsibility
for the determination of the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The value of goodwill reflects the excess of
the fair value of the consideration conveyed to the seller over the fair value of the net assets received. Acquisition-related costs
that the Company incurs to affect a business combination are expensed in the periods in which the costs are incurred. 

Noncontrolling
interest: The Company adopted ASC 810, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements an Amendment of Accounting
Research Bulletin No. 51, as of January 1, 2009. ASC 810 establishes accounting and reporting standards for ownership interests in subsidiaries
held by parties other than the parent, the amount of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and to the noncontrolling interest,
changes in a parent s ownership interest and the valuation of retained noncontrolling equity investments when a subsidiary is deconsolidated.
ASC 810 also establishes reporting requirements that provide sufficient disclosures that clearly identify and distinguish between the
interest of the parent and the interests of the noncontrolling owner. 

Advertising
costs: Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. During the year ended July 31, 2021 and 2020, amount of 65,406 and 12,582 advertising
expenses were incurred, respectively. 

Income
Taxes: The Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method in accordance with ASC 740, Accounting for Income
Taxes. The asset and liability method provides that deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences
of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for operating loss and tax credit
carry forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect
when the differences are expected to reverse. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that
is believed more likely than not to be realized. 

On
December 22, 2017, the President of the United States signed into law the Tax Reform Act. The Tax Reform Act permanently reduces the
U.S. corporate income tax rate from a maximum of 35 to a flat 21 rate, effective January 1, 2018. In addition, the 2017 Tax Act also
creates a new requirement that certain income (i.e., Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income GILTI )) earned by controlled foreign
corporations CFCs must be included in the gross income of the CFCs U.S. shareholder income. The tax law in PRC
applies an income tax rate of 25 to all enterprises. The Company s subsidiary does not receive any preferential tax treatment
from local government. The Company has been in loss position for years and zero balances of tax provisions, deferred tax assets and liabilities
as of the reporting periods ended. The tax reforms have no significant impacts on the Company. 

Revenue
Recognition: The Company adopted ASC Topic 606 Revenue from Contracts with Customers Topic 606) on August 1, 2019, applying
the modified retrospective method to all contracts that were not completed as of August 1, 2019. The Company is building up its core
business upon the completion of multiple acquisitions in March 2019 and impact of COVID-19 pandemic, limited operations occurred
during the years ended July 31, 2021and 2020. The revenue during the year ended July 31, 2021 and 2020 was mainly generated from HZLJ
and HF Int l Education. 

14 

Revenue
is recognized when control of promised goods or services is transferred to our customers in an amount of consideration to which we expect
to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. We follow the five steps approach for revenue recognition under Topic 606:
(i) identify the contract(s) with a customer, (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract, (iii) determine the transaction
price, (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract, and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) we
satisfy a performance obligation. Billings to customers for which services are not rendered are considered deferred revenue. ASC 606
has no material impacts on the Company s financial positions. The Company s revenue is recognized when it satisfies a single
performance obligation by transferring control of its products or providing services to a customer. The Company s general payment
terms are short-term in duration. The Company does not have significant financing components or payment terms. 

a. 
 Early
 childhood education services: HF Int l Education generates revenue from childhood education classes provided to its customers.
 The educational services consist of parent-child and bilingual childcare classes. Each contract of educational classes is accounted
 for as a single performance obligation which is satisfied proportionately over the service period. Tuition fee is generally collected
 in advance and is initially recorded as deferred revenue and transferred to contract liabilities after trial period. Refunds are
 provided to parents if they decide within the trial period that they no longer want to take the class. After the trial period, if
 a parent withdraws from a class, usually only that unearned portion of the fee is available to be returned. For the year ended July
 31, 2021 and 2020, 435,150 and 29,582, respectively, of revenue were derived from early childhood education classes provided. 

b. 
 Hospitality
 services: HZLJ generates revenue primarily from the room rentals, sale of food and beverage and other miscellaneous hospitality services.
 The Company recognizes room rental and services daily as services are provided. Under ASC 606, the pattern and timing of recognition
 of income from hotel facility is consistent with the prior accounting model. 

Income
(Loss) Per Share: Basic earnings per share include no dilution and are computed by dividing net income (or loss) by the weighted-
average number of shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share reflect the potential dilution of securities that
could share in the earnings of the Company, assuming the issuance of an equivalent number of common shares pursuant to options, warrants,
or convertible debt arrangements. Diluted earnings per share are not shown for periods in which the Company incurs a loss because it
would be anti-dilutive. Similarly, potential common stock equivalents are not included in the calculation if the effect would be anti-dilutive.
No potentially dilutive debt or equity securities were issued or outstanding during the year ended July 31, 2021 or 2020. 

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements. 

Recently
adopted accounting pronouncements 

In
January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04, Intangibles and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment ,
which eliminates the requirement to calculate the implied fair value of goodwill, but rather requires an entity to record an impairment
charge based on the excess of a reporting unit s carrying value over its fair value. This amendment is effective for annual or
interim goodwill impairment tests in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption is permitted. The Company early adopted
ASU No. 2017-04 on January 31, 2020. Management determined the goodwill generated from HZLJ and HFSH acquisition was fully impaired as
of January 31, 2020. 

15 

In
February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) . ASU No. 2016-02 requires the recognition of lease assets
and lease liabilities on the balance sheet for leases classified as operating leases under previous guidance. The accounting for finance
leases (capital leases) was substantially unchanged. The original guidance required application on a modified retrospective basis with
adjustments to the earliest comparative period presented. In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-11, Targeted Improvements
to ASC 842, which included an option to not restate comparative periods in transition and elect to use the effective date of ASU
No. 2016-02 as the date of initial application, which the Company elected. As a result, the consolidated balance sheet prior to August
1, 2019 was not restated, and continues to be reported under previous guidance that did not require the recognition of operating lease
liabilities and corresponding lease assets on the consolidated balance sheet. The cumulative effect of the changes made to our Condensed
Consolidated Balance Sheet at August 1, 2019 for the adoption of the new lease standard was as follows:

The
adoption of ASU No. 2016-02 had an immaterial impact on the Company s consolidated statement of operation and consolidated statement
of cash flows for the year ended July 31, 2020. In addition, the Company elected the package of practical expedients permitted under
the transition guidance within the new standard, which allowed the Company to carry forward the historical lease classification, not
reassess prior conclusions related to expired or existing contracts that are or that contain leases, and not reassess the accounting
for initial direct costs. Operating leases with a term of 12 months or less will not be recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Additional
information and disclosures required by ASU No. 2016-02 are contained in Note 13 Leases. 

Recently
issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted 

In
June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments Credit Losses . The standard, including subsequently
issued amendments (ASU 2018-19, ASU 2019-04, ASU 2019-05, ASU 2019-10 and ASU 2019-11), requires a financial asset measured at amortized
cost basis, such as accounts receivable and certain other financial assets, to be presented at the net amount expected to be collected
based on relevant information about past events, including historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable
forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount. In November 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-10 to postpone the effective
date of ASU No. 2016-13 for public business entities eligible to be smaller reporting companies defined by the SEC to fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 2022, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is evaluating the impact of this guidance on
its consolidated financial statements. 

In
December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes which is intended to
simplify various aspects related to accounting for income taxes. The standard is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within

ITEM
8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

Report
of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 

To
the Board of Directors and shareholders of Hartford Great Health Corp. 

Opinions
on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Hartford Great Health Corp. and subsidiaries (the Company as of July 31, 2021 and 2020, and the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss, chan ges
in stockholders equity (deficit) and cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended July 31, 2021, and the related
notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements ). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of July 31, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations
and its cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended July 31, 2021, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States of America. 

Going
Concern Uncertainty 

The
accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed
in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has suffered recurring losses from operations and accumulated deficit
that raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management s plans in regard to these matters are
also described in Note 2. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

Basis
for Opinions 

These
consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion
on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required
to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations
of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud.
 The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control
over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting
but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our
audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether
due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence
regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

HARTFORD
GREAT HEALTH CORP. 

 Notes
to Financial Statements 

 For
the Years Ended July 31, 2021 and 2020 

NOTE
1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 

This
summary of significant accounting policies is presented to assist in understanding the Company s financial statements. The financial
statements and notes are the responsibility of the Company s management. These accounting policies conform to accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America US GAAP and have been consistently applied in the preparation of the
financial statements. 

Organization 

Hartford
Great Health Corp. was originally incorporated in the State of Nevada on April 2, 2008 under the name PhotoAmigo, Inc. It changed its
name to Hartford Great Health Corp. on August 22, 2018 and since then we have been engaged in activities to formulate and implement our
business plans. 

Through
its wholly owned subsidiary - Hangzhou Hartford Comprehensive Health Management, Ltd HZHF) and HZHF s 60 percent owned
subsidiary - Hangzhou Longjing Qiao Fu Vacation Hotel Co., Ltd. HZLJ ), and through Shanghai Hartford Comprehensive Health
Management, Ltd. HFSH and its 90 percent owned subsidiary - Shanghai Qiao Garden International Travel Agency Qiao
Garden Int l Travel ), the Company engages in hospitality industry in China. Qiao Garden Int l Travel was disposed
on December 31, 2020, see note 4 Acquisitions, Joint Ventures and Deconsolidation. 

The
Company started to engage in early childhood education industry at Hartford International Education Technology Co., Ltd HF Int l
Education ). On July 24, 2019 and March 23, 2020, HF Int l Education established two 100 owned subsidiaries, Pudong Haojin
Childhood Education Ltd. PDHJ and Shanghai Hongkou HaiDeFuDe Childcare Co., Ltd.( HDFD ), respectively, to
operate the early childhood education service under the brand name of HaiDeFuDe in Shanghai, China. On July 20, 2020, HF
Int l Education entered an agreement with two individuals to acquire the whole ownership of Shanghai Gelinke Childcare Education
Center Gelinke ). 

Basis
of Presentation 

The
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Hartford Great Health Corp, its wholly-owned subsidiaries and subsidiaries
in which it has a controlling interest. The Company reports noncontrolling interests of the consolidated entities as a component of equity
separate from the Company s equity. All material inter-company transactions between and among the Company and its consolidated
subsidiaries have been eliminated in the consolidation. The Company s net income (loss) excludes income (loss) attributable to
the noncontrolling interests. 

Use
of Estimates 

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires the Company s management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the amounts of assets and liabilities, the identification and disclosure of impaired assets and contingent liabilities at
the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from
those estimates. 

Foreign
Currency 

The
accounts of the Company s foreign subsidiaries are translated in accordance with FASB ASC 830. Foreign currency transaction gains
and losses are recognized in other expense, net, at the time they occur. Net foreign currency exchange gains or losses resulting from
the translation of assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries whose functional currency is not U.S. dollar are recorded as a part
of accumulated other comprehensive loss in stockholders equity. The Company does not undertake hedging transactions to cover its
foreign currency exposure. 

Comprehensive
Income (loss) 

For
the year ended July 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company included its foreign currency translation gain or loss as part of its comprehensive
income (loss). 

Fair
value measurement 

Fair
value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal
or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date.
Valuation techniques used to measure fair value must maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs.
Accounting Standard Codification ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures ASC 820 ), describes
a fair value hierarchy based on three levels of inputs, of which the first two are considered observable and the last unobservable, that
may be used to measure fair value, which are the following: 

Level
1 - Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities or funds. 

 Level
2 - Inputs other than Level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities;
quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for
substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. 

 Level
3 - Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or
liabilities. 

The
Company s financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents, related party receivables, prepaid and other current receivables,
related party payables and other current liabilities. The carrying amounts of afore-mentioned accounts approximate fair value because
of their short-term nature. 

23 

Cash
and Cash Equivalents 

The
Company maintains cash with banks in the United States and China. Should any bank holding cash become insolvent, or if the Company is
otherwise unable to withdraw funds, the Company would lose the cash with that bank; however, the Company has not experienced any losses
in such accounts and believes it is not exposed to any significant risks on its cash in bank accounts. In China, a depositor has up to
RMB500,000 insured by the People s Bank of China Financial Stability Bureau FSD ). In the United States, the standard
insurance amount is USD250,000 per depositor in a bank insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation FDIC ). Financial
instruments that potentially subject the Company to significant concentrations of credit risk are cash and cash equivalents and accounts
receivable. As of July 31, 2021 and 2020, nil of the Company s cash and cash equivalents held by financial institutions were uninsured.
With respect to accounts receivable, the Company generally does not require collateral and does not have an allowance for doubtful accounts. 

Receivables 

The
Company evaluates the collectability of its receivables based on a number of factors. In circumstances where the Company becomes aware
of a specific customer s or borrower s inability to meet its financial obligations to the Company, a specific reserve for
bad debts is estimated and recorded, which reduces the recognized receivable to the estimated amount the Company believes will ultimately
be collected. As of July 31, 2021 and 2020, all balances are collectable based on management s assessment. 

Property
and equipment, net 

Property
and equipment, net, are stated at cost. Depreciation and amortization are computed using the straight-line method over the estimated
useful lives of the assets. The estimated useful lives of property and equipment are as follows: 

Years 
 
 Leasehold
 improvements 
 Lesser
 of lease term or estimated useful life 
 
 ROU
 assets-Finance lease 
 Lease
 term 
 
 Furniture
 and fixtures 
 3-5 
 
 Office
 equipment and vehicles 
 3-5 
 
 Computer
 software 
 3-5 

Expenditures
for repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred. 

Goodwill
and Long-lived Assets 

Goodwill,
which represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired, is not amortized, in accordance
with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 350, Intangibles Goodwill and Other. ASC 350 requires that goodwill be tested for
impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis and between annual tests, if an event occurs or circumstances change that would
more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. These events or circumstances could include
a significant change in the business climate, legal factors, operating performance indicators, competition, or sale or disposition of
a significant portion of a reporting unit. 

The
Company has the option to assess goodwill for possible impairment by performing a qualitative analysis to determine whether the existence
of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than
its carrying amount. A quantitative assessment is performed if the qualitative assessment results in a more-likely-than-not determination
or if a qualitative assessment is not performed. The quantitative assessment considers whether the carrying amount of a reporting unit
exceeds its fair value, in which case an impairment charge is recorded to the extent that the reporting unit s carrying value exceeds
its fair value. The Company s goodwill was generated from the business acquisitions during the fiscal years ended July 31, 2021
and 2019. We currently have two reporting units - Hospitality and Early Childhood Education. Given the impact of COVID-19 pandemic and
the unfavorable operation results, goodwill impairment assessment was performed at interim time and annually. Based on the assessment
results, management determined that 1,006,343 goodwill and 621,963 deferred lease cost were fully impaired as of July 31, 2020. The
goodwill generated from Gelinke acquisition in 2021 was fully impaired as of July 31, 2021. 

Reclassifications 

Certain
amounts on the prior-year consolidated balance sheet, consolidated statement of operations and cash flows were reclassified to conform
to current-year presentation, with no effect on ending stockholders equity. 

24 

Business
Combinations 

If
an acquired set of activities and assets is capable of being operated as a business consisting of inputs and processes from the viewpoint
of a market participant, the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are a business. Business combinations are accounted for using the
acquisition method of accounting, which requires an acquirer to recognize the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at the acquisition
date measured at their fair values as of that date. Fair value determinations are based on discounted cash flow analyses or other valuation
techniques. In determining the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a material acquisition, the Company may utilize
appraisals from third party valuation firms to determine fair values of some or all of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, or
may complete some or all of the valuations internally. In either case, the Company takes full responsibility for the determination of
the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The value of goodwill reflects the excess of the fair value of the consideration
conveyed to the seller over the fair value of the net assets received. Acquisition-related costs that the Company incurs to affect a
business combination are expensed in the periods in which the costs are incurred. 

Noncontrolling
interest 

ASC
810 establishes accounting and reporting standards for ownership interests in subsidiaries held by parties other than the parent, the
amount of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and to the noncontrolling interest, changes in a parent s ownership
interest and the valuation of retained noncontrolling equity investments when a subsidiary is deconsolidated. ASC 810 also establishes
reporting requirements that provide sufficient disclosures that clearly identify and distinguish between the interest of the parent and
the interests of the noncontrolling owner. 

Advertising
costs 

Advertising
costs are expensed as incurred. During the year ended July 31, 2021 and 2020, amount of 65,406 and 12,582 advertising expenses were
incurred, respectively. 

Income
Taxes 

The
Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method in accordance with ASC 740, Accounting for Income Taxes. The asset
and liability method provides that deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary
differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for operating loss and tax credit carry forwards.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences
are expected to reverse. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more
likely than not to be realized. 

The
2017 Tax Reform Act permanently reduces the U.S. corporate income tax rate to a flat 21 rate. In addition, the 2017 Tax Reform Act also
creates a new requirement that certain income (i.e., Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income GILTI )) earned by controlled foreign
corporations CFCs must be included in the gross income of the CFCs U.S. shareholder income. The tax law in PRC
applies an income tax rate of 25 to all enterprises. The Company s subsidiary does not receive any preferential tax treatment
from local government. The Company has been in loss position for years and zero balances of tax provisions, deferred tax assets and liabilities
as of the reporting periods ended. 

Revenue
Recognition 

The
Company adopted ASC Topic 606 Revenue from Contracts with Customers Topic 606) on August 1, 2019, applying the modified retrospective
method to all contracts that were not completed as of August 1, 2019. The Company is building up its core business upon the completion
of multiple acquisitions in March 2019 and impact of COVID-19 pandemic, limited operations occurred during the years ended July
31, 2021and 2020. The revenue for the year ended July 31, 2021 and 2020 were mainly generated from HZLJ, PDHJ and Gelinke. 

25 

Revenue
is recognized when control of promised goods or services is transferred to our customers in an amount of consideration to which we expect
to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. We follow the five steps approach for revenue recognition under Topic 606:
(i) identify the contract(s) with a customer, (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract, (iii) determine the transaction
price, (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract, and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) we
satisfy a performance obligation. Billings to customers for which services are not rendered are considered deferred revenue. ASC 606
has no material impacts on the Company s financial positions. The Company s revenue is recognized when it satisfies a single
performance obligation by transferring control of its products or providing services to a customer. The Company s general payment
terms are short-term in duration. The Company does not have significant financing components or payment terms. The Company recorded 545,346
and 75,861 unsatisfied performance obligations and contract liabilities as of July 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. 

a. 
 Early
 childhood education services: HF Int l Education generates revenue from childhood education classes provided to its customers.
 The educational services consist of parent-child and bilingual childcare classes. Each contract of educational classes is accounted
 for as a single performance obligation which is satisfied proportionately over the service period. Tuition fee is generally collected
 in advance and is initially recorded as deferred revenue and transferred to contract liabilities after trial period. Refunds are
 provided to parents if they decide within the trial period that they no longer want to take the class. After the trial period, if
 a parent withdraws from a class, usually only that unearned portion of the fee is available to be returned. For the year ended July
 31, 2021 and 2020, 435,150 and 29,582, respectively, of revenue were derived from early childhood education classes provided. 

b. 
 Hospitality
 services: HZLJ generates revenue primarily from the room rentals, sale of food and beverage and other miscellaneous hospitality services.
 The Company recognizes room rental and services daily as services are provided. Under ASC 606, the pattern and timing of recognition
 of income from hotel facility is consistent with the prior accounting model. 

Income
(Loss) Per Share 

Basic
earnings per share include no dilution and are computed by dividing net income (or loss) by the weighted- average number of shares outstanding
during the period. Diluted earnings per share reflect the potential dilution of securities that could share in the earnings of the Company,
assuming the issuance of an equivalent number of common shares pursuant to options, warrants, or convertible debt arrangements. Diluted
earnings per share are not shown for periods in which the Company incurs a loss because it would be anti-dilutive. Similarly, potential
common stock equivalents are not included in the calculation if the effect would be anti-dilutive. No potentially dilutive debt or equity
securities were issued or outstanding during the year ended July 31, 2021 or 2020. 

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements. 

Recently
adopted accounting pronouncements 

In
January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04, Intangibles and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment ,
which eliminates the requirement to calculate the implied fair value of goodwill, but rather requires an entity to record an impairment
charge based on the excess of a reporting unit s carrying value over its fair value. This amendment is effective for annual or
interim goodwill impairment tests in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption is permitted. The Company early adopted
ASU No. 2017-04 on January 31, 2020. Management determined the goodwill generated from HZLJ and HFSH acquisition was fully impaired as
of January 31, 2020, and the goodwill generated from Gelinke acquisition was impaired as of July 31, 2021 

26 

The
Company adopted ASC 842 lease accounting policy on August 1, 2019 and elected not to restate comparative periods in transition and use
the effective date of ASU No. 2016-02 as the date of initial application of ASC 842. As a result, the consolidated balance sheet prior
to August 1, 2019 was not restated, and continues to be reported under previous lease guidance that did not require the recognition of
operating lease liabilities and corresponding lease assets on the consolidated balance sheet. The cumulative effect of the changes made
to our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet at August 1, 2019 for the adoption of the new lease standard was as follows:

The
adoption of ASU No. 2016-02 had an immaterial impact on the Company s consolidated statement of operation and consolidated statement
of cash flows for the year ended July 31, 2020. In addition, the Company elected the package of practical expedients permitted under
the transition guidance within the new standard, which allowed the Company to carry forward the historical lease classification, not
reassess prior conclusions related to expired or existing contracts that are or that contain leases, and not reassess the accounting
for initial direct costs. Operating leases with a term of 12 months or less will not be recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Additional
information and disclosures required by ASU No. 2016-02 are contained in Note 13 Leases. 

Recently
issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted 

In
June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments Credit Losses . The standard, including subsequently
issued amendments (ASU 2018-19, ASU 2019-04, ASU 2019-05, ASU 2019-10 and ASU 2019-11), requires a financial asset measured at amortized
cost basis, such as accounts receivable and certain other financial assets, to be presented at the net amount expected to be collected
based on relevant information about past events, including historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable
forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount. In November 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-10 to postpone the effective
date of ASU No. 2016-13 for public business entities eligible to be smaller reporting companies defined by the SEC to fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 2022, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is evaluating the impact of this guidance on
its consolidated financial statements. 

In
December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes which is intended to
simplify various aspects related to accounting for income taxes. The standard is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within
those years, beginning after December 15, 2020, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the effects of the
standard on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.

NOTE
2. GOING CONCERN 

The
accompanying financial statements were prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction
of obligations in the normal course of business. However, Hartford Great Health Corp. has incurred losses since inception, resulting
in an accumulated deficit of 5,821,519 as of July 31, 2021. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the ability of Hartford
Great Health Corp. to continue as a going concern. 

In
view of these matters, continuation as a going concern is dependent upon several factors, including the availability of debt or equity
funding upon terms and conditions acceptable to Hartford Great Health Corp., and ultimately achieving profitable operations. Management
believes that Hartford Great Health Corp. s business plan provides it with an opportunity to continue as a going concern. However,
management cannot provide assurance that Hartford Great Health Corp. will meet its objectives and be able to continue in operation. 

The
financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of
assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result from the possible inability of Hartford Great Health Corp. to
continue as a going concern.

NOTE
13. LEASES 

At
the inception of a contract, the Company assesses whether the contract is, or contains, a lease. Leases are classified as either finance
leases or operating leases based on criteria in Accounting Standards Codification ASC 842. Operating leases are included
in ROU assets-Operating lease, Current Operating Lease liabilities and Operating lease liabilities, finance leases are included in Property
and Equipment and Other Liabilities in the condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. 

Right-of-use ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of lease payments
over the lease term. As the lease did not provide an implicit rate, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate based on the information
available at the lease commencement date in China market. ROU assets also include any lease payments made and exclude lease incentives.
Lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise that option.
Lease expense for operating leases, consisting of lease payments, is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Lease expense
for finance leases consists of the amortization of the ROU asset on a straight-line basis over the asset s estimated useful life
and interest expense is calculated using the amortized cost basis. 

As
of July 31, 2021, the Company has multiple operating leases for office spaces and a finance lease of land and hotel building. Our operating
leases have remaining lease terms ranging from one year to five years, with various term extensions available. Our finance lease has
remaining lease term of thirty years. The Company has elected not to recognize ROU assets and lease liabilities for short-term operating
leases that have a term of twelve months or less. 

In

two lease agreements with Shanghai Longjin Corporate Management Co., Ltd (the Sublessor to lease office spaces (the Subleases ).

liability associated with the two Subleases as of May 31, 2020 were eliminated and 29,000 other expenses was recognized as a result.
HF Int l Education entered a new lease agreement with the Landlord on June 1, 2020 for the same office spaces with a five-year
term. On July 13, 2021, HF Int l Education entered a sublease agreement with sub-lessee (a third party) for some office space with

behalf of an unrelated individual. However, HF Int l Education does not have the obligation to absorb losses of SHHZJ or a right
to receive benefits from SHHZJ that could potentially be significant to SHHZJ, thus, SHHZJ is not considered a VIE of HF Int l

to SHHF at zero cost, see note 4 Acquisitions, joint ventures and deconsolidation .

appeal on these rental dispute cases will be granted. These final ruling proceedings are pending execution by the district court. Associated
with this Sublessor under the two lease agreements, the Company previously accrued 165,698 rental payable net with deposit. As a result

At
this time, the Company is unable to determine if it will be able to benefit from its deferred tax asset. There are limitations on the
utilization of net operating loss carry-forwards, including a requirement that losses be offset against future taxable income, if any.
In addition, there are limitations imposed by certain transactions which are deemed to be ownership changes. Accordingly, a full valuation
allowance has been established for the entire deferred tax asset. Other temporary differences and estimated permanent differences are
considered immaterial. Open tax years subject to examination by the IRS range from August 1, 2016 to the present. The Company has no
uncertain tax positions. 

The
Company has been in loss position for years since inception and zero balances of deferred tax assets and liabilities as of the reporting
periods ended. There was no GILTI tax for the Company for the years ended July 31, 2021 and 2020 due to the operation losses incurred.

Not

Item
9A. Controls and Procedures. 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

An
evaluation was performed under the supervision of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer (principal
financial officer), of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e)
and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report. Based on that evaluation, our management,
including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, concluded that, as of July 31, 2021, our disclosure controls and procedures
were not effective to ensure that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms due to material weaknesses
in our internal controls described below. 

Management s
Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. 

Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Exchange
Act Rule 13a-15(f). Our internal control system is intended to provide reasonable assurance to our management and board of directors
regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements and that we have controls and procedures designed to
ensure that the information required to be disclosed by us in our reports that we will be required to file under the Exchange Act is
accumulated and communicated to our management as appropriate to allow timely and informed decisions regarding financial disclosure. 

Our
management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of July 31, 2021. Based on this assessment,
management believes that as of July 31, 2021, our internal control over financial reporting was not effective based on those criteria. 

Management s
assessment identified several material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. These material weaknesses include
the following: 

Lack of proper authorization and approval procedures on significant business transactions. 

Lack of competence accounting personnel at entity level and proper segregation of duties implemented. 

Inherent
Limitations Over Internal Controls 

Our
management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures
or our internal controls will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide
only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Our control systems are designed to provide
such reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are
resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in
all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any,
within our Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include, but are not limited to, the realities that judgments in decision-making
can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual
acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the control. The design of any system of controls
also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will
succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes
in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a
cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. 

36 

Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. 

We
have made no change in our internal control over financial reporting during the last fiscal year that has materially affected, or is
reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

Attestation
Report of the Registered Public Accounting Firm. 

This
annual report does not include an attestation report of our independent registered public accounting firm regarding internal control
over financial reporting. Management s report was not subject to attestation by our independent registered public accounting firm
