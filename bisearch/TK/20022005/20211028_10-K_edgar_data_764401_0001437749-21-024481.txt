PART I 
 
 Item 1. Business 
 
 General 
 
 Insteel Industries, Inc. we, us, our, the Company or Insteel is the nation s largest manufacturer of steel wire reinforcing products for concrete construction applications. We manufacture and market prestressed concrete strand PC strand and welded wire reinforcement WWR ), including ESM, concrete pipe reinforcement CPR and standard welded wire reinforcement SWWR ). Our products are sold mainly to manufacturers of concrete products that are used primarily in nonresidential construction. For fiscal 2021, we estimate that approximately 85 of our sales were related to nonresidential construction and 15 were related to residential construction. 
 
 Insteel is the parent holding company for two wholly-owned subsidiaries, Insteel Wire Products Company IWP ), an operating subsidiary, and Intercontinental Metals Corporation, an inactive subsidiary. We were incorporated in 1958 in the State of North Carolina. 
 
 Our business strategy is focused on: (1) achieving leadership positions in our markets; (2) operating as the lowest cost producer in our industry; and (3) pursuing growth opportunities within our core businesses that further our penetration of the markets we currently serve or expand our footprint. Headquartered in Mount Airy, North Carolina, we operate ten manufacturing facilities that are all located in the U.S. in close proximity to our customers and raw material suppliers. Our growth strategy is focused on organic opportunities as well as strategic acquisitions in existing or related markets that leverage our infrastructure and core competencies in the manufacture and marketing of concrete reinforcing products. 
 
 On March 16, 2020, we, through our wholly-owned subsidiary, IWP, purchased substantially all of the assets of Strand-Tech Manufacturing, Inc. STM for an adjusted purchase price of 19.4 million, which reflects certain post-closing adjustments (the STM Acquisition ). STM was a leading manufacturer of PC strand for concrete construction applications. We acquired, among other assets, STM s accounts receivable, inventories, production equipment and facility located in Summerville, South Carolina and assumed certain of its accounts payable and accrued liabilities. Subsequent to the acquisition, we elected to consolidate our PC strand operations with the closure of the Summerville facility. 
 
 Products 
 
 Our operations are entirely focused on the manufacture and marketing of steel wire reinforcing products for concrete construction applications. Our concrete reinforcing products consist of two product lines: PC strand and WWR. Based on the criteria specified in Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB Accounting Standards Codification ASC Topic 280, Segment Reporting, we have one reportable segment. 
 
 PC strand is a high strength, seven-wire strand that is used to impart compression forces into precast concrete elements and structures, which may be either pretensioned or posttensioned, providing reinforcement for bridges, parking decks, buildings and other concrete structures. Its high tensile strength allows for the casting of longer spans and thinner sections. Pretensioned or prestressed concrete elements or structures are primarily used in nonresidential construction while posttensioned concrete elements or structures are used in both nonresidential and residential construction. 
 
 WWR is produced as either a standard or a specially engineered reinforcing product for use in nonresidential and residential construction. We produce a full range of WWR products, including ESM, CPR and SWWR. ESM is an engineered made-to-order product that is used as the primary reinforcement for concrete elements or structures, frequently serving as a lower cost reinforcing solution than hot-rolled rebar. CPR is an engineered made-to-order product that is used as the primary reinforcement in concrete pipe, box culverts and precast manholes for drainage and sewage systems, water treatment facilities and other related applications. SWWR is a secondary reinforcing product that is produced in standard styles for crack control applications in residential and light nonresidential construction, including driveways, sidewalks and various slab-on-grade applications. 
 
 See Note 15 for the disaggregation of our net sales by product line and geography. 
 
 Marketing and Distribution 
 
 We market our products through sales representatives who are our employees. Our outside sales representatives are trained on the technical applications for our products and sell multiple product lines in their respective territories. We sell our products nationwide across the U.S. and, to a much lesser extent, into Canada, Mexico, and Central and South America. Our products are shipped primarily by truck, using common or contract carriers. The delivery method selected is determined based on backhaul opportunities, comparative costs and customer service requirements. 

4

Customers 
 
 We sell our products to a broad range of customers that includes manufacturers of concrete products, and to a lesser extent, distributors, rebar fabricators and contractors. In fiscal 2021, we estimate that approximately 70 of our net sales were to manufacturers of concrete products and 30 were to distributors, rebar fabricators and contractors. In many cases we are unable to identify the specific end use for our products as most of our customers sell products that are used for both nonresidential and residential construction, and the same products can be used for different end uses. We did not have any customers that represented 10 or more of our net sales in fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019. The loss of a single customer or a few customers would not have a material adverse impact on our business. 
 
 Backlog 
 
 Backlog for our business is minimal due to the relatively short lead times that are required by our customers. We believe that the majority of our firm orders as of the end of fiscal 2021 will be shipped during the first quarter of fiscal 2022. 
 
 Seasonality and Cyclicality 
 
 Demand in our markets is both seasonal and cyclical, driven by the level of construction activity, but can also be impacted by fluctuations in the inventory positions of our customers. Shipments are seasonal, typically reaching their highest level when weather conditions are the most conducive to construction activity. As a result, assuming normal seasonal weather patterns, shipments and profitability are usually higher in the third and fourth quarters of the fiscal year and lower in the first and second quarters. Construction activity and demand for our products is cyclical based on overall economic conditions, although there can be significant differences between the relative strength of nonresidential and residential construction for extended periods. 
 
 Raw Materials 
 
 The primary raw material used to manufacture our products is hot-rolled carbon steel wire rod, which we purchase from both domestic and foreign suppliers and can generally be characterized as a commodity product. We purchase several different grades and sizes of wire rod with varying specifications based on the diameter, chemistry, mechanical properties and metallurgical characteristics that are required for our products. High carbon grades of wire rod are required for the production of PC strand while low carbon grades are used to manufacture WWR. 
 
 Wire rod prices tend to fluctuate based on changes in scrap and other metallic prices for steel producers together with domestic and global market conditions. In most economic environments, domestic demand for wire rod exceeds domestic production capacity and imports of wire rod are necessary to satisfy the supply requirements of the U.S. market. U.S. government trade policies and trade actions by domestic wire rod producers can significantly impact the pricing and availability of imported wire rod, which during fiscal years 2021 and 2020 represented approximately 16 and 7 , respectively, of our total wire rod purchases. We believe that our substantial wire rod requirements, desirable mix of sizes and grades, and strong financial condition represent a competitive advantage by making us a relatively more attractive customer to our suppliers. 
 
 Our ability to source wire rod from overseas suppliers is limited by domestic content requirements generally referred to as Buy America or Buy American laws that exist at both the federal and state levels. These laws generally prescribe a domestic melt and cast standard for purposes of compliance. Customers purchasing PC strand and WWR for certain applications require the Company to certify compliance with Buy America laws. 
 
 Selling prices for our products tend to be correlated with changes in wire rod prices. However, the timing and magnitude of the relative price changes varies depending upon market conditions and competitive factors. Ultimately the relative supply - demand balance in our markets and competitive dynamics determine whether our margins expand or contract during periods of rising or falling wire rod prices. 
 
 Competition 
 
 We are the nation s largest manufacturer of steel wire reinforcing products for concrete construction applications. Our markets are highly competitive based on price, quality and service. Some of our competitors, such as Nucor Corporation, Liberty Steel USA Liberty and Oklahoma Steel and Wire, are vertically integrated companies that produce both wire rod and concrete reinforcing products and offer multiple product lines over broad geographic areas. Other competitors are smaller independent companies that offer limited competition in certain markets. Our primary competitors for WWR products are Engineered Wire Products, Inc. (a subsidiary of Liberty), Wire Mesh Corporation, Concrete Reinforcements, Inc., National Wire Products, Davis Wire Corporation and Oklahoma Steel Wire Co., Inc. Our primary competitors for PC strand are Sumiden Wire Products Corporation and Wire Mesh Corporation. Import competition is also a significant factor in certain segments of the PC strand and SWWR markets that are not subject to Buy America requirements. 

5

In response to illegally traded import competition from offshore PC strand suppliers, we have pursued trade cases, when necessary, as a means of ensuring that foreign producers were complying with the applicable trade laws and regulations. In 2003, we joined together with a coalition of domestic PC strand producers and filed petitions with the U.S. Department of Commerce (the DOC alleging that imports of PC strand from Brazil, India, Korea, Mexico and Thailand were being dumped or sold in the U.S. at a price that was lower than fair value and had injured the domestic PC strand industry. The DOC ruled in our favor and imposed anti-dumping duties ranging from 12 up to 119 , which had the effect of limiting the participation of these countries in the domestic market. In 2010, we joined together with a coalition of domestic PC strand producers and filed petitions with the DOC alleging that imports of PC strand from China were being dumped or sold in the U.S. at a price that was lower than fair value and that subsidies were being provided to Chinese PC strand producers by the Chinese government, both of which had injured the domestic PC strand industry. The DOC ruled in our favor and imposed final countervailing duty margins ranging from 9 to 46 and anti-dumping margins ranging from 43 to 194 , which had the effect of limiting the continued participation of Chinese producers in the domestic market. In 2020, we joined two other domestic PC strand producers and filed anti-dumping petitions against Argentina, Columbia, Egypt, Indonesia, Italy, Malaysia, Netherlands, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Spain, Taiwan, Tunisia, Turkey, Ukraine and the United Arab Emirates. In January 2021, with respect to 8 countries, and in April 2021, with respect to 7 countries, the DOC ruled in our favor and imposed anti-dumping duties ranging from 4 to 194 , which had the effect of limiting the participation of these countries in the domestic market. Additionally, in 2020, we and four other domestic producers of SWWR filed anti-dumping petitions against Mexico. In July 2021, the DOC ruled in our favor and imposed final countervailing duty margins ranging from 23 to 110 , which had the effect of limiting the continued participation of Mexican producers in the domestic market. 
 
 Quality and service expectations of customers have risen substantially over the years and are key factors that impact their selection of suppliers. Technology has become a critical competitive factor from the standpoint of manufacturing costs, quality and customer service capabilities. In view of our strong market positions, broad product offering and national footprint, technologically advanced manufacturing facilities, low-cost production capabilities, sophisticated information systems and financial strength and flexibility, we believe that we are well-positioned to compete favorably with other producers of our concrete reinforcing products. 
 
 Human Capital 
 
 We value all our employees and their important role in the long-term success of the company. Our culture is rooted in three core principles: safety, pay for performance and equal opportunity. As of October 2, 2021, we had 913 employees, none of which were represented by labor unions. In the event of production disruptions, we believe that our contingency plans would enable us to continue serving our customers, although there can be no assurances that a work slowdown or stoppage would not adversely impact our operating costs and financial results. 
 
 Safe Operations 
 
 Our employees are extensively trained in a formal process of risk reduction and hazard elimination and empowered with the authority to stop equipment or tasks until work can be safely accomplished. Safe Operations with Zero Harm, our internal safety philosophy, is a key part of our ongoing employee training and operations. Zero Harm is managing risk, so no injuries, illness, or negative impact is experienced by employees, community, customers, property, the environment and shareholders. We monitor our safety performance through a key range of leading and lagging measures of safety. 

Leading Indicator Measures: 
 Lagging Indicator Measures: 

Hazard management process training Leadership engagement Employee involvement 
 Rolling 12-month Incident Recordable Rate Lost Time Rate Severity Rate Days Away, Restricted, and Transferred (DART)

Equitable Compensation 
 
 Our production and skilled trades team members earn pay increases through our Pay for Skills program and share in productivity pay through our Team Share incentive program. Our salaried team members also have a compensation structure that rewards individual performance in addition to company performance. We believe a compensation structure, which rewards both individual initiative and team accomplishments, leads to higher levels of performance. 
 
 Equal Opportunity 
 
 Our business depends on talented individuals who bring diverse skills, experiences, and backgrounds. We believe in a collaborative workplace that is based on the fundamentals of dignity, respect, equality and opportunity for all and encourage transparency and access to leadership through our Open-Door Policy, Code of Business Conduct (including Whistleblower Hotline), Equal Opportunity Policy, Harassment Policy, and Mission and Values. 
 
 Our performance and succession development process includes all employees. We have many team members in key leadership roles who started in entry-level roles and have grown in their careers by partnering with us in their development plans. In addition, we are involved in many outreach programs in our communities to provide opportunities to diverse talent sources that may otherwise be overlooked or face barriers to equal opportunity. 
 
 Product Warranties 
 
 Our products are used in applications that are subject to inherent risks, including performance deficiencies, personal injury, property damage, environmental contamination or loss of production. We warrant our products to meet certain specifications. Although actual or claimed deficiencies from these specifications may give rise to claims, we do not maintain a reserve for warranties as the historical claims have been immaterial. We maintain product liability insurance coverage to minimize our exposure to such risks. 
 
 Environmental Matters 
 
 We believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and regulations. We have experienced no material difficulties in complying with legislative or regulatory standards and believe that these standards have not materially impacted our financial position or results of operations. Although our future compliance with additional environmental requirements could necessitate capital outlays, we do not believe these expenditures would ultimately have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations. We do not expect to incur material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities during fiscal 2022.

 Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 
 An investment in our common stock involves risks and uncertainties. You should carefully consider the following risk factors, in addition to the other information contained in this annual report on Form 10-K, before deciding whether an investment in our common stock is suitable for you. The risk factors described below are not the only ones we face. There may be other risks and uncertainties that are currently unknown to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial that could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. 
 
 Industry Specific Risks 
 
 Our business is cyclical and can be negatively impacted by prolonged economic downturns or tightening in the financial markets that reduce the level of construction activity and demand for our products. 
 
 Demand for our products is cyclical in nature and sensitive to changes in the economy and in the financial markets. Our products are sold primarily to manufacturers of concrete products that are used for a broad range of nonresidential and residential construction applications. Demand for our products is driven by the level of construction activity, which tends to be correlated with conditions in the overall economy as well as other factors beyond our control. Tightening in the financial markets could adversely impact demand for our products by reducing the availability of financing to our customers and the construction industry as a whole and increasing the risk of payment defaults on our accounts receivable. Future prolonged periods of economic weakness or reduced availability of financing could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. 

7

Our business can be negatively impacted by reductions in the amount and duration of government funding for infrastructure projects that reduce the level of construction activity and demand for our products. 
 
 Certain of our products are used in the construction of highways, bridges and other infrastructure projects that are funded by federal, state and local governments. Reductions in the amount of funding for such projects or the period for which it is provided could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. 
 
 Foreign competition could adversely impact our financial results. 
 
 Certain of our PC strand and SWWR markets are subject to foreign import competition on an ongoing basis. If we are unable to purchase raw materials and achieve manufacturing costs that are competitive with those of foreign producers, or if the margin and return requirements of foreign producers are substantially lower, our market share and profit margins could be negatively impacted. In response to illegally traded import competition from offshore PC strand and SWWR suppliers, we have pursued trade cases, when necessary, as a means of ensuring that foreign producers were complying with the applicable trade laws and regulations. Such actions may be costly and may not be successful. Trade law enforcement is critical to our ability to maintain our competitive position against foreign PC strand and SWWR producers that engage in unlawful trade practices. 
 
 Our financial results can be negatively impacted by the volatility in the cost and availability of our primary raw material, hot-rolled carbon steel wire rod. 
 
 The primary raw material used to manufacture our products is hot-rolled carbon steel wire rod, which we purchase from both domestic and foreign suppliers. We do not use derivative commodity instruments to hedge our exposure to changes in the price of wire rod as such instruments are currently unavailable in the financial markets. Prices for wire rod have become increasingly volatile in recent years driven by the higher degree of variability in raw material costs for rod producers, changes in trade policy and the tightening of domestic supply. In response, wire rod producers have resorted to increasing the frequency of price adjustments, typically on a monthly basis as well as unilaterally changing the terms of prior commitments. 
 
 Although changes in our wire rod costs and selling prices tend to be correlated, we may be unable to fully recover increased rod costs during weaker market environments, which would reduce our earnings and cash flows. Additionally, when raw material costs decline, our financial results would be negatively impacted if the selling prices for our products decrease to an even greater extent and if we are consuming higher cost material from inventory. 
 
 Our financial results can also be significantly impacted if raw material supplies are inadequate to satisfy our purchasing requirements. For example, U.S. government trade policies and trade actions by domestic wire rod producers against other countries can significantly impact the availability and cost of imported wire rod. The imposition of tariffs, quotas or anti-dumping or countervailing duty margins by the U.S. government against exporting countries can have the effect of reducing or eliminating their competitiveness and participation in the domestic market. If we were unable to obtain adequate and timely delivery of our raw material requirements, we may be unable to manufacture sufficient quantities of our products or operate our manufacturing facilities in an efficient manner, which could result in lost sales and higher operating costs. Because tight market conditions typically affect the entire industry, during past periods of short raw material supply, margins and profitability have been favorably impacted due to curtailed availability of PC strand and WWR that supported higher average selling prices. There is no assurance that future short supply conditions in raw material markets would result in similar outcomes, however. 
 
 Demand for our products is highly variable and difficult to forecast due to our minimal backlog and unanticipated changes that can occur in customer order patterns or inventory levels. 
 
 Demand for our products is highly variable. The short lead times for customer orders and minimal backlog that characterize our business make it difficult to forecast the future level of demand for our products. In some cases, unanticipated softening in demand can be exacerbated by inventory rebalancing measures pursued by our customers, which may cause significant fluctuations in our sales, profitability and cash flows. 

8

Operational Risks 
 
 Our manufacturing facilities are subject to unexpected equipment failures, operational interruptions and casualty losses. 
 
 Our manufacturing facilities are subject to risks that may limit our ability to manufacture and sell our products, including unexpected equipment failures, operational interruptions and catastrophic losses due to other unanticipated events such as fires, explosions, accidents, adverse weather conditions and transportation interruptions. Any such equipment failures or events can subject us to plant shutdowns and periods of reduced production or unexpected downtime. Furthermore, the resolution of certain operational interruptions may require significant capital expenditures. Although our insurance coverage could offset the losses or expenditures relating to some of these events, our results of operations and cash flows would be negatively impacted to the extent that such claims were not covered or only partially covered by our insurance. 
 
 Our financial results could be adversely impacted by the escalation of our operating costs. 
 
 Consistent with the experience of other employers, our labor, medical and workers compensation costs have increased substantially in recent years and are expected to continue to rise. If this trend continues, the cost of labor and to provide healthcare and other benefits to our employees could increase, adversely impacting profitability. As the labor market recovers from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, competition for employees has escalated which has increased costs associated with attracting and retaining employees. We cannot be certain that we will be able to maintain an adequately skilled labor force necessary to operate efficiently or that our labor costs will not increase as a result of a shortage in the availability of skilled employees. Changes to healthcare regulations involving the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act may also increase the cost of providing such benefits to our employees. We cannot predict the ultimate content, timing, or effect of any healthcare reform legislation or the impact of potential legislation or related proposals and policies on our results. Any significant increases in the costs attributable to our self-insured health and workers compensation plans could adversely impact our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. 
 
 In addition, increasing prices for freight, natural gas, electricity, fuel and consumables would adversely affect our manufacturing and distribution costs. For most of our business, we incur the transportation costs associated with the delivery of products to our customers. Although we have previously implemented numerous measures to offset the impact of increases in these costs, there can be no assurance that such actions will be effective. If we are unable to pass these additional costs through by raising our selling prices, our financial results could be adversely impacted. 

Our business and operations are subject to risks related to climate change. 
 
 The long-term effects of global climate change could present both physical risks and transition risks (such as regulatory or technology changes), which are expected to be widespread and unpredictable. These changes could over time affect, for example, the availability and cost of raw materials, commodities and energy (including utilities), which in turn may impact our ability to procure goods or services required for the operation of our business at the quantities and levels we require. Additionally, we have facilities located in areas that may be impacted by the physical risks of climate change, and we face the risk of losses incurred as a result of physical damage to our facilities and inventory as well business interruption caused by such events. Furthermore, periods of extended inclement weather or associated flooding may inhibit construction activity utilizing our products and delay shipments of our products to customers. We also use natural gas, diesel fuel, gasoline and electricity in our operations, all of which could face increased regulation as a result of climate change or other environmental concerns. Additionally, we may face increased costs to respond to future water laws and regulations, and operations in areas with limited water availability may be impacted if droughts become more frequent or severe. Any such events could have a material adverse effect on our costs or results of operations. 
 
 Financing Risks 
 
 Our operations are subject to seasonal fluctuations that may impact our cash flows. 
 
 Our shipments are typically lower in the first and second fiscal quarters due to the unfavorable impact of winter weather on construction activity during these periods and customer plant shutdowns associated with holidays. As a result, our cash flows may fluctuate from quarter to quarter due to these seasonal factors. 

9

Our capital resources may not be adequate to provide for our capital investment and maintenance expenditures if we were to experience a substantial downturn in our financial performance. 
 
 Our operations are capital intensive and require substantial recurring expenditures for the routine maintenance of our equipment and facilities. Although we expect to finance our business requirements through internally generated funds or from borrowings under our 100.0 million revolving credit facility, we cannot provide any assurances these resources will be sufficient to support our business. A material adverse change in our operations or financial condition could limit our ability to borrow funds under our credit facility, which could further adversely impact our liquidity and financial condition. Any significant future acquisitions could require additional financing from external sources that may not be available on favorable terms, which could adversely impact our growth, operations, financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 Legal and Regulatory Risks 
 
 Changes in environmental compliance and remediation requirements could result in substantial increases in our capital investments and operating costs. 
 
 Our business is subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations pertaining to the protection of the environment that could require substantial increases in capital investments and operating costs. These laws and regulations, which are constantly evolving, are becoming increasingly stringent, and the ultimate impact of compliance is not always clearly known or determinable because regulations under some of these laws have not yet been promulgated or are undergoing revision. 
 
 General Risks 
 
 Our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and stock price can be adversely affected by pandemics, epidemics or other public health emergencies, such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. 
 
 Our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and stock price can be adversely affected by pandemics, epidemics or other public health emergencies, such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Governments around the world have implemented stringent measures to help control the spread of the virus, including quarantines, shelter in place and stay at home orders, travel restrictions, business curtailments, school closures, vaccination mandates and other measures. These measures, along with further voluntary measures by businesses and individuals, may impact our working conditions, productivity and operations, as well as those of our customers and suppliers. In addition, governments and central banks in several parts of the world have enacted fiscal and monetary stimulus measures to counteract the impacts of COVID-19. 
 
 We are considered a critical infrastructure industry, as defined by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. Although we have continued to operate our facilities to date consistent with federal guidelines and state and local orders, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and any preventive or protective actions taken by governmental authorities may have a material adverse effect on our operations, supply chain, customers and transportation networks, including business shutdowns or disruptions. The extent to which COVID-19 may adversely impact our business depends on future developments, which are highly uncertain and unpredictable, depending upon the severity and duration of the outbreak, the emergence of additional virus variants, vaccination rates and the effectiveness of actions taken globally to contain or mitigate its effects. Even after the COVID-19 pandemic has subsided, we may experience material adverse impacts to our business due to any resulting economic recession. We continue to closely monitor the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on all aspects of our business and the potential effect on our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. The situation remains dynamic and the ultimate duration and impact on our business are not known at this time. 
 
 Our stock price can be volatile, often in connection with matters beyond our control. 
 
 Equity markets in the U.S. have been increasingly volatile in recent years. During fiscal 2021, our common stock traded as high as 44.00 and as low as 18.83. There are numerous factors that could cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate significantly, including: variations in our financial results; changes in our business outlook and expectations for the construction industry; changes in market valuations of companies in our industry; and announcements by us, our competitors or industry participants that may be perceived to impact our financial results. 

10

We are increasingly dependent on information technology systems that are susceptible to certain risks, including cybersecurity breaches and data leaks, which could adversely impact our business. 
 
 Our increasing reliance on technology systems and infrastructure heightens our potential vulnerability to system failure and malfunction, breakdowns due to natural disasters, human error, unauthorized access, power loss and other unforeseen events. Data privacy breaches by employees and others with or without authorized access to our systems poses risks that sensitive data may be permanently lost or leaked to the public or other unauthorized persons. With the growing use and rapid evolution of technology, not limited to cloud-based computing and mobile devices, there are additional risks of unintentional data leaks. There is also the risk of the theft of confidential information, intentional vandalism, industrial espionage and a variety of cyber-attacks that could compromise our internal technology system and infrastructure or result in data leaks in-house or at our third-party providers and business partners. Failures of technology or related systems, or an improper release of confidential information, could adversely impact our business or subject us to unexpected liabilities. 
 
 Our financial results could be adversely impacted by the impairment of goodwill. 
 
 Our balance sheet includes intangible assets, including goodwill and other separately identifiable assets related to prior acquisitions, and we may acquire additional intangible assets in connection with future acquisitions. We are required to review goodwill for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if certain indicators of permanent impairment arise such as, among other things, a decline in our stock price and market capitalization or a reduction in our projected operating results and cash flows. If our review indicates that goodwill has been impaired, the impaired portion would have to be written-off during that period which could adversely impact our business and financial results. 
 
 Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments. 
 
 None. 
 
 Item 2. Properties. 
 
 Our corporate headquarters and IWP s sales and administrative offices are located in Mount Airy, North Carolina. As of October 2, 2021, we operated ten manufacturing facilities located in Dayton, Texas; Gallatin, Tennessee; Hazleton, Pennsylvania; Hickman, Kentucky; Houston, Texas; Jacksonville, Florida; Kingman, Arizona; Mount Airy, North Carolina; Sanderson, Florida; and St. Joseph, Missouri. Additionally, we are currently pursuing the sale of an idle facility located in Summerville, South Carolina. 
 
 We own all of our real estate. We believe that our properties are in good operating condition and that our machinery and equipment have been well maintained. We also believe that our manufacturing facilities are suitable for their intended purposes and have capacities adequate to satisfy the current and projected demand for our products. 
 
 Item 3. Legal Proceedings. 
 
 We are involved in lawsuits, claims, investigations and proceedings, including commercial, environmental and employment matters, which arise in the ordinary course of business. We do not anticipate that the ultimate cost to resolve these matters will have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

 Item 6. Reserved. 
 
 Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 
 
 The matters discussed in this section include forward-looking statements that are subject to numerous risks. You should carefully read the Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors in this Form 10-K. 
 
 Overview 
 
 Our operations are entirely focused on the manufacture and marketing of concrete reinforcing products for the concrete construction industry. Our business strategy is focused on: (1) achieving leadership positions in our markets; (2) operating as the lowest cost producer in our industry; and (3) pursuing growth opportunities within our core businesses that further our penetration of the markets we currently serve or expand our footprint. 

13

On March 16, 2020, we, through our wholly-owned subsidiary, IWP, purchased substantially all of the assets of STM for an adjusted purchase price of 19.4 million, which reflects certain post-closing adjustments. STM was a leading manufacturer of PC strand for concrete construction applications. We acquired, among other assets, STM s accounts receivable, inventories, production equipment and facility located in Summerville, South Carolina and assumed certain of its accounts payable and accrued liabilities. Subsequent to the acquisition, we elected to consolidate our PC strand operations with the closure of the Summerville facility. 
 
 Impact of COVID-19 
 
 Despite the significant disruption in the U.S. and global economies, including supply chain challenges and labor market obstacles, COVID-19 has had a limited impact on our operations to date. We have implemented procedures to support the health and safety of our employees and we are following all U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines. While the U.S. economy appears to be entering a recovery and operating conditions are improving, we continue to closely monitor the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on all aspects of our business and the potential effect on our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. There are many uncertainties regarding the future and ultimate impact that COVID-19 will have on all aspects of our business. We will continue to assess and make adjustments as necessary. 
 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 
 Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on these consolidated financial statements. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires the application of these accounting principles in addition to certain estimates and judgments based on current available information, actuarial estimates, historical results and other assumptions believed to be reasonable. These estimates, assumptions and judgments are affected by our application of accounting policies, which are discussed in Note 2, "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies", and elsewhere in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Estimates are used for, but not limited to, determining the net carrying value of trade accounts receivable, inventories, recording self-insurance liabilities and other accrued liabilities. Estimates are also used in establishing opening balances in relation to purchase accounting. Actual results could differ from these estimates. 
 
 Accounting estimates are considered critical if both of the following conditions are met: (1) the nature of the estimates or assumptions is material because of the levels of subjectivity and judgment needed to account for matters that are highly uncertain and susceptible to change and (2) the effect of the estimates and assumptions is material to the financial statements. 
 
 We have reviewed our accounting estimates, and none were deemed to be considered critical for the accounting periods presented. 
 
 Recent Accounting Pronouncements . 
 
 The nature and impact of recent accounting pronouncements is discussed in Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements and incorporated herein by reference. 
 
 Results of Operations 
 
 The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is for the year ended October 2, 2021 compared with the year ended October 3, 2020. Discussions of our financial condition and results of operations for the year ended October 3, 2020 compared to September 28, 2019 that have been omitted under this item can be found in Part II, Item 7 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 3, 2020 , which was filed with the SEC on October 29, 2020.

2021 Compared with 2020 
 
 Net Sales 
 
 Net sales increased 25.0 to 590.6 million in 2021 from 472.6 million in 2020, reflecting a 25.7 increase in selling prices partially offset by a 0.6 decrease in shipments. The increase in average selling prices was driven by price increases implemented in the current year primarily to recover the escalation in raw material costs together with strong demand for our products. Shipments for the prior year benefited from an extra week based on our fiscal calendar. On a pro forma basis adjusting the prior year to reflect the same 52-week period as 2021, the year-over-year shipment increase was 1.6 . The pro forma increase in shipments was primarily due to improved market conditions, the additional business provided by the STM Acquisition and strengthening demand for our products relative to the prior year, which offset the impact on shipments resulting from sustained tight supply conditions for raw materials. Shipments for both years were not materially impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. 
 
 Gross Profit 
 
 Gross profit increased 117.9 to 121.5 million, or 20.6 of net sales, in 2021 from 55.8 million, or 11.8 of net sales, in 2020. The year-over-year increase was primarily due to higher spreads between average selling prices and raw material costs 73.2 million) partially offset by higher manufacturing costs 7.0 million) and a decrease in shipments 436,000). The increase in spreads was driven by higher average selling prices 122.2 million) partially offset by higher raw material costs 46.7 million) and freight expense 2.3 million). 
 
 Selling, General and Administrative Expense 
 
 Selling, general and administrative expense SG A expense increased 3.3 to 32.4 million, or 5.5 of net sales, in 2021 from 31.3 million, or 6.6 of net sales, in 2020 primarily due to higher compensation 3.5 million) and legal expense 392,000) offset by the relative year-over-year changes in the cash surrender value of life insurance policies 1.3 million) and lower earnout expense 1.4 million). The increase in compensation expense was largely driven by higher incentive plan expense due to our improved financial results in the current year. The increase in legal expense was primarily related to costs associated with trade matters. The decrease in earnout expense was due to the revaluation of a contingent earnout liability in the prior year. 

15

Restructuring Charges, Net 
 
 Net restructuring charges of 2.9 million were incurred in 2021 compared with 1.7 million in the prior year. The net restructuring charges were related to the closure of the Summerville, South Carolina facility, which had been acquired through the STM Acquisition, and consolidation of our PC strand operations. Net restructuring charges in 2021 included asset impairment charges 1.4 million), facility closure costs 1.0 million), equipment relocation costs 423,000) and employee separation costs 13,000). The net restructuring charges incurred in the prior year were for facility closure costs 806,000), equipment relocation costs 482,000), impairment charges related to the decommissioning of equipment 343,000) and employee separation costs 182,000). These charges were partially offset by a 118,000 gain from the sale of equipment associated with the Summerville facility. 
 
 Acquisition Costs 
 
 Acquisition costs of 195,000 were incurred in 2020 for legal, accounting and other professional fees related to the STM Acquisition. There were no acquisition costs incurred in 2021. 
 
 Other Expense (Income), Net 
 
 Other expense was 114,000 for 2021 compared with other income of 1.3 million in 2020. Other income in the prior year was primarily related to a gain from the disposition of assets held for sale. 
 
 Income Taxes 
 
 Our effective income tax rate for 2021 increased to 22.6 from 21.4 in 2020 due to a discrete tax benefit recorded in the prior year in connection with the net operating loss carryback provisions of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act, which was enacted in March 2020. 
 
 Net Earnings 
 
 Net earnings increased to 66.6 million 3.41 per diluted share) in 2021 from 19.0 million 0.98 per diluted share) in 2020 primarily due to the increase in gross profit partially offset by higher SG A expense and restructuring charges associated with the consolidation of our PC strand operations. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 Overview 
 
 Our sources of liquidity include cash and cash equivalents, cash generated by operating activities and borrowing availability provided under our 100.0 million revolving credit facility (the Credit Facility ). Our principal capital requirements include funding working capital, capital expenditures, dividends and any share repurchases. As of October 2, 2021, our cash and cash equivalents totaled 89.9 million compared with 68.7 million as of October 3, 2020.

Operating Activities 
 
 Operating activities provided 69.9 million of cash in 2021 primarily from net earnings adjusted for non-cash items partially offset by an increase in working capital. Working capital used 12.3 million of cash due to a 14.1 million increase in accounts receivable and a 10.1 million increase in inventories partially offset by an 11.9 million increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses. The increase in accounts receivable and inventories were due to the escalation in raw material costs and average selling prices during 2021. The increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses was primarily related to raw material purchases with higher unit costs near the end of the period and, to a lesser extent, increases in accrued salaries, wages and related expenses and income taxes. 
 
 Operating activities provided 56.2 million of cash in 2020 primarily from net earnings adjusted for non-cash items together with decrease in working capital. Working capital provided 19.4 million of cash due to a 20.2 million increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses and a 5.1 million decrease in inventories partially offset by a 5.8 million increase in accounts receivable. The increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses was primarily related to higher raw material purchases near the end of the year together with increases in accrued salaries, wages and related expenses, earnout liability and income taxes. The decrease in inventories was primarily driven by lower unit costs partially offset by higher raw material purchases. The increase in accounts receivable was primarily related to higher shipments partially offset by lower average selling prices. 
 
 We may elect to adjust our operating activities as there are changes in the conditions in our construction end-markets, which could materially impact our cash requirements. While a downturn in the level of construction activity affects sales to our customers, it generally reduces our working capital requirements. 
 
 Investing Activities 
 
 Investing activities used 17.8 million of cash in 2021 primarily due to capital expenditures 17.5 million) and an increase in the cash surrender value of life insurance policies 0.4 million). Investing activities used 23.2 million of cash in 2020 primarily due to the STM Acquisition 18.4 million) and capital expenditures 7.1 million) partially offset by the receipt of proceeds from the sale of assets held for sale 2.2 million). Capital expenditures for both years focused on cost and productivity improvement initiatives in addition to recurring maintenance requirements. Capital expenditures are expected to total up to 25.0 million in 2022, which include expenditures primarily to advance the growth of our engineered structural mesh business and to support cost and productivity improvement initiatives as well as recurring maintenance requirements. Our investing activities are largely discretionary, providing us with the ability to significantly curtail outlays should future business conditions warrant that such actions be taken. 
 
 Financing Activities 
 
 Financing activities used 30.9 million of cash in 2021 and 2.5 million of cash in 2020. In 2021, 31.3 million of cash was used for dividend payments (including a special cash dividend of 29.0 million, or 1.50 per share, and regular cash dividends totaling 2.3 million), which was partially offset by 1.1 million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options. In 2020, 2.3 million of cash was used for dividend payments. 
 
 Cash Management 
 
 Our cash is principally concentrated at one financial institution, which at times exceeds federally insured limits. We invest excess cash primarily in money market funds, which are highly liquid securities that bear minimal risk. 
 
 Credit Facility 
 
 We have a Credit Facility that is used to supplement our operating cash flow and fund our working capital, capital expenditure, general corporate and growth requirements. In May 2019, we entered into a new credit agreement, which amended and restated in its entirety the previous agreement pertaining to the revolving credit facility that had been in effect since June 2010. The new credit agreement, among other changes, extended the maturity date of the Credit Facility from May 13, 2020 to May 15, 2024 and provided for an accordion feature whereby its size may be increased by up to 50.0 million, subject to our lender s approval. Advances under the Credit Facility are limited to the lesser of the revolving loan commitment amount (currently 100.0 million) or a borrowing base amount that is calculated based upon a percentage of eligible receivables and inventories. As of October 2, 2021, no borrowings were outstanding on the Credit Facility, 98.6 million of borrowing capacity was available and outstanding letters of credit totaled 1.4 million (see Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements). As of October 3, 2020, there were no borrowings outstanding on the Credit Facility. 

17

We believe that, in the absence of significant unanticipated cash demands, cash and cash equivalents, cash generated by operating activities and the borrowing availability provided under the Credit Facility will be sufficient to satisfy our expected requirements for working capital, capital expenditures, dividends and share repurchases, if any. We also expect to have access to the amounts available under our Credit Facility as required. However, should we experience future reductions in our operating cash flows due to weakening conditions in our construction end-markets and reduced demand from our customers, we may need to curtail capital and operating expenditures, delay or restrict share repurchases, cease dividend payments and/or realign our working capital requirements. 
 
 Should we determine, at any time, that we require additional short-term liquidity, we would evaluate the alternative sources of financing that were potentially available to provide such funding. There can be no assurance that any such financing, if pursued, would be obtained, or if obtained, would be adequate or on terms acceptable to us. However, we believe that our strong balance sheet, flexible capital structure and borrowing capacity available to us under our Credit Facility position us to meet our anticipated liquidity requirements for the foreseeable future. 
 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 
 We do not have any material transactions, arrangements, obligations (including contingent obligations), or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons, as defined by Item 303(a)(4) of Regulation S-K of the SEC, that have or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future impact on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, capital resources or significant components of revenues or expenses. 
 
 Contractual Obligations 
 
 In addition to our discussion and analysis surrounding our liquidity and capital resources, our contractual obligations and commitments as of October 2, 2021, include: 

Raw Material Purchase Commitments See Note 12, Commitments and Contingencies, within our consolidated financial statements for further details concerning our non-cancelable raw material purchase commitments. 

Supplemental Employee Retirement Plan Obligations See Note 11, Employee Benefit Plans, within our consolidated financial statements for further detail of our obligations and the timing of expected future payments under our supplemental employee retirement plan. 

Operating Leases See Note 13, Leases, within our consolidated financial statements for further detail of our obligations and the timing of expected future payments, including a five-year maturity schedule. 

Debt Obligations and Interest Payments - See Note 8, Long-Term Debt, within our consolidated financial statements for further detail of our debt and the timing of expected future principal and interest payments. As of October 2, 2021, there were no borrowings outstanding. 

Capital Expenditures As of October 2, 2021, we had contractual commitments for capital expenditures of 3.6 million. 

Impact of Inflation 
 
 We are subject to inflationary risks arising from fluctuations in the market prices for our primary raw material, hot-rolled carbon steel wire rod, and, to a much lesser extent, labor, freight, energy and other consumables that are used in our manufacturing processes. We have generally been able to adjust our selling prices to pass through increases in these costs or offset them through various cost reduction and productivity improvement initiatives. However, our ability to raise our selling prices depends on market conditions and competitive dynamics, and there may be periods during which we are unable to fully recover increases in our costs. 
 
 During 2021, we were successful in implementing price increases sufficient to recover the escalation in our raw material costs that occurred over the course of the year. In 2020, selling prices for our products declined in response to low-priced import competition, which negatively impacted our financial results. The timing and magnitude of any future increases in raw material costs and the impact on selling prices for our products is uncertain at this time. 
 
 Outlook 
 
 Looking ahead to fiscal 2022, we expect continued robust demand in our construction markets. The economic recovery along with sustained favorable forecasts from widely monitored leading market indicators in private non-residential construction and a resilient public construction market are supporting our optimism in the demand outlook. We also believe there is a possibility that Congress and the Administration will successfully negotiate an infrastructure investment plan that may benefit our markets, although the ultimate size and timing of any improvements are not possible to project. 

18

The supply shortage and escalating prices for steel wire rod, our primary raw material, remains a key concern. In addition, critically tight labor markets are expected to continue to negatively affect our operations. These challenges may impact our ability to meet fully our customer demand and result in plant operating inefficiencies and customer service delays. We expect to continue passing the rising costs through the supply chain, but we would anticipate margins returning to more normalized levels once the raw materials markets stabilize. Additionally, our markets and operations remain vulnerable to the lingering impact of COVID-19. 
 
 Regardless of the market dynamics, we continue to focus on those factors we control: closely managing and controlling our expenses; aligning our production schedules with demand in a proactive manner as there are changes in market conditions to minimize our operating costs; and pursuing further improvements in the productivity and effectiveness of all our manufacturing, selling and administrative activities. We also expect gradually increasing contributions from the substantial investments we have made in our facilities in the form of reduced operating costs and additional capacity to support future growth. Finally, we will continue to pursue acquisitions opportunistically in our existing businesses that expand our penetration of markets we currently serve or expand our footprint. 
 
 The statements contained in this section are forward-looking statements. See Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors . 
 
 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 
 Our cash flows and earnings are subject to fluctuations resulting from changes in commodity prices, interest rates and foreign exchange rates. We manage our exposure to these market risks through internally established policies and procedures and, when appropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments. We do not use financial instruments for trading purposes and are not a party to any leveraged derivatives. We monitor our underlying market risk exposures on an ongoing basis and believe we can modify or adapt our hedging strategies as necessary. 
 
 Commodity Prices 
 
 We are subject to significant fluctuations in the cost and availability of our primary raw material, hot-rolled carbon steel wire rod, which we purchase from both domestic and foreign suppliers. We negotiate quantities and pricing for both domestic and foreign wire rod purchases for varying periods (most recently monthly for domestic suppliers), depending upon market conditions, to manage our exposure to price fluctuations and to ensure adequate availability of material consistent with our requirements. We do not use derivative commodity instruments to hedge our exposure to changes in prices as such instruments are not currently available for wire rod. Our ability to acquire wire rod from foreign sources on favorable terms is impacted by fluctuations in strength of home markets, foreign currency exchange rates, foreign taxes, duties, tariffs, quotas and other trade actions. Although changes in our wire rod costs and selling prices tend to be correlated, in weaker market environments, we may be unable to fully recover increased wire rod costs, which would reduce our earnings and cash flows. Additionally, when raw material costs decline, our financial results may be negatively impacted if the selling prices for our products decrease to an even greater extent and if we are consuming higher cost material from inventory. Based on our 2021 shipments and average wire rod cost reflected in cost of sales, a 10 increase in the price of wire rod would have resulted in a 32.7 million decrease in our annual pre-tax earnings (assuming there was not a corresponding change in our selling prices). 
 
 Interest Rates 
 
 Although we did not have any balances outstanding on our Credit Facility as of October 2, 2021, future borrowings under the facility are subject to a variable rate of interest and are sensitive to changes in interest rates. 
 
 Foreign Exchange Exposure 
 
 We have not typically hedged foreign currency exposures related to transactions denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars, as such transactions have not been material historically. We will occasionally hedge firm commitments for certain equipment purchases that are denominated in foreign currencies. The decision to hedge any such transactions is made by us on a case-by-case basis. There were no forward contracts outstanding as of October 2, 2021. During 2021, a 10 increase or decrease in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies to which we are typically exposed would not have had a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 YEARS ENDED OCTOBER 2, 2021, October 3, 2020 AND SEPTEMBER 28, 2019 

The discount rate we utilize for determining net periodic pension cost and the related benefit obligation for the SRBAs is based, in part, on current interest rates earned on long-term bonds that receive one of the two highest ratings assigned by recognized rating agencies. Our discount rate assumptions are adjusted as of each valuation date to reflect current interest rates on such long-term bonds. The discount rate is used to determine the actuarial present value of the benefit obligations as of the valuation date as well as the interest component of the net periodic pension cost for the following year. We currently expect net periodic pension cost for 2022 to be million for the SRBAs. Cash contributions to the SRBAs during 2022 are expected to be . The assumed discount rate is reevaluated annually. A reduction in the assumed discount rate generally results in an actuarial loss, as the actuarially-determined present value of estimated future benefit payments will increase. Conversely, an increase in the assumed discount rate generally results in an actuarial gain. However, any actuarial gains generated in future periods reduce the negative amortization effect of any cumulative unamortized actuarial losses, while any actuarial losses generated in future periods reduce the favorable amortization effect of any cumulative unamortized actuarial gains. The projected benefit obligations and net periodic pension cost for the SRBAs are based in part on expected increases in future compensation levels. Our assumption for the expected increase in future compensation levels is based upon our average historical experience and our intentions regarding future compensation increases, which generally approximates average long-term inflation rates. A decrease in the assumed discount rate for our SRBAs would have increased our projected and accumulated benefit obligations as of October 2, 2021 by approximately and , respectively, and our expected net periodic pension cost for 2022 by approximately 39,000. 

- years; buildings, - years; and land improvements, - years. Depreciation expense was approximately million in 2021, million in 2020 and million in 2019 and reflected in cost of sales and selling, general and administrative expense SG A expense in the consolidated statements of operations. Capitalized software is amortized over the shorter of the estimated useful life or years and reflected in SG A expense. interest costs were capitalized in 2021, 2020 and 2019. 

and million were recorded in 2021 and 2020, respectively, related to the impairment of long-lived assets resulting from the consolidation of our PC strand operations with the closure of our Summerville, South Carolina facility (see Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements). There were no impairment losses in 2019. 

In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020 - 04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848 ): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting. ASU No. 2020 - 04 provides optional expedients and exceptions to account for contracts, hedging relationships and other transactions that reference LIBOR or another reference rate if certain criteria are met. ASU No. 2020 - 04 is effective March 12, 2020 through December 31, 2022. The adoption of this guidance will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and disclosures. 

million, reflecting certain post-closing adjustments (the STM Acquisition ), which included a million holdback that was payable one year from the acquisition date. 
 
 STM was a leading manufacturer of PC strand for concrete construction applications. We acquired, among other assets, STM s accounts receivable, inventories, production equipment and facility located in Summerville, South Carolina, and assumed certain of its accounts payable and accrued liabilities. The STM Acquisition serves to strengthen our competitive position as we contend with increased low-priced import competition. 

Following is a summary of the adjusted purchase price to the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date: 

Inventories 
 Other current assets 
 Property, plant and equipment 
 Intangibles 
 Total assets acquired 
 
 Liabilities assumed: 
 Accounts payable 
 Accrued expenses 
 Total liabilities assumed 
 Net assets acquired 
 Adjusted purchase price 
 Goodwill 

In connection with the STM Acquisition, we acquired certain intangible assets including customer relationships, a trade name and non-competition agreement. Goodwill associated with the STM Acquisition, which is deductible for tax purposes, consists largely of the synergies we expect to realize through the integration of the acquired assets with our operations. 
 
 The STM Acquisition was accounted for as a business purchase pursuant to ASC Topic 805, Business Combinations ASC 805 ). Under the provisions of ASC 805, acquisition and integration costs are recorded as expenses in the period in which such costs are incurred rather than included as components of consideration transferred. 
 
 Following the STM Acquisition, net sales of the STM facility in 2020 were approximately million. The actual net sales specifically attributable to the STM Acquisition, however, cannot be quantified due to our integration efforts which involved the reassignment of business between the former STM facility and our existing PC strand facilities. As a result, we have determined that the presentation of STM s earnings for 2020 is impractical due to the integration of STM s operations following the STM Acquisition. 
 
 The following unaudited supplemental pro forma financial information reflects our combined results of operations had the STM Acquisition occurred at the beginning of 2019. The pro forma information reflects certain adjustments related to the STM Acquisition, including adjusted amortization and depreciation expense based on the fair values of the assets acquired. The pro forma information does not reflect any potential operating efficiencies or cost savings that may result from the STM Acquisition. Accordingly, this pro forma information is for illustrative purposes and is not intended to represent the actual results of operations of the combined company that would have been achieved had the STM Acquisition occurred at the beginning of 2019, nor is it intended to indicate future results of operations. The pro forma combined results of operations for the current and comparative prior year periods are as follows: 

Earnings before income taxes 
 Net earnings 

Restructuring charges. In connection with the STM acquisition, we elected to consolidate our PC strand operations through the closure of the Summerville facility and the redeployment of its equipment to our other three PC strand production facilities located in Gallatin, Tennessee; Houston, Texas; and Sanderson, Florida. Operations at the Summerville facility ceased during the third quarter of 2020. Following is a summary of the restructuring activity during 2021 and 2020: 

Restructuring charges, net 
 Cash payments 
 Non-cash charges 
 Liability as of October 2, 2021 
 
 2020 
 Restructuring charges, net 
 Cash payments 
 Non-cash charges 
 Liability as of October 3, 2020 

During 2021, we determined the carrying value of the Summerville facility acquired in the STM Acquisition exceeded its fair value, less estimated costs to sell, and recorded an impairment of assets held for sale of million within restructuring charges on our consolidated statements of operations for the year. As of October 2, 2021 and October 3, 2020, we recorded a liability of and , respectively, for restructuring liabilities in accrued expenses on our consolidated balance sheet. We do not currently expect to incur any significant restructuring charges during 2022. 
 
 Acquisition costs. During 2020, we recorded of acquisition-related costs associated with the STM Acquisition for accounting, legal and other professional fees. 

As of October 2, 2021 and October 3, 2020, we held financial assets that are required to be measured at fair value on a recurring basis, which are summarized below: 

Other assets: 
 Cash surrender value of life insurance policies 
 Total 
 
 As of October 3, 2020: 
 Current assets: 
 Cash equivalents 
 Other assets: 
 Cash surrender value of life insurance policies 
 Total 

Cash equivalents, which include all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less, are classified as Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. The carrying amount of our cash equivalents, which consist of investments in money market funds, approximates fair value due to their short maturities. Cash surrender value of life insurance policies are classified as Level 2. The fair value of the life insurance policies was determined by the underwriting insurance company s valuation models and represents the guaranteed value we would receive upon surrender of these policies as of the reporting date. 
 
 As of October 2, 2021 and October 3, 2020, we had nonfinancial assets that are required to be measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis other than the assets and liabilities that were acquired from STM at fair value in 2020 (see Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements). During 2021, we recognized million of impairment charges related to the Summerville facility acquired in the STM Acquisition to reflect its fair value of million as of October 2, 2021. The Summerville facility was classified as assets held for sale in other assets on our consolidated balance sheet as of October 2, 2021. The carrying amounts of accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate fair value due to the short-term maturities of these financial instruments.

million revolving credit facility (the Credit Facility that is used to supplement our operating cash flow and fund our working capital, capital expenditure, general corporate and growth requirements. In May 2019, we entered into a new credit agreement, which amended and restated in its entirety the previous agreement pertaining to the revolving credit facility that had been in effect since June 2010. The new credit agreement, among other changes, extended the maturity date of the Credit Facility from May 13, 2020 to May 15, 2024 and provided for an accordion feature whereby its size may be increased by up to million, subject to our lender s approval. Advances under the Credit Facility are limited to the lesser of the revolving loan commitment amount (currently 100.0 million) or a borrowing base amount that is calculated based upon a percentage of eligible receivables and inventories. As of October 2, 2021, borrowings were outstanding on the Credit Facility, million of borrowing capacity was available and outstanding letters of credit totaled million. As of October 3, 2020, there were borrowings outstanding on the Credit Facility. 
 
 Interest rates on the Credit Facility are based upon 1 an index rate that is established at the highest of the prime rate, plus the federal funds rate or the LIBOR rate plus the excess of the then-applicable margin for LIBOR loans over the then-applicable margin for index rate loans, or 2 at our election, a LIBOR rate, plus in either case, an applicable interest rate margin. The applicable interest rate margins are adjusted on a quarterly basis based upon the amount of excess availability on the Credit Facility within the range of to for index rate loans and to for LIBOR loans. In addition, the applicable interest rate margins would be increased by upon the occurrence of certain events of default provided for under the terms of the Credit Facility. Based on our excess availability as of October 2, 2021, the applicable interest rate margins on the Credit Facility were for index rate loans and for LIBOR loans. 
 
 Our ability to borrow available amounts under the Credit Facility will be restricted or eliminated in the event of certain covenant breaches, events of default or if we are unable to make certain representations and warranties provided for under the terms of the Credit Facility. We are required to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than at the end of each fiscal quarter for the twelve -month period then ended when the amount of liquidity on the Credit Facility is less than million. In addition, the terms of the Credit Facility restrict our ability to, among other things: engage in certain business combinations or divestitures; make investments in or loans to third parties, unless certain conditions are met with respect to such investments or loans; pay cash dividends or repurchase shares of our stock subject to certain minimum borrowing availability requirements; incur or assume indebtedness; issue securities; enter into certain transactions with our affiliates; or permit liens to encumber our property and assets. The terms of the Credit Facility also provide that an event of default will occur upon the occurrence of, among other things: defaults or breaches under the loan documents, subject in certain cases to cure periods; defaults or breaches by us or any of our subsidiaries under any agreement resulting in the acceleration of amounts above certain thresholds or payment defaults above certain thresholds; certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency; certain entries of judgment against us or any of our subsidiaries, which are not covered by insurance; or a change of control. As of October 2, 2021, we were in compliance with all of the financial and negative covenants under the Credit Facility and there have not been any events of default. 
 
 Amortization of capitalized financing costs associated with the Credit Facility was in 2021, in 2020 and in 2019. We expect the amortization of capitalized financing costs to approximate the following amounts for the next five fiscal years: 

2023

shares of our common stock for future grants under the plan and expires on February 17, 2025. As of October 2, 2021, there were shares of our common stock available for future grants under the 2015 Plan, which is our only active equity incentive plan. 

Stock option awards . Under our equity incentive plan, employees and directors may be granted options to purchase shares of common stock at the fair market value on the date of the grant. Options granted under the plan generally vest over three years and expire ten years from the date of the grant. Compensation expense associated with stock options was in 2021, in 2020 and in 2019. As of October 2, 2021, there was of unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested options which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years. 
 
 The fair value of each option award granted is estimated on the date of grant using a Monte Carlo valuation model. The weighted-average estimated fair values of stock options granted during 2021, 2020 and 2019 were , and per share, respectively, based on the following weighted-average assumptions: 

Risk-free interest rate 
 Expected volatility 
 Expected dividend yield 

The assumptions utilized in the Monte Carlo valuation model are evaluated and revised, as necessary, to reflect market conditions and actual historical experience. The expected term for options was based on the results of a Monte Carlo simulation model, using the model s estimated fair value as an input to the Black-Scholes-Merton model, and then solving for the expected term. The risk-free interest rate for periods within the contractual life of the option was based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of the grant. The expected volatility was derived using a term structure based on historical volatility and the volatility implied by exchange-traded options on our common stock. The dividend yield was calculated based on our annual dividend as of the option grant date.

Stock option exercises include net exercises for which the optionee received shares of common stock equal to the intrinsic value of the options (fair market value of common stock on the date of exercise less exercise price) reduced by any applicable withholding taxes. 

Restricted stock units. Restricted stock units RSUs granted under our equity incentive plan are valued based upon the fair market value on the date of the grant and provide for a dividend equivalent payment which is included in compensation expense. The vesting period for RSUs is generally one year from the date of the grant for RSUs granted to directors and three years from the date of the grant for RSUs granted to employees. RSUs do not have voting rights. RSU grants and compensation expense are as follows:

 Net deferred tax liability 

On March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act ("CARES Act") was signed into law. The CARES Act includes several changes impacting business, including, but not limited to, enhanced business interest deductibility, net operating loss ("NOL") carryback provisions, payroll tax deferral provisions and employee retention tax credits. We recorded a tax benefit in 2020 resulting from the NOL carryback provisions of the CARES Act. 

As of October 2, 2021 and October 3, 2020, we recorded deferred tax liabilities (net of valuation allowances) of million and million, respectively, in other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet. We have million of state NOLs that begin to expire in 2031, but principally expire between 2031 and 2036. 
 
 The realization of our deferred tax assets is entirely dependent upon our ability to generate future taxable income in applicable jurisdictions. GAAP requires that we periodically assess the need to establish a reserve against our deferred tax assets to the extent we no longer believe it is more likely than not that they will be fully realized. As of October 2, 2021, we recorded a valuation allowance of pertaining to various state NOLs that were not expected to be utilized. The valuation allowance is subject to periodic review and adjustment based on changes in facts and circumstances and would be reduced should we utilize the state NOLs and tax credits against which an allowance had previously been provided or determine that such utilization was more likely than not. The decrease in the valuation allowance during 2021 is primarily due to the utilization of state NOLs for which an allowance had been recorded together with a reduction in state apportionment rates. 
 
 As of October 2, 2021, we had no material, known tax exposures that required the establishment of contingency reserves for uncertain tax positions. 
 
 We classify interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as part of income tax expense. There were interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits incurred during 2021, 2020 and 2019. 
 
 We file U.S. federal income tax returns as well as state and local income tax returns in various jurisdictions. Federal and various state tax returns filed subsequent to 2016 remain subject to examination. 

years, we will pay the Participant a supplemental retirement benefit for the -year period following the Participant s retirement equal to of the Participant s highest average annual base salary for five consecutive years in the -year period preceding the Participant s retirement. If the Participant retires prior to the later of age or the completion of 30 years of continuous service with us, but has completed at least years of continuous service, the amount of the Participant s supplemental retirement benefit will be reduced by 1/360th for each month short of 30 years that the Participant was employed by us.

 The accumulated benefit obligation was million and million as of October 2, 2021 and October 3, 2020, respectively. 
 
 Net periodic pension cost for the SRBAs includes the following components:

 Amortization of net loss 
 Net periodic pension cost 

The assumptions used in the valuation of the SRBAs are as follows: 

Rate of increase in compensation levels 

The assumed discount rate is established as of our fiscal year-end measurement date. In establishing the discount rate, we review published market indices of high-quality debt securities, adjusted as appropriate for duration, and high-quality bond yield curves applicable to the expected benefit payments of the SRBAs. The SRBAs expected rate of increase in compensation levels is based on the anticipated increases in annual compensation. 
 
 The projected benefit payments under the SRBAs are as follows:

Retirement savings plan. In 1996, we adopted the Retirement Savings Plan of Insteel Industries, Inc. (the Plan to provide retirement benefits and stock ownership for our employees. The Plan is an amendment and restatement of our Employee Stock Ownership Plan. As allowed under Sections 401 (a) and 401 (k) of the Internal Revenue Code, the Plan provides for tax-deferred salary deductions for eligible employees. 
 
 The Plan allows for discretionary contributions to be made by us as determined by the Board of Directors, which are allocated among eligible participants based on their compensation relative to the total compensation of all participants . Employees are permitted to contribute up to of their annual compensation to the Plan, limited to a maximum annual amount as set periodically by the Internal Revenue Code. We match employee contributions up to of the first and of the next of eligible compensation that is contributed by employees. Our contributions to the Plan were million in 2021, million in 2020 and million in 2019. 
 
 Voluntary Employee Beneficiary Associations VEBA . We have a VEBA which allows both us and our employees to make contributions to pay for medical costs. Our contributions to the VEBA were million in 2021, million in 2020 and million in 2019. We are primarily self-insured for our employee s healthcare costs, carrying stop-loss insurance coverage for individual claims in excess of per benefit plan year. Our self-insurance liabilities are based on the total estimated costs of claims filed and claims incurred but not reported, less amounts paid against such claims. We review current and historical claims data in developing our estimates. 

million of insurance proceeds related to the claim that was partially applied against the beginning receivable balance of with the remainder recorded in other income million), cost of sales and SG A expense on the consolidated statements of operations. 

In August 2017, operations at our manufacturing facility located in Dayton, Texas were adversely affected by hurricane Harvey. We reached a final settlement on the property damage and business interruption claim with our insurance carrier in 2019. During 2019, we received of proceeds related to this claim of which was recorded in other income on the consolidated statements of operations. 
 
 The insurance proceeds attributable to the property and equipment damaged are reported in cash flows from investing activities and all other insurance proceeds received are reported in cash flows from operating activities on the consolidated statements of cash flows. 
 
 Purchase commitments . As of October 2, 2021, we had million in non-cancelable purchase commitments for raw material extending as long as approximately days and million of contractual commitments for the purchase of certain equipment that had not been fulfilled and are not reflected in our consolidated financial statements. 
 
 Legal proceedings . We are involved in lawsuits, claims, investigations and proceedings, including commercial, environmental and employment matters, which arise in the ordinary course of business. We do not expect the ultimate outcome or cost to resolve these matters will have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 
 
 Severance and change of control agreements. We have entered into a severance agreement with our Chief Executive Officer that provides him with certain termination benefits in the event his employment with us is terminated without cause. The initial term of the agreement was two years and it automatically renews for successive one year terms unless we or our Chief Executive Officer provide notice of termination as specified in the agreement. In the event of termination of the Chief Executive Officer s employment without cause, this agreement provides that he would receive termination benefits equal to one and one -half times his annual base salary in effect on the termination date and the continuation of health and welfare benefits for eighteen months. In addition, all of his stock options and restricted stock would vest immediately, and outplacement services would be provided. 
 
 We have also entered into change in control agreements with key members of management, including our executive officers, which specify the terms of separation in the event that termination of their employment followed a change in control. The initial term of each agreement is two years and they automatically renew for successive one year terms unless we or the executive provide notice of termination as specified in the agreement. The agreements do not provide assurances of continued employment or specify the terms of an executive s termination should one occur in the absence of a change in control. The compensation payable under the terms of these agreements differs between the Chief Executive Officer and the other covered executives. In the event of termination of the Chief Executive Officer within two years of a change of control, he would receive severance benefits equal to two times base compensation, two times the average bonus for the prior three years and the continuation of health and welfare benefits for two years. In the event of such a termination of the other key members of management, including our other three executive officers, within two years of a change of control, they would receive severance benefits equal to one times base compensation, one times the average bonus for the prior three years and the continuation of health and welfare benefits for one year. In addition, for any covered executive that is terminated within two years of a change of control, all of their stock options and restricted stock would vest immediately, and outplacement services would be provided.

 Most of our leases include options to extend or terminate the leases which are exercised at our sole discretion. As most of our leases do not provide an implicit interest rate, we use our incremental borrowing rate as of the commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments, which represents an estimate of the interest rate we would incur at the lease commencement to borrow an amount equal to the lease payments on a collateralized basis over the term.

 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 We have conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of October 2, 2021. This evaluation was conducted under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer. Based upon that evaluation, our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Commission s rules and forms.

 Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. 
 
 Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a process to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of our financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Internal control over financial reporting includes: (1) maintaining records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of assets; (2) providing reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures are made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors; and (3) providing reasonable assurance that unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of assets that could have a material effect on financial statements would be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting can only provide reasonable assurance that a misstatement of financial statements would be prevented or detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
 
 Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in the 2013 Internal Control Integrated Framework. Based on this assessment, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of October 2, 2021. During the quarter ended October 2, 2021, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 
 Our independent registered public accounting firm has issued an audit report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of October 2, 2021, which appears below.

 We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) PCAOB ), the consolidated financial statements of the Company as of and for the year ended October 2, 2021, and our report dated October 28, 2021 expressed an unqualified on those financial statements. 
 
 Basis for opinion 
 
 The Company s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management s Reports on Internal Control over Financial Reporting . Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 
 We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 
 Definition and limitations of internal control over financial reporting 
 
 A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
