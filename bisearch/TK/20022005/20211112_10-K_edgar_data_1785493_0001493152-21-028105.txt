As
of July 31, 2021, we had 332,699,500 shares of our Common Stock par value, .0001 issued and outstanding. There were 123 beneficial owners

The
transfer agent for our capital stock is VStock Transfer, LLC, with an address at 18, Lafayette Place, Woodmere, New York 11598 and telephone
number is +1 (212)828-843. 

Penny
Stock Regulations 

The
Securities and Exchange Commission has adopted regulations which generally define penny stock to be an equity security
that has a market price of less than 5.00 per share. Our Common Stock, when and if a trading market develops, may fall within the definition
of penny stock and be subject to rules that impose additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers who sell such securities
to persons other than established customers and accredited investors (generally those with assets in excess of 1,000,000, or annual
incomes exceeding 200,000 individually, or 300,000, together with their spouse). 

For
transactions covered by these rules, the broker-dealer must make a special suitability determination for the purchase of such securities
and have received the purchaser s prior written consent to the transaction. Additionally, for any transaction, other than exempt
transactions, involving a penny stock, the rules require the delivery, prior to the transaction, of a risk disclosure document mandated
by the Securities and Exchange Commission relating to the penny stock market. The broker-dealer also must disclose the commissions payable
to both the broker-dealer and the registered representative, current quotations for the securities and, if the broker-dealer is the sole
market-maker, the broker-dealer must disclose this fact and the broker-dealer s presumed control over the market. Finally, monthly
statements must be sent disclosing recent price information for the penny stock held in the account and information on the limited market
in penny stocks. Consequently, the penny stock rules may restrict the ability of broker-dealers to sell our Common Stock
and may affect the ability of investors to sell their Common Stock in the secondary market. 

In
addition to the penny stock rules promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Financial Industry Regulatory
Authority FINRA has adopted rules that require that in recommending an investment to a customer, a broker-dealer must
have reasonable grounds for believing that the investment is suitable for that customer. Prior to recommending speculative low priced
securities to their non-institutional customers, broker-dealers must make reasonable efforts to obtain information about the customer s
financial status, tax status, investment objectives and other information. Under interpretations of these rules, FINRA believes that
there is a high probability that speculative low-priced securities will not be suitable for at least some customers. The FINRA requirements
make it more difficult for broker-dealers to recommend that their customers buy our common stock, which may limit the investors 
ability to buy and sell our stock. 

Dividend
Policy 

Any
future determination as to the declaration and payment of dividends on shares of our Common Stock will be made at the discretion of our
board of directors out of funds legally available for such purpose. We are under no obligations or restrictions to declare or pay dividends
on our shares of Common Stock. In addition, we currently have no plans to pay such dividends. Our board of directors currently intends
to retain all earnings for use in the business for the foreseeable future. 

Equity
Compensation Plan Information 

Currently,
there is no equity compensation plan in place. 

Unregistered
Sales of Equity Securities 

Currently,
there is no unregistered sales of equity securities.

Purchases
of Equity Securities by the Registrant and Affiliated Purchasers

Company generates gross profits of 12,480 and 22,588 for the year ended July 31, 2021 and 2020. 

Selling
and Marketing Expenses 

Selling
and distribution expenses for the year ended July 31, 2021 and 2020 amounted to 40,457 and 292,911 respectively. These expenses
comprised expenses on website and website maintenance, marketing and networking event, and travelling expenses. 

General
and Administrative Expenses 

General
and administrative expenses for the year ended July 31, 2021 and 2020 amounted to 192,994 and 481,024 respectively. These expenses
are comprised of salary, consultancy fees for listing advisory, professional fee, compliance fee, office and outlet operation expenses
and depreciation. 

Other
operating expenses 

Other
operating expenses for the year ended July 31, 2021 and 2020 amounted to 180,058 and 72,004 respectively. These expenses derived from
lease interest, depreciation, amortization and foreign exchange loss. 

Other

The

The decrease in net loss of 458,669 can be contributed to the substantial decrease in selling and distribution expenses

increased levels of operations going forward will result in more significant cash flow and in turn working. 

We
depend substantially on financing activities to provide us with the liquidity and capital resources we need to meet our working capital
requirements and to make capital investments in connection with ongoing operations. During the year ended July 31, 2021, we have met
these requirements primarily from the receipt of subscription for private placement and share subscription from Initial Public Offering
(IPO), which has yet to be allotted.

Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates 

Basis
of presentation 

The
consolidated financial statements for Phoenix Plus Corp. and its subsidiaries for the year ended July 31, 2021 is prepared in accordance
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America US GAAP and include the accounts of Phoenix
Plus Corp. and its wholly owned subsidiaries, Phoenix Plus Corp. and Phoenix Plus International Limited. Intercompany accounts and transactions
have been eliminated on consolidation. The Company has adopted July 31 as its fiscal year end. 

Basis
of consolidation 

The
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries. All inter-company accounts and transactions
have been eliminated upon consolidation. 

Use
of estimates 

Management
uses estimates and assumptions in preparing these financial statements in accordance with US GAAP. Those estimates and assumptions affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in the balance sheets, and the reported
revenue and expenses during the year reported. Actual results may differ from these estimates. 

Cash
and cash equivalents 

Cash
and cash equivalents are carried at cost and represent cash on hand, demand deposits placed with banks or other financial institutions
and all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less as of the purchase date of such investments. 

Revenue
recognition 

In
accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB Accounting Standards Codification ASC Topic
606, Revenue from Contracts . ASC 606 creates a five-step model that requires entities to exercise judgment when considering the
terms of contracts, which includes (1) identifying the contracts or agreements with a customer, (2) identifying our performance obligations
in the contract or agreement, (3) determining the transaction price, (4) allocating the transaction price to the separate performance
obligations, and (5) recognizing revenue as each performance obligation is satisfied. The Company only applies the five-step model to
contracts when it is probable that the Company will collect the consideration it is entitled to in exchange for the services it transfers
to its clients. 

Revenue
is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, net of discounts and taxes applicable to the revenue. The
Company derives its revenue from provision of technical consultancy on solar power system and consultancy on green energy solution. 

Cost
of revenue 

Cost
of revenue includes the cost of services in providing business mentoring, nurturing, incubating and corporate development advisory services 

Income
taxes 

Income
taxes are determined in accordance with the provisions of ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes ASC Topic 740 ).
Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between
the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. Deferred tax assets and liabilities
are measured using enacted income tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the year in which those temporary differences are
expected to be recovered or settled. Any effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income
in the year that includes the enactment date. 

ASC
740 prescribes a comprehensive model for how companies should recognize, measure, present, and disclose in their financial statements
uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return. Under ASC 740, tax positions must initially be recognized in the
financial statements when it is more likely than not the position will be sustained upon examination by the tax authorities. Such tax
positions must initially and subsequently be measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of
being realized upon ultimate settlement with the tax authority assuming full knowledge of the position and relevant facts.

Net
loss per share 

The
Company calculates net loss per share in accordance with ASC Topic 260, Earnings per Share. Basic loss
per share is computed by dividing the net loss by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the year.
Diluted income per share is computed similar to basic loss per share except that the denominator is increased to include the
number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the potential common stock equivalents had been issued and if
the additional common shares were dilutive. 

Foreign
currencies translation 

Transactions
denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rates prevailing
at the dates of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are translated
into the functional currency using the applicable exchange rates at the balance sheet dates. The resulting exchange differences are recorded
in the statements of operations. 

The
reporting currency of the Company is United States Dollars US ). The Company s subsidiary in Labuan and Hong Kong
maintains its books and record in United States Dollars US respectively, and Ringgits Malaysia MYR is
functional currency as being the primary currency of the economic environment in which the entity operates. 

In
general, for consolidation purposes, assets and liabilities of its subsidiary whose functional currency is not the US are translated
into US , in accordance with ASC Topic 830-30, Translation of Financial Statement , using the exchange rate on the
balance sheet date. Revenues and expenses are translated at average rates prevailing during the year. The gains and losses resulting
from translation of financial statements of foreign subsidiary are recorded as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive
income within the statement of stockholders equity. 

Translation
of amounts from MYR into US 1 and HK into US 1 has been made at the following exchange rates for the respective year:

Related
parties 

Parties,
which can be a corporation or individual, are considered to be related if the Company has the ability, directly or indirectly, to control
the other party or exercise significant influence over the other party in making financial and operating decisions. Companies are also
considered to be related if they are subject to common control or common significant influence. 

Fair
value of financial instruments: 

The
carrying value of the Company s financial instruments: cash and cash equivalents, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, and
amount due to a director approximate at their fair values because of the short-term nature of these financial instruments. 

The
Company also follows the guidance of the ASC Topic 820-10, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures ASC 820-10 ),
with respect to financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value. ASC 820-10 establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy
that prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows: 

Level
 1: Observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; 

Level
 2: Inputs, other than the quoted prices in active markets, that are observable either directly or indirectly; and 

Level
 3: Unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data, which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions. 

Recent
accounting pronouncements 

FASB
issues various Accounting Standards Updates relating to the treatment and recording of certain accounting transactions. On June 10, 2014,
the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2014-10, Development Stage Entities (Topic
915) Elimination of Certain Financial Reporting Requirements, including an Amendment to Variable Interest Entities Guidance in Topic
810, Consolidation , which eliminates the concept of a development stage entity (DSE) entirely from current accounting guidance.
The Company has elected adoption of this standard, which eliminates the designation of DSEs and the requirement to disclose results of
operations and cash flows since inception. 

The
Company has reviewed all recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting pronouncements and do not believe the future adoption of
any such pronouncements may be expected to cause a material impact on its financial condition or the results of its operations.

Control and Procedures 

We
carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange

as of July 31, 2021, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective: (i) inadequate segregation of duties and effective risk
assessment; and (ii) insufficient written policies and procedures for accounting and financial reporting with respect to the requirements
and application of both US GAAP and SEC guidelines.

Our
executive officer s and director s and their respective ages as of the date hereof are as follows: 

NAME 
 
 AGE 
 
 POSITION 
 
 Fong
 Teck Kheong 
 
 53 
 
 Chief
 Executive Officer, President, Secretary, Treasurer, Director 

Set
forth below is a brief description of the background and business experience of our executive officer and director for the past five
years. 

Fong
Teck Kheong President, Chief Executive Officer, Secretary, Treasurer, Director 

Mr
Fong started off his career as a trader in 1989. In 1992, he then joined Juara Konsep Marketing Sdn. Bhd, as a marketing manager to manage
and market the products and services of the company. In 1998, Mr Fong resigned from Juana Konsep Marketing Sdn. Bhd and started his own
cookware and healthcare equipment trading business, Phoenix Century Enterprise, and remained with the company until his resignation in
2007. Also in 1998, he also established, and remains with to this day, Multi Mutual Charity Association, a Non-Profit Organization (NGO)
that provides daily necessities for monthly aid distribution to women and children. The association supported more than 500 hundred single
mother family during the period from 1998 to 2012. 

Mr
Fong was awarded The Outstanding Young Malaysia Award for his contribution to children, world peace and human rights in 2007. In 2015,
Mr. Fong founded Phoenix Plus Properties Sdn Bhd, formerly known as Googoplex Sk Sdn Bhd, with full swing involve in the real estate
business. The company s business plan involves project sales and sub sales, and has since accumulated turnover of up to RM260 millions.
He has been the Managing Director of the company from 2015 to present.

Corporate
Governance 

The
Company promotes accountability for adherence to honest and ethical conduct; endeavors to provide full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable
disclosure in reports and documents that the Company files with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC and in
other public communications made by the Company; and strives to be compliant with applicable governmental laws, rules and regulations.
The Company has not formally adopted a written code of business conduct and ethics that governs the Company s employees, officers
and Directors as the Company is not required to do so. 

In
lieu of an Audit Committee, the Company s Board of Directors, is responsible for reviewing and making recommendations concerning
the selection of outside auditors, reviewing the scope, results and effectiveness of the annual audit of the Company s financial
statements and other services provided by the Company s independent public accountants. The Board of Directors, the Chief Executive
Officer and the Chief Financial Officer of the Company review the Company s internal accounting controls, practices and policies. 

Committees
of the Board 

Our
Company currently does not have nominating, compensation, or audit committees or committees performing similar functions nor does our
Company have a written nominating, compensation or audit committee charter. Our Directors believes that it is not necessary to have such
committees, at this time, because the Director(s) can adequately perform the functions of such committees. 

Audit
Committee Financial Expert 

Our
Board of Directors has determined that we do not have a board member that qualifies as an audit committee financial expert 
as defined in Item 407(D)(5) of Regulation S-K, nor do we have a Board member that qualifies as independent as the term
is used in Item 7(d)(3)(iv)(B) of Schedule 14A under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and as defined by Rule 4200(a)(14)
of the FINRA Rules. 

We
believe that our Director(s) are capable of analyzing and evaluating our financial statements and understanding internal controls and
procedures for financial reporting. The Director(s) of our Company does not believe that it is necessary to have an audit committee because
management believes that the Board of Directors can adequately perform the functions of an audit committee. In addition, we believe that
retaining an independent Director who would qualify as an audit committee financial expert would be overly costly and burdensome
and is not warranted in our circumstances given the stage of our development and the fact that we have not generated any positive cash
flows from operations to date. 

Involvement
in Certain Legal Proceedings 

Our
Directors and our Executive officers have not been involved in any of the following events during the past ten years: 

1. 
 bankruptcy
 petition filed by or against any business of which such person was a general partner or executive officer either at the time of the
 bankruptcy or within two years prior to that time; 
 
 2. 
 any
 conviction in a criminal proceeding or being subject to a pending criminal proceeding (excluding traffic violations and other minor
 offenses); 
 
 3. 
 being
 subject to any order, judgment, or decree, not subsequently reversed, suspended or vacated, of any court of competent jurisdiction,
 permanently or temporarily enjoining, barring, suspending or otherwise limiting his/her involvement in any type of business, securities
 or banking activities; or 
 
 4. 
 being
 found by a court of competent jurisdiction (in a civil action), the Commission or the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to have
 violated a federal or state securities or commodities law, and the judgment has not been reversed, suspended, or vacated. 
 
 5. 
 Such
 person was found by a court of competent jurisdiction in a civil action or by the Commission to have violated any Federal or State
 securities law, and the judgment in such civil action or finding by the Commission has not been subsequently reversed, suspended,
 or vacated; 
 
 6. 
 Such
 person was found by a court of competent jurisdiction in a civil action or by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to have violated
 any Federal commodities law, and the judgment in such civil action or finding by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission has not
 been subsequently reversed, suspended or vacated; 
 
 7. 
 Such
 person was the subject of, or a party to, any Federal or State judicial or administrative order, judgment, decree, or finding, not
 subsequently reversed, suspended or vacated, relating to an alleged violation of:(i) Any Federal or State securities or commodities
 law or regulation; or(ii) Any law or regulation respecting financial institutions or insurance companies including, but not limited
 to, a temporary or permanent injunction, order of disgorgement or restitution, civil money penalty or temporary or permanent cease-and-desist
 order, or removal or prohibition order; or(iii) Any law or regulation prohibiting mail or wire fraud or fraud in connection with
 any business entity; or 
 
 8. 
 Such
 person was the subject of, or a party to, any sanction or order, not subsequently reversed, suspended or vacated, of any self-regulatory
 organization (as defined in Section 3(a)(26) of the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(26))), any registered entity (as defined in Section
 1(a)(29) of the Commodity Exchange Act (7 U.S.C. 1(a)(29))), or any equivalent exchange, association, entity or organization that
 has disciplinary authority over its members or persons associated with a member. 

Independence
of Directors 

We
are not required to have independent members of our Board of Directors, and do not anticipate having independent Directors until such
time as we are required to do so. 

Code
of Ethics 

We
have not adopted a formal Code of Ethics. The Board of Directors evaluated the business of the Company and the number of employees and
determined that since the business is operated by a small number of persons, general rules of fiduciary duty and federal and state criminal,
business conduct and securities laws are adequate ethical guidelines. In the event our operations, employees and/or Directors expand
in the future, we may take actions to adopt a formal Code of Ethics. 

Shareholder
Proposals 

Our
Company does not have any defined policy or procedural requirements for shareholders to submit recommendations or nominations for Directors.
The Board of Directors believes that, given the stage of our development, a specific nominating policy would be premature and of little
assistance until our business operations develop to a more advanced level. Our Company does not currently have any specific or minimum
criteria for the election of nominees to the Board of Directors and we do not have any specific process or procedure for evaluating such
nominees. The Board of Directors will assess all candidates, whether submitted by management or shareholders, and make recommendations
for election or appointment. 

A
shareholder who wishes to communicate with our Board of Directors may do so by directing a written request addressed to our President,
at the address appearing on the first page of this Information Statement.

Beneficial
ownership has been determined in accordance with Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act. Under this rule, certain shares may be deemed to
be beneficially owned by more than one person (if, for example, persons share the power to vote or the power to dispose of the shares).
In addition, shares are deemed to be beneficially owned by a person if the person has the right to acquire shares (for example, upon
exercise of an option or warrant) within 60 days of the date as of which the information is provided. In computing the percentage ownership
of any person, the amount of shares is deemed to include the amount of shares beneficially owned by such person by reason of such acquisition
rights. As a result, the percentage of outstanding shares of any person as shown in the following table does not necessarily reflect
the person s actual voting power at any particular date. 

(1) 
 Beneficial
 ownership is determined in accordance with the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission and generally includes voting or investment
 power with respect to securities. Beneficial ownership also includes shares of stock subject to options and warrants currently exercisable
 or exercisable within 60 days of the date of this table. In determining the percent of common stock owned by a person or entity as
 of the date of this Report, (a) the numerator is the number of shares of the class beneficially owned by such person or entity, including
 shares which may be acquired within 60 days on exercise of warrants or options and conversion of convertible securities, and (b)
 the denominator is the sum of (i) the total shares of common stock outstanding on as of the date of this Annual Report (92,176,667
 shares), and (ii) the total number of shares that the beneficial owner may acquire upon exercise of the derivative securities. Unless
 otherwise stated, each beneficial owner has sole power to vote and dispose of its shares.

Opinion on the Financial Statements 

We have audited the accompanying
balance sheets of Phoenix Plus Corp. the Company as of July 31, 2021 and the related statements of operations and comprehensive
loss, stockholders equity, and cash flows for the year ended of July 31, 2021, and the related notes (collectively referred to
as the financial statements ). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of the Company as of July 31, 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year ended of July 31, 2021,
in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 

Basis for Opinion 

These financial statements are the responsibility
of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our
audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable
rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We conducted our audits in accordance with the
standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged
to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding
of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s
internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our audits included performing procedures to assess
the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond
to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well
as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion. 

The financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company
will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, for the year ended July 31, 2021 the Company has
net capital and working capital deficit. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a
going concern. Management s plans in regard to these matters also are described in Note 2. The financial statements do not include
any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty 

Critical Audit Matters 

Critical audit matters are matters arising from
the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to those charged with governance
that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging,
subjective, or complex judgements. We determined that there are no critical matters.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 

The
accompanying consolidated financial statements reflect the application of certain significant accounting policies as described in this
note and elsewhere in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes. 

Going
Concern 

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the settlement
of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. As reflected in the accompanying financial statements, for the year
ended July 31, 2021, the Company suffered an accumulated deficit of 1,150,797 and net loss of 338,351. These factors
raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern within one year of the date that the financial
statements are issued. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue
as a going concern. 

The
Company s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon improving its profitability and the continuing financial support
from its shareholders. Management believes the existing shareholders or external financing will provide the additional cash to meet the
Company s obligations as they become due. No assurance can be given that any future financing, if needed, will be available or,
if available, that it will be on terms that are satisfactory to the Company. Even if the Company is able to obtain additional financing,
if needed, it may contain undue restrictions on its operations, in the case of debt financing, or cause substantial dilution for its
stock holders, in the case of equity financing. 

Basis
of presentation 

The
consolidated financial statements for Phoenix Plus Corp. and its subsidiaries for the year ended July 31, 2021 is prepared in accordance
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America US GAAP and include the accounts of Phoenix
Plus Corp. and its wholly owned subsidiaries, Phoenix Plus Corp. and Phoenix Plus International Limited. Intercompany accounts and transactions
have been eliminated on consolidation. The Company has adopted July 31 as its fiscal year end. 

Basis
of consolidation 

The
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries in which the Company is the primary beneficiary.
All inter-company accounts and transactions have been eliminated upon consolidation.

 (Currency

Use
of estimates 

Management
uses estimates and assumptions in preparing these financial statements in accordance with US GAAP. Those estimates and assumptions affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in the balance sheets, and the reported
revenue and expenses during the year reported. Actual results may differ from these estimates. 

Revenue
recognition 

In
accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB Accounting Standards Codification ASC Topic
606, Revenue from Contracts . ASC 606 creates a five-step model that requires entities to exercise judgment when considering the
terms of contracts, which includes (1) identifying the contracts or agreements with a customer, (2) identifying our performance obligations
in the contract or agreement, (3) determining the transaction price, (4) allocating the transaction price to the separate performance
obligations, and (5) recognizing revenue as each performance obligation is satisfied. The Company only applies the five-step model to
contracts when it is probable that the Company will collect the consideration it is entitled to in exchange for the services it transfers
to its clients. 

Revenue
is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, net of discounts and taxes applicable to the revenue. The
Company derives its revenue from provision of technical consultancy on solar power system and consultancy on green energy solution 

Cost
of revenue 

Cost
of revenue includes the cost of services and product in providing business mentoring, nurturing, incubating and corporate development
advisory services 

Cash
and cash equivalents 

Cash
and cash equivalents are carried at cost and represent cash on hand, demand deposits placed with banks or other financial institutions
and all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less as of the purchase date of such investments. 

Property,
plant and equipment 

Property,
plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, if any. Depreciation is
calculated on the straight-line basis over the following expected useful lives from the date on which they become fully operational. 

Expenditures
for maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. The gain or loss on the disposal of plant and equipment is the difference between
the net sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the relevant assets and is recognized in the statement of operations 

Income
taxes 

The
provision of income taxes is determined in accordance with the provisions of ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes ASC 740 ).
Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between
the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. Deferred tax assets and liabilities
are measured using enacted income tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the year in which those temporary differences are
expected to be recovered or settled. Any effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income
in the year that includes the enactment date. 

ASC
740 prescribes a comprehensive model for how companies should recognize, measure, present, and disclose in their financial statements
uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return. Under ASC 740, tax positions must initially be recognized in the
financial statements when it is more likely than not the position will be sustained upon examination by the tax authorities. Such tax
positions must initially and subsequently be measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of
being realized upon ultimate settlement with the tax authority assuming full knowledge of the position and relevant facts.

The
Company calculates net loss per share in accordance with ASC Topic 260 Earnings per share . Basic loss per share
is computed by dividing the net loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the year. Diluted loss per share
is computed similar to basic loss per share except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional common shares
that would have been outstanding if the potential common stock equivalents had been issued and if the additional common shares were dilutive. 

Foreign
currencies translation 

Transactions
denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rates prevailing
at the dates of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are translated
into the functional currency using the applicable exchange rates at the balance sheet dates. The resulting exchange differences are recorded
in the statements of operations. 

The
reporting currency of the Company is United States Dollars US ). The Company s subsidiary in Labuan and Hong Kong
maintains its books and record in United States Dollars US respectively, and Ringgits Malaysia RM is
functional currency as being the primary currency of the economic environment in which the entity operates. 

In
general, for consolidation purposes, assets and liabilities of its subsidiary whose functional currency is not the US are translated
into US , in accordance with ASC Topic 830-30, Translation of Financial Statement , using the exchange rate on the
balance sheet date. Revenues and expenses are translated at average rates prevailing during the year. The gains and losses resulting
from translation of financial statements of foreign subsidiary are recorded as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive
income within the statement of stockholders equity. 

Translation
of amounts from RM into US 1 and HK into US 1 has been made at the following exchange rates for the respective years: 

As of and for the year ended July 31,

Fair
value of financial instruments: 

The
carrying value of the Company s financial instruments: cash and cash equivalents, prepayment, deposits, accounts payable and accrued
liabilities and amount due to a director approximate at their fair values because of the short-term nature of these financial instruments. 

The
Company also follows the guidance of the ASC Topic 820-10, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures ASC 820-10 ),
with respect to financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value. ASC 820-10 establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy
that prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows: 

Level
1 : Observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; 

Level
2 : Inputs, other than the quoted prices in active markets, that are observable either directly or indirectly; and 

Level
3: Unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data, which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions. 

Leases 

Prior
to August 1, 2019, the Company accounted for leases under ASC 840, Accounting for Leases . Effective August 1, 2019, the Company
adopted the guidance of ASC 842, Leases, which requires an entity to recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for
virtually all leases. The implementation of ASC 842 did not have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements
and did not have a significant impact on our liquidity. The Company adopted ASC 842 using a modified retrospective approach. As a result,
the comparative financial information has not been updated and the required disclosures prior to the date of adoption have not been updated
and continue to be reported under the accounting standards in effect for those years. (See Note 11) 

Recent
accounting pronouncements 

ASB
issues various Accounting Standards Updates relating to the treatment and recording of certain accounting transactions. On June 10, 2014,
the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2014-10, Development Stage Entities (Topic 915)
Elimination of Certain Financial Reporting Requirements, including an Amendment to Variable Interest Entities Guidance in Topic 810,
Consolidation, which eliminates the concept of a development stage entity (DSE) entirely from current accounting guidance. The Company
has elected adoption of this standard, which eliminates the designation of DSEs and the requirement to disclose results of operations
and cash flows since inception. 

The
Company has reviewed all recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting pronouncements and do not believe the future adoption of
any such pronouncements may be expected to cause a material impact on its financial condition or the results of its operations.
