 the effects of and changes in monetary and fiscal policies of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and the U.S. Government, including responses to the COVID-19 pandemic; 
 fluctuations in interest rate risk and changes in market interest rates, including risk related to LIBOR reform and risk of negative rates; 
 the Company's ability to make accurate assumptions and judgments about the collectability of its loan portfolio, including the creditworthiness of its borrowers and the value of the assets securing these loans; 
 legislative and regulatory limitations, including those arising under the Dodd-Frank Act and potential limitations 
 in the manner in which the Company conducts its business and undertakes new investments and activities; 
 the ability of the Company to obtain external financing to fund its operations or obtain this financing on favorable terms; 
 changes in other economic, competitive, governmental, regulatory and technological factors affecting the Company's markets, operations, pricing, products, services and fees;

 the Company s ability to manage the risks and costs involved in the remediation efforts to the Bank's Home Mortgage Disclosure Act HMDA compliance and reporting, and the impact of enforcement actions or legal proceedings with respect to the Bank s HMDA program; 
 the success of the Company at managing the risks involved in the foregoing and managing its business; and 
 the timing and occurrence or non-occurrence of events that may be subject to circumstances beyond the Company's control. 
 
 For the reasons described above, we caution you against relying on any forward-looking statements. You should not consider any list of such factors to be an exhaustive statement of all of the risks, uncertainties, or potentially inaccurate assumptions that could cause our current expectations or beliefs to change.

Lending Programs and Policies. The Bank's lending activities include commercial and consumer loans, including the following loan categories. 
 Multi-family residential loans . Multi-family residential (five or more dwelling units) loans generally are secured by multi-family rental properties, such as apartment buildings. In underwriting multi-family residential loans, the Bank considers a number of factors, which include the projected net cash flow to the loan's debt service requirement, the age and condition of the collateral, the financial resources and income level of the borrower and the borrower's experience in owning or managing similar properties. Multi-family residential loans are originated in amounts up to 80 of the appraised value of the property securing the loan. 
 Loans secured by multi-family residential real estate generally involve different credit risk than single-family residential loans and carry larger loan balances. This different credit risk is a result of several factors, including the concentration of principal in a limited number of loans and borrowers, the effects of general economic and societal conditions on income-producing properties, the primary source of cash flow for repayment being spread across multiple tenants, the effects of government orders such as eviction forbearance and the increased difficulty of evaluating and monitoring these types of loans. Repayment of loans secured by multi-family mortgages typically depends upon the successful operation of the related real estate property. If the cash flow from the project is reduced, the borrower's ability to repay the loan may be impaired. The Bank seeks to minimize these risks through its underwriting policies, which require such loans to be qualified at origination on the basis of the property's income and debt service ratio. 
 It is the Bank's policy to obtain title insurance ensuring that it has a valid first lien on the mortgaged real estate serving as collateral for the loan. Borrowers must also obtain hazard insurance prior to closing and, when required by regulation, flood insurance. Borrowers may be required to advance funds on a monthly basis, together with each payment of principal and interest, to a mortgage escrow account from which the Bank makes disbursements for items such as real estate taxes, hazard insurance premiums and private mortgage insurance premiums when due. 
 Commercial and industrial loans . The Bank makes various types of business loans to customers in its market area for working capital, acquiring real estate, equipment or other business purposes, such as acquisitions. The terms of these loans generally range from less than one year to a maximum of ten years. The loans are either negotiated on a fixed-rate basis or carry adjustable interest rates indexed to the LIBOR rate, prime rate or another market rate. In most cases, these loan agreements include language that will provide for a replacement for LIBOR as the index rate. 
 
 Commercial loans are made based upon assessment of the borrower's ability and willingness to repay along with an evaluation of secondary repayment sources such as the value and marketability of collateral. Most such loans are extended to closely held businesses and the personal guaranty of the principals is usually obtained. Commercial loans have a relatively high risk of default compared to residential real estate loans. Pricing of commercial loans is based on the credit risk of the borrower with consideration given to the overall relationship of the borrower, including deposits and contributed equity/loan-to-value ratio. The acquisition of business deposits is an important focus of this business line. The Bank provides a full line of treasury management products to support the depository needs of its clients. 
 
 The Company also participated in the Small Business Administration s Paycheck Protection Program and made various business loans pursuant to this. 
 Construction loans . The Bank originates construction loans to finance construction of single-family and multi-family residences as well as commercial properties. Loans made to builders are generally tied to an interest rate index and normally have maturities of two years or less or are structured such that they convert to a permanent loan after the completion of construction or stabilization of the property. Loans made to individuals for construction of their home generally are 30 year fixed rate loans. The Bank's policies provide that for residential construction loans, loans may be made for 85 or less of the appraised value of the property upon completion. As a result of activity over the past four decades, the Bank believes that builders of single-family residences in its primary market areas consider the Bank to be a construction lender of choice. Because of this history, the Bank has developed a staff with in-depth land development and construction experience and working relationships with selected builders based on their operating histories and financial stability. 
 Construction lending involves a higher level of risk than single-family residential lending due to the concentration of principal in a limited number of loans and borrowers and the effects of general economic conditions in the home building industry. Moreover, a construction loan can involve additional risks because of the complexities of completing the construction, the inherent difficulty in estimating both the estimated cost (including interest) of the project and the property's value at completion of the project. 
 Land development loans . The Bank's land development loans are of a short-term nature and are generally made for 75 or less of the appraised value of the unimproved property. Funds are disbursed periodically at various stages of completion as authorized by the Company's personnel. The interest rate on these loans typically adjust daily or monthly in accordance with a designated index. 
 
 7 

Land development loans involve a higher degree of credit risk than long-term financing on owner-occupied real estate. Mitigation of risk of loss on a land development loan is dependent largely upon the accuracy of the initial estimate of the property's value at completion of development compared to the estimated cost (including interest) of development and the financial strength of the borrower. 
 Permanent land loans . The Bank's permanent land loans (also called consumer lot loans) are generally made on improved land, with the intent of building a primary or secondary residence. These loans are limited to 70 or less of the appraised value of the property, up to a maximum loan amount of 700,000. The interest rate on permanent land loans is generally fixed for 20 years. 
 Single-family residential loans . The Bank originates 30 year fixed-rate mortgage loans secured by single-family residences. Moreover, it is the Bank's general policy to include in the documentation evidencing its conventional mortgage loans a due-on-sale clause, which facilitates adjustment of interest rates on such loans when the property securing the loan is sold or transferred. 
 All of the Bank's mortgage lending is subject to written, nondiscriminatory underwriting standards, loan origination procedures and lending policies approved by the Company's Board of Directors (the "Board"). Property valuations are required on all real estate loans. Appraisals are prepared by independent appraisers, reviewed by staff of the Bank, and approved by the Bank's management. Property evaluations are sometimes utilized in lieu of appraisals on single-family real estate loans of 250,000 or less and are reviewed by the Bank's staff. Detailed loan applications are obtained to determine the borrower's ability to repay and the more significant items on these applications are verified through the use of credit reports, financial statements or written confirmations. 
 Depending on the size of the loan involved, a varying number of officers of the Bank must approve the loan application before the loan can be granted. Federal guidelines limit the amount of a real estate loan made to a specified percentage of the value of the property securing the loan, as determined by an evaluation at the time the loan is originated. This is referred to as the loan-to-value ratio. The Board sets the maximum loan-to-value ratios for each type of real estate loan offered by the Bank. 
 When establishing general reserves for loans with loan-to-value ratios exceeding 80 that are not insured by private mortgage insurance, the Bank considers the additional risk inherent in these products, as well as their relative loan loss experience, and provides reserves when deemed appropriate. The total balance for loans with loan-to-value ratios exceeding 80 at origination as of September 30, 2021, was 206,411,000, with allocated reserves of 4,422,000. 
 Consumer loans . The Bank's non-mortgage consumer loan portfolio consists of prime quality student loans acquired from an independent financial investment firm that retains 1 of each loan, plus various other non-mortgage consumer loans including personal lines of credit and credit cards. 
 
 Home equity loans . The Bank extends revolving lines of credit to consumers that are secured by a first or second mortgage on a single family residence. The interest rate on these loans adjusts monthly indexed to prime. Total loan-to-value ratios when combined with any underlying first liens held by the Bank are limited to 85 or less. Total loan-to-value ratios are limited to 80 or less when underlying first liens are held by any other investor. Loan terms are a ten year draw period followed by a fifteen year amortization period. 
 Origination and Purchase of Loans. The Bank has general authority to lend anywhere in the United States; however, its primary lending areas are within the states of Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Arizona, Utah, Nevada, New Mexico and Texas. Loan originations come from a variety of sources. Residential loan originations result from referrals from real estate brokers, walk-in customers, purchasers of property in connection with builder projects that are financed by the Bank, mortgage brokers and refinance activity for existing customers. Business purpose loans are obtained primarily by direct solicitation of borrowers and ongoing relationships. 
 
 The Bank also purchases loans and mortgage-backed securities when lending rates and mortgage volume for new loan originations in its market area do not fulfill its needs.

 Interest Rates, Loan Fees and Service Charges. Interest rates charged by the Bank on mortgage loans are primarily determined by the competitive loan rates offered in its lending areas and in the secondary market. Mortgage loan rates reflect factors such as general interest rates, the supply of money available to the industry and the demand for such loans. General economic conditions, the regulatory programs and policies of federal and state agencies, including the Federal Reserve Bank s monetary policies, changes in tax laws and governmental budgetary programs influence these factors. 
 The Bank receives fees for originating loans in addition to various fees and charges related to existing loans, including prepayment charges, late charges and assumption fees. In making one-to-four- family home mortgage loans, the Bank normally charges an origination fee and as part of the loan application, the borrower pays the Bank for out-of-pocket costs, such as the appraisal fee, whether or not the borrower closes the loan. The interest rate charged is normally the prevailing rate at the time the loan application is approved and accepted. In the case of construction loans, the Bank normally charges an origination fee. Loan origination fees and other terms of multi-family residential loans are individually negotiated.

Investment Activities 
 As a national association, the Bank is obligated to maintain adequate liquidity and does so by holding cash and cash equivalents and by investing in securities. These investments may include, among other things, certain certificates of deposit, repurchase agreements, bankers acceptances, loans to financial institutions whose deposits are federally-insured, federal funds, United States government and agency obligations and mortgage-backed securities. 
 
 Sources of Funds 
 
 General. Deposits are the primary source of the Bank s funds for use in lending and other general business purposes. In addition to deposits, the Bank derives funds from loan repayments, advances from the FHLB, other borrowings, and from investment repayments and sales. Loan repayments are a relatively stable source of funds, while deposit inflows and outflows are influenced by general interest rates, money market conditions, the availability of FDIC insurance and the market perception of the Company s financial stability. Borrowings may be used on a short-term basis to compensate for reductions in normal sources of funds, such as deposit inflows at lower than projected levels. Borrowings may also be used on a longer-term basis to support expanded activities and to manage interest rate risk. Borrowing capacity and availability is influenced by interest rates, market conditions, availability of collateral and the market's perception of the Bank's financial stability. 
 
 Deposits. The Bank relies on a mix of deposit types, including business and personal checking accounts, term certificates of deposit, and other savings deposit alternatives that have no fixed term, such as money market accounts and passbook savings accounts. The Bank offers several consumer checking account products, both interest bearing and non-interest bearing and three business checking accounts, two of which target small businesses with relatively simple and straightforward banking needs and one for larger, more complex business depositors with an account that prices monthly based on the volume and type of activity. Savings and money market accounts are offered to both businesses and consumers, with interest paid after certain threshold amounts are exceeded. 
 
 The Bank s deposits are obtained primarily from residents of Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Arizona, Utah, Nevada, New Mexico and Texas. The Bank does not advertise for deposits outside of these states. 
 
 Borrowings. The Bank has a credit line with the Federal Home Loan Bank of Des Moines ("FHLB") for up to 45 of total assets, subject to availability of collateral. The Bank obtains advances from the FHLB upon the security of the FHLB capital stock it owns and certain of its loans, provided certain standards related to credit worthiness have been met. Such advances are made pursuant to several different credit programs. Each credit program has its own interest rate and range of maturities, and the FHLB prescribes acceptable uses to which the advances pursuant to each program may be put, as well as limitations on the size of such advances. Depending on the program, such limitations are based either on a fixed percentage of assets or the Company's credit worthiness. FHLB advances have, from time to time, been available to meet seasonal and other withdrawals of savings accounts and to expand the Bank's lending program. 
 The Bank may need to borrow funds for short periods of time to meet day-to-day financing needs. In these instances, funds are borrowed from other financial institutions or the Federal Reserve, for periods generally ranging from one to seven days at the then current borrowing rate. At September 30, 2021, the Bank had no such short-term borrowings. 
 For further information on these activities, see Note L to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.

12 

Additional information will be provided in the Company s forthcoming Community and Social Responsibility Report which will be made available on the Company s website. Nothing on our website, including the aforementioned report, shall be deemed incorporated by reference into this Annual Report. 
 The Company 
 
 General. The Company is registered as a bank holding company and is subject to regulation, examination, supervision and reporting requirements of the Federal Reserve. 
 Regulation. The Company operates in a highly regulated industry. The regulatory structure governing the Company s operations is designed primarily for the protection of the deposit insurance funds and consumers, and not to benefit our shareholders. As part of this regulatory structure, the Company is subject to policies and other guidance developed by the regulatory agencies with respect to capital levels, the timing and amount of dividend payments, the classification of assets and the establishment of adequate loan loss reserves for regulatory purposes. Under this structure, regulators have broad discretion to impose restrictions and limitations on the Company s operations if they determine, among other things, that such operations are unsafe or unsound, fail to comply with applicable law or are otherwise inconsistent with laws and regulations or with the supervisory policies of these agencies. 
 
 Failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations can result in a range of sanctions and enforcement actions, including the imposition of civil money penalties, formal agreements and cease and desist orders. In order to comply with regulatory requirements, the Bank has and will continue to incur additional significant costs in order to bring programs and operations into compliance. 
 
 For further information on regulatory matters, see Note A to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data as well as the "Risk Factors" section of this report and the "USA Patriot Act of 2001" discussion below. 
 
 Sections below include a description of certain laws and regulations that relate to the regulation of the Company and the Bank. The description of these laws and regulations, and descriptions of laws and regulations contained elsewhere herein, do not purport to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to applicable laws and regulations. 
 
 Restrictions on Activities and Acquisitions. Bank holding companies are subject to a variety of restrictions on their activities and the acquisitions they can make. Generally, the activities or acquisition of a bank holding company that is not a financial holding company are limited to those that constitute banking or managing or controlling banks or which are closely related to banking. In addition, without the prior approval of the Federal Reserve, bank holding companies are generally prohibited from acquiring more than 5 of the outstanding shares of any class of voting securities of a bank or bank holding company, taking any action that causes a bank to become a subsidiary of the bank holding company, acquiring all or substantially all of the assets of a bank, or merging with another bank holding company. 
 
 Control of Company or Bank. Pursuant to the Change in Bank Control Act, (the CIBC Act individuals, corporations or other entities acquiring Company equity interests may, alone or together with other investors, be deemed to control a holding company or a bank. If an acquisition is deemed to constitute control of the holding company or bank and is not subject to approval under the Bank Holding Company Act or certain other statutes, such person or group will be required to file a notice under the CIBC Act. Generally, ownership of, or power to vote, more than 25 of any class of voting securities constitutes control. In the case of a bank or bank holding company the securities of which are registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"), ownership of or power to vote more than 10 of any class of voting securities creates a presumption of control. 
 
 Source of Strength. Under long-standing Federal Reserve policy, a bank holding company is expected to serve as a source of financial and management strength to its subsidiary bank. Under this policy, a bank holding company is expected to stand ready to provide adequate capital funds to its subsidiary bank during periods of financial adversity and to maintain financial flexibility and capital raising capacity to assist its subsidiary bank. The Dodd-Frank Act codified the source of strength doctrine by adopting a statutory provision requiring, among other things, that bank holding companies serve as a source of financial strength to their subsidiary banks. 
 
 Restrictions on Company Dividends. The Company s ability to pay dividends to its shareholders is affected by several factors. Since the Company is a separate legal entity from the Bank and its subsidiaries and does not have significant 
 
 13 

operations of its own, the Company may not be able to pay dividends to its shareholders if the Bank is unable to pay dividends to the Company. The Bank s ability to pay dividends is subject to various regulatory restrictions. 
 
 In addition, the Company s ability to pay dividends is subject to rules and policies of the Federal Reserve. It is the policy of the Federal Reserve that bank holding companies should pay cash dividends only out of income available over the past year and only if prospective earnings retention is consistent with the company s expected future needs and financial condition. Capital rules adopted by the Federal Reserve, effective January 2015, may limit the Company s ability to pay dividends if the Company fails to meet certain requirements under the rules. In addition, if we do not or are unable to pay quarterly dividends on our Series A Preferred Stock, we may not pay a dividend to the holders of our common stock. 
 
 See Washington Federal Bank, National Association, wholly-owned subsidiary ("Bank" or "WaFd Bank") - Restrictions on Dividends. 
 
 Since the Company is a Washington state corporation, it is also subject to restrictions under Washington corporate law relating to dividends. Generally, under Washington law, a corporation may not pay a dividend if, after giving effect to the dividend, the corporation would be unable to pay its liabilities as they become due in the ordinary course of business or the corporation s total assets would be less than the sum of its total liabilities plus (with some exceptions) the amount that would be needed, if the corporation were to be dissolved at the time of the dividend payment, to satisfy the dissolution preferences of senior equity securities. 

Washington Federal Bank, National Association, wholly-owned operating subsidiary ("Bank" or "WaFd Bank") 
 
 General. The Bank is a federally-chartered national bank and certain deposits of the bank are federally insured and backed by the full faith and credit of the United States government. Accordingly, the Bank is subject to broad federal regulation and oversight by its primary regulator, the OCC, extending to all aspects of its operations. The Bank is a member of the FDIC and its deposits are insured up to applicable limits of the Depository Insurance Fund DIF ), which is administered by the FDIC. As a result, the FDIC has certain regulatory and examination authority over the Bank. 
 
 As a national bank, the Bank is required to be a member of the Federal Reserve. As a member, it is required to purchase and maintain stock in the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco FRBSF in an amount equal to 3.00 of the paid-up capital stock and surplus of the Bank and have available another 3.00 in reserves. At September 30, 2021, the Bank had 23,990,000 in FRBSF stock, which was in compliance with this requirement. 
 
 Federal Institution Regulations. The Company is a bank holding company registered with the Federal Reserve. The OCC has extensive authority over the operations of national banks. As part of this authority, national banks are required to file periodic reports with the OCC and are subject to periodic examinations by the OCC. Federal laws and regulations prescribe the investment and lending authority of the Bank, and the Bank is prohibited from engaging in any activities not permitted by such laws and regulations. While the Bank has broad authority to engage in all types of lending activities, a variety of restrictions apply to certain other investments by the Bank. 
 
 Interstate Banking . Subject to certain limitations and restrictions, a bank holding company, with prior approval of the Federal Reserve, may acquire an out-of-state bank; banks in states that do not prohibit out-of-state mergers may merge with the approval of the appropriate federal banking agency, and a bank may establish a de novo branch out of state if such branching is permitted by the other state for state banks chartered by such other state. 
 
 Insurance of Deposit Accounts. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, the maximum amount of federal deposit insurance coverage was permanently increased from 100,000 to 250,000 per depositor, per institution. Due to the significant number of bank failures and the current balance of the DIF, the Company anticipates continued elevated FDIC premiums for the industry going forward. The Dodd-Frank Act also broadened the base for FDIC insurance assessments. Assessments are now based on the average consolidated total assets less tangible equity capital of a financial institution. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act raised the minimum designated reserve ratio, which the FDIC is required to set each year for the DIF, to 1.35 . The Dodd-Frank Act eliminated the requirement that the FDIC pay dividends to depository institutions when the reserve ratio exceeds certain thresholds. The FDIC has established a higher reserve ratio of 2 as a long-term goal beyond what is required by statute. 
 
 Brokered Deposits. The Federal Deposit Insurance Act prohibits an insured depository institution from accepting brokered deposits or offering interest rates on any deposits significantly higher than the prevailing rate in the bank s normal market area or nationally (depending upon where the deposits are solicited), unless it is well-capitalized or is adequately capitalized and receives a waiver from the FDIC. A depository institution that is adequately capitalized and accepts brokered deposits under a 
 
 14 

waiver from the FDIC may not pay an interest rate on any deposit in excess of 75 basis points over certain prevailing market rates. 
 
 On December 15, 2020, the FDIC issued a final rule intended to modernize its brokered deposit regulations in light of modern deposit-taking methods. The final rule establishes a new framework for certain provisions of the deposit broker definition and amends the FDIC s interest rate methodology for calculating the national rate, the national rate cap, and the local market rate cap. The final rule became effective on April 1, 2021 with an extended compliance date of January 1, 2022. 
 
 Transactions with Affiliates; Insider Loans. Under current federal law, all transactions between and among a national bank and its affiliates, including holding companies, are subject to Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and Regulation W promulgated thereunder. Generally, these requirements limit extensions of credit and certain other such transactions by the bank to affiliates to a percentage of the institution's capital and generally such transactions must be collateralized. Generally, all affiliate transactions must be on terms at least as favorable to the bank as transactions with non-affiliates. In addition, a bank may not lend to any affiliate engaged in non-banking activities that are not permissible for a bank holding company or acquire shares of any affiliate that is not a subsidiary. The OCC is authorized to impose additional restrictions on transactions with affiliates if necessary to protect the safety and soundness of a national bank. 
 
 Extensions of credit by a national bank to executive officers, directors and principal shareholders are subject to Section 22(h) of the Federal Reserve Act, which, among other things, generally prohibits loans to any such individual where the aggregate amount exceeds an amount equal to 15 of an institution's unimpaired capital and surplus plus an additional 10 of unimpaired capital and surplus in the case of loans that are fully secured by readily marketable collateral. Section 22(h) permits loans to directors, executive officers and principal shareholders made pursuant to a benefit or compensation program that is widely available to employees of a subject bank provided that no preference is given to any officer, director or principal shareholder, or related interest thereto, over any other employee. In addition, the aggregate amount of extensions of credit by a bank to all insiders cannot exceed the institution's unimpaired capital and surplus. Furthermore, Section 22(g) places additional restrictions on loans to executive officers. 
 
 Effective on July 21, 2012, the affiliate transaction rules in Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act were expanded to broaden the definition of affiliate and to apply these rules to securities lending, repurchase agreements and derivatives. These revisions also strengthened collateral requirements and limited Federal Reserve exemptive authority. Further, the definition of extension of credit for transactions with executive officers, directors and principal shareholders was expanded to include credit exposure arising from a derivative transaction, a repurchase or reverse repurchase agreement or a securities lending or borrowing transaction. These provisions have not had a material effect on the Company or the Bank. 
 
 Restrictions on Dividends. OCC regulations govern dividends by a national bank. A national bank must file an application for approval of a dividend if: 
 
 the total dividends for the applicable calendar year exceed the sum of the institution's net income for that year to date plus the institution's retained net income for the preceding two years; 
 the institution would not be at least adequately capitalized following the dividend; 
 the dividend would violate any applicable statute, regulation, agreement or OCC imposed condition; or 
 the dividend is paid in property other than cash or stock of the bank. 

Other capital distributions, such as stock repurchases, generally require the approval of the OCC. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements may place certain restrictions on the payment of dividends and stock repurchases. 
 
 Federal Home Loan Bank System. The Bank is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank ("FHLB") of Des Moines, which is one of 11 regional FHLBs that provide funding to their members for making home mortgage loans, as well as loans for affordable housing and community development. Each FHLB serves members within its assigned region and is funded primarily through proceeds derived from the sale of consolidated obligations of the FHLB system. Loans are made to members in accordance with the policies and procedures established by the Board of Directors of the FHLB. At September 30, 2021, FHLB advances to the Company amounted to 1,720,000,000. As a member, the Bank is required to purchase and maintain stock in the FHLB of Des Moines. At September 30, 2021, the Company held 78,873,000 in FHLB of Des Moines stock, which was in compliance with this requirement. 
 
 Community Reinvestment Act and Fair Lending Laws. National banks have a responsibility under the Community Reinvestment Act ("CRA") and related regulations of the OCC to help meet the credit needs of their communities, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods. In addition, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act (together, 
 
 15 

the "Fair Lending Laws") prohibit lenders from discriminating in their lending practices on the basis of characteristics specified in those statutes. An institution's failure to comply with the provisions of the CRA could, at a minimum, result in regulatory restrictions on its activities. Failure to comply with the Fair Lending Laws could result in enforcement actions by the OCC, the CFPB and other federal regulatory agencies, including the U.S. Department of Justice. 
 
 USA Patriot Act of 2001. The USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 ("Patriot Act"), through amendments to the federal Bank Secrecy Act BSA ), substantially broadened the scope of United States anti money-laundering laws and regulations by imposing significant new compliance and due diligence obligations, creating new crimes and penalties and expanding the extra-territorial scope of United States jurisdiction. The United States Treasury Department has issued a number of regulations under the Patriot Act that apply to financial institutions such as the Bank. These regulations impose obligations on financial institutions to maintain appropriate policies, procedures and controls to detect, prevent and report money laundering and terrorist financing and to verify the identity of their customers. Failure of a financial institution to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering and terrorist financing, or to comply satisfactorily with all relevant Patriot Act and BSA requirements, could have serious legal and reputational consequences for the institution. 
 
 On February 28, 2018, pursuant to a Stipulation and Consent to the Issuance of a Consent Order (the Consent Order ), the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency issued a Consent Order relating to the Bank, the terms of which are intended to further enhance its BSA program. 
 
 The Consent Order requires, among other things, that the Bank: (1) maintain a Compliance Committee of at least three directors; (2) employ a permanent, qualified, and experienced BSA Officer and be provided sufficient staffing and oversight resources; (3) review, update and implement an ongoing BSA risk assessment; (4) ensure adherence to a written program of policies and procedures to provide compliance with the BSA; (5) develop and implement a written program of policies and procedures to ensure timely and appropriate review of transaction activity, disposition of alerts, and timely filing of SARs; (6) develop and implement a written program of policies and procedures to provide for implementation of an automated suspicious activity monitoring system, including appropriate model governance; (7) engage an independent consultant to review account and transaction activity Look-Back (8) review and update risk-based processes to obtain and analyze appropriate customer due diligence information at the time of account opening and on an ongoing basis; (9) complete independent testing; (10) develop and implement a comprehensive, ongoing BSA and OFAC training program; and (11) submit certain reports to the OCC. 
 
 On September 30, 2021, the Bank announced that it had entered into an agreement with the OCC to pay a 2,500,000 civil money penalty associated with the deficiencies identified in the Stipulation and Consent Order which remains in place. 
 
 Copies of the Stipulation and the Consent Order were filed with the SEC on March 1, 2018 as exhibits to the Company s Current Report on Form 8-K. A copy of the consent order for the civil money penalty was filed with the SEC on October 1, 2021 as an exhibit to the Company s Current Report on Form 8-K. See Item 1A. Risk Factors for additional details. 

Regulatory Capital Requirements. Bank holding companies and federally insured banks are required to maintain minimum levels of regulatory capital. The Federal Reserve establishes capital standards applicable to all bank holding companies, and the OCC establishes capital standards applicable to all national banks. The Federal Reserve and the OCC implemented new capital rules, effective January 1, 2015, that substantially amended the existing capital rules for bank holding companies and banks. These new rules reflect, in part, certain standards initially adopted by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision in December 2010 (which standards are commonly referred to as Basel III as well as requirements contemplated by the Dodd-Frank Act. 
 
 The rules require a new capital ratio of common equity Tier 1 capital to risk based assets. Common equity Tier 1 capital generally consists of retained earnings and common stock instruments (subject to certain adjustments) as well as accumulated other comprehensive income AOCI except to the extent that the Company and the Bank exercise a one-time irrevocable option to exclude certain components of AOCI, which the Company and the Bank have done. Tier 1 capital also includes non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock and limited amounts of minority interests. Regulatory deductions from capital include goodwill and intangible assets. The new rules modify the manner in which certain capital elements are determined, including but not limited to, requiring certain deductions related to mortgage servicing rights and deferred tax assets. Total capital consists of Tier 1 capital and supplementary capital. Supplementary capital consists of certain capital instruments that do not qualify as core capital as well as general valuation loan and lease loss allowances up to a maximum of 1.25 of risk-weighted assets. Supplementary capital may be used to satisfy the risk-based requirement only in an amount equal to the amount of Tier 1 capital. 

16 

In determining the required amount of risk-based capital, total assets, including certain off-balance-sheet items, are multiplied by a risk-weight factor based on the risks inherent in the type of assets held by an institution. The risk categories range from 0 for low-risk assets such as U.S. Treasury securities and GNMA securities to 1,250 for various types of loans and other assets deemed to be of higher risk. Single-family residential loans having loan-to-value ratios not exceeding 80 and meeting certain additional criteria, as well as certain multi-family residential loans, qualify for a 50 risk-weight treatment. The book value of each asset is multiplied by the risk factor applicable to the asset category, and the sum of the products of this calculation equals total risk-weighted assets. The rules make changes in the methods of calculating certain risk-based assets, which in turn affects the calculation of risk-based ratios. Higher or more sensitive risk weights are assigned to various categories of assets, among which are commercial real estate, credit facilities that finance the acquisition, development or construction of real property, certain exposures or credit that are 90 days past due or are nonaccrual, foreign exposures, certain corporate exposures, securitization exposures, equity exposures and in certain cases mortgage servicing rights and deferred tax assets. 
 
 Both the Company and the Bank are required to have a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 4.5 . In addition, both the Company and the Bank are required to have a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4.0 , a Tier 1 risk-based ratio of 6.0 and a total risk-based ratio of 8.0 . Both the Company and the Bank are required to establish a conservation buffer, consisting of common equity Tier 1 capital, equal to 2.5 . The capital conservation buffer is designed to ensure that banks build up capital buffers outside periods of stress, which can be drawn down as losses are incurred. An institution that does not meet the conservation buffer will be subject to restrictions on certain activities including payment of dividends, stock repurchases and discretionary bonuses to executive officers. 
 
 The Federal Reserve and the OCC are also authorized to impose capital requirements in excess of these standards on individual institutions on a case-by-case basis. Management believes that the current capital levels of the Company and the Bank are sufficient to be in compliance with the fully phased-in standards under the rules. 
 
 Any bank holding company or national bank that fails the capital requirements is subject to possible enforcement actions. Such actions could include a capital directive, a cease and desist or consent order, civil money penalties, restrictions on an institution's operations and/or the appointment of a conservator or receiver. Federal Reserve and OCC capital regulations provide that such supervisory actions, through enforcement proceedings or otherwise, could require one or more of a variety of corrective actions. 
 
 For information regarding compliance with each of these capital requirements by the Company and the Bank as of September 30, 2021, see Note Q to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 hereof. 
 
 Prompt Corrective Action. Federal statutes establish a supervisory framework based on five capital categories: well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized. An institution s category depends upon its capital levels in relation to relevant capital measures, which include a risk-based capital measure, a leverage ratio capital measure and certain other factors. The federal banking agencies have adopted regulations that implement this statutory framework. 
 
 The prompt corrective action rules, which apply to the Bank but not the Company, are modified to include a common equity Tier 1 risk-based ratio and to increase certain other capital requirements for the various thresholds. For example, the requirements for the Bank to be considered well-capitalized under the rules are a 5.0 Tier 1 leverage ratio, a 6.5 common equity Tier 1 risk-based ratio, an 8.0 Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio and a 10.0 total risk-based capital ratio. To be adequately capitalized, those ratios are 4.0 , 4.5 . 6.0 and 8.0 , respectively. 
 
 An institution that is not well capitalized is subject to certain restrictions on brokered deposits, including restrictions on the rates it can offer on its deposits, generally. Any institution that is neither well capitalized nor adequately capitalized is considered undercapitalized. Federal law authorizes the OCC to reclassify a well capitalized institution as adequately capitalized and may require an adequately capitalized institution or an undercapitalized institution to comply with supervisory actions as if it were in the next lower category. The OCC may not reclassify a significantly undercapitalized institution as critically undercapitalized. As of September 30, 2021, the Bank exceeded the requirements of a well capitalized institution. 
 
 Dodd-Frank Act Stress Tests ("DFAST"). On July 6, 2018, bank regulatory agencies (the Federal Reserve, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency) issued a joint interagency statement regarding the impact of the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act ("EGRRCPA") on financial institutions. The EGRRCPA gave immediate relief from stress testing for applicable bank holding companies but not financial institutions until November 25, 2019. Pursuant to direction from the Bank's regulators, the Bank was provided similar relief and is no longer required to submit company-run annual stress tests. Notwithstanding these amendments to the stress testing requirements, the 
 
 17 

federal banking agencies indicated through interagency guidance that the capital planning and risk management practices of institutions with total assets less than 100 billion would continue to be reviewed through the regular supervisory process. Although the Bank will continue to monitor its capital consistent with the safety and soundness expectations of the federal regulators, the Bank will no longer conduct company-run stress testing as a result of the legislative and regulatory amendments. The Bank continues to use customized stress testing to support the business and as part of its risk management and capital planning process. 
 
 EGRRCPA also enacted several important changes in some technical compliance areas that we believe will help reduce our regulatory burden, including: 
 
 Prohibiting federal banking regulators from imposing higher capital standards on High Volatility Commercial Real Estate HVCRE exposures unless they are for acquisition, development or construction ADC ), and clarifying ADC status; 
 Requiring the federal banking agencies to amend the Liquidity Coverage Ratio Rule such that all qualifying investment-grade, liquid and readily-marketable municipal securities are treated as level 2B liquid assets, making them more attractive investment alternatives; 
 Exempting from appraisal requirements certain transactions involving real property in rural areas and valued at less than 400,000; and 
 Directing the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to provide guidance on the applicability of the TILA-RESPA Integrated Disclosure rule to mortgage assumption transactions and construction-to-permanent home loans, as well the extent to which lenders can rely on model disclosures that do not reflect recent regulatory changes. 
 
 Despite the improvements for mid-size financial institutions such as the Company that has resulted from EGRRCPA, many provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act and its implementing regulations remain in place and will continue to result in additional operating and compliance costs that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operation. In addition, the EGRRCPA requires the enactment of a number of implementing regulations, the details of which may have a material effect on the ultimate impact of the law. 
 
 Cybersecurity. The federal banking agencies have established certain expectations with respect to an institution's information security and cybersecurity programs, with an increasing focus on risk management, processes related to information technology and operational resiliency, and the use of third-parties in the provision of financial services. In October 2016, the federal banking agencies jointly issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking on enhanced cybersecurity risk management 
 and resilience standards that would address five categories of cyber standards which include (i) cyber risk governance, (ii) cyber risk management, (iii) internal dependency management, (iv) external dependency management, and (v) incident response, cyber resilience, and situational awareness. As proposed, these enhanced standards would apply only to depository institutions and depository institution holding companies with total consolidated assets of 50 billion or more; however, it is possible that if these enhanced standards are implemented, even if the 50 billion threshold is increased, the OCC will consider them in connection with the examination and supervision of banks below the 50 billion threshold. The federal banking agencies have not yet taken further action on these proposed standards. 
 
 State regulators have also been increasingly active in implementing privacy and cybersecurity standards and regulations. Recently, several states have adopted regulations requiring certain financial institutions to implement cybersecurity programs and providing detailed requirements with respect to these programs, including data encryption requirements. Many states have also recently implemented or modified their data breach notification and data privacy requirements. We expect this trend of state-level activity in those areas to continue, and are continually monitoring developments in the states in which the Company operates. 
 
 In February 2018, the SEC published interpretive guidance to assist public companies in preparing disclosures about cybersecurity risks and incidents. These SEC guidelines, and any other regulatory guidance, are in addition to notification and disclosure requirements under state and federal banking law and regulations. 
 
 In December 2020, the U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies released a proposed rule regarding notification requirements for banking organizations related to significant computer security incidents. Under the proposal, a bank holding company, such as the Company, and an OCC-supervised insured depository institution, such as the Bank, would be required to notify the Federal Reserve or OCC, respectively, within 36 hours of incidents that could result in the banking organization s inability to deliver services to a material portion of its customer base, jeopardize the viability of key operations of the banking organization, or impact the stability of the financial sector. The effects on the Company and the Bank will depend on the final form of the rule and how it is implemented.

Taxation 
 
 In addition to federal income tax, the Company is also subject to income, franchise, excise or gross receipts tax in states (and some cities) where the Company has branches or is deemed to have sufficient nexus for tax purposes. The Company generally files consolidated federal and state income tax returns with its subsidiaries. 
 
 The Company's federal income tax returns are open and subject to potential examination by the IRS for fiscal year 2018 and later. 

Competition 
 
 We operate in a highly competitive environment. Our competitors include other national banks, savings associations, community banks, credit unions and other financial intermediaries, and new market participants offering services similar to those that we offer. We compete with some competitors within our geographic market area, and with others on a product specific basis, such as the residential mortgage market. Our ability to compete effectively depends on our ability to provide first-rate, friendly and professional customer service and deliver the banking solutions that our customers want and need. We are also dependent upon our ability to attract and retain employees while managing compensation and other costs.

Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 
 Ownership of our common stock involves risk. Investors should carefully consider, in addition to the other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the following risk factors. The risks described below may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. These risks are not the only risks we face; additional risks and uncertainties not currently known or that are currently considered to be immaterial may also materially and adversely affect our business. 
 
 Operational Risks 
 
 Our allowance for credit losses ("ACL") may not be adequate to cover future loan losses, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 Due to the declining economic conditions, our customers may not be able to repay their loans according to the original terms, and the collateral securing the payment of those loans may be insufficient to pay any remaining loan balance. While we maintain, and have increased, our ACL to provide for loan defaults and non-performance, losses may exceed the value of the collateral securing the loans and the allowance may not fully cover any excess loss. 
 
 We make various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of our loan portfolio, including the creditworthiness of our borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of loans. Our ACL is based on these judgments, as well as historical loss experience and an evaluation of the other risks associated with our loan portfolio, including but not limited to, economic trends and conditions, changes in underwriting standards, management, competition, and trends in delinquencies, non-accrual and adversely classified loans. the size and composition of the loan portfolio, current economic conditions and geographic concentrations within the portfolio. We have also included assumptions about the severity and duration of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on our borrowers, their industry, and on economic conditions in general, all of which are highly uncertain and for which we have no historical experience to draw upon. Federal regulatory agencies, as part of their examination process, review our loans and ACL. If our assumptions and judgments used to determine the ACL prove to be incorrect, if the value of the collateral securing the loans decreases substantially or if regulators disagree with its judgments, we may need to increase the ACL in amounts that exceed our expectations. Material additions to the ACL would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. 
 
 We are exposed to risks related to our operational, technological, and third-party provided technology infrastructure. 
 
 We rely extensively on the successful and uninterrupted functioning of information technology and telecommunications systems to conduct our business. This includes internally developed systems, internally managed systems, outsourced systems provided by third-party service providers, internet facing digital products and services, mobile technologies and the on-going operational maintenance of each service. Any disruptions, failures, or inaccuracies of these systems, including changes and improvements, could result in our inability to service customers, manage operations, manage risk, meet regulatory obligations, or provide timely and accurate financial reporting which could damage our reputation, result in loss of customer business, subject us to regulatory scrutiny, or expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability. 
 
 In many instances, the Company s products and services to customers are dependent upon third-party service providers, who provide necessary, or critical, services and support. Any disruption of such services, or an unplanned termination of a third-party license or service agreement related thereto, could adversely affect our ability to provide necessary products and services for our customers. 
 
 In recent years, we have made a significant ongoing investment to enhance our technological capabilities with the objectives of enhancing customer experience, growing revenue, and improving operating efficiency. There is a risk that these investments may not provide the anticipated benefits and/or will prove significantly more costly and time consuming to produce. If this occurs, we may see a loss of customers, and our financial results and ability to execute on our strategic plan may be adversely impacted. 
 
 We are exposed to risks related to fraud and cyber-attacks. 
 
 The Company is continuously enhancing and expanding our digital products and services to meet customer and business needs with desired outcomes. These digital products and services often include storing, transmitting, and processing confidential customer, employee, monetary, and business information. Due to the nature of this information, and the value it has for internal and external threat actors, we, and our third-party service providers, continue to be subject to cyber-attacks and fraud activity that attempts to gain unauthorized access, misuse information and information systems, steal information, disrupt or degrade information systems, spread malicious software, and other illegal activities. 
 
 The Company has recently changed our consumer online and mobile banking platforms to provide more flexibility and customizable feature sets to improve customer experience. This change provides the Company more opportunity to differentiate 
 
 20 

ourselves in the market, but also increases our direct responsibility for managing cybersecurity risk associated with digital banking, when historically, the responsibility for providing adequate safeguards and security controls was managed by third party vendors. 
 
 We believe we have robust preventive, detective, and administrative safeguards and security controls to minimize the probability and magnitude of a material event. However, because the tactics and techniques used by threat actors to bypass safeguards and security controls change frequently, and often are not recognized until after an event has occurred, we may be unable to anticipate future tactics and techniques, or to implement adequate and timely protective measures. 
 
 Cybersecurity, and the continued development and enhancement of controls, processes, and practices designed to protect customer information, systems, computers, software, data, and networks from attack, damage, or unauthorized access remain a priority for the Company. As cybersecurity threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend additional resources to continue to enhance, modify, and refine our protective measures against these evolving threats. 
 
 To date, we have no knowledge of a successful cyber-attack or other material information security breach affecting our systems. However, our risk and exposure to these matters remains heightened because of, among other things, the evolving nature of these threats, the continuation of a remote work environment for our employees and service providers and our plans to continue to implement and expand digital banking services, expand operations, and use third-party information systems that includes cloud-based infrastructure, platforms, and software. Recent instances of attacks specifically targeting financial services businesses indicate that the risk to our systems remains significant. If we or a critical third party vendor were to experience a cyber-attack or information security breach, we could suffer damage to our reputation, productivity losses, response costs associated with investigation and resumption of services, and incur substantial additional expenses, including remediation expenses costs associated with customer notification and credit monitoring services, increased insurance premiums, regulatory penalties and fines, and costs associated civil litigation, any of which could have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 
 
 In addition, the Company s customers and vendors rely on technology and systems unmanaged by the Company, such as networking devices, server infrastructure, personal computers, smartphones, tablets, and other mobile devices, to contact and conduct business with the Company. If the devices of the Company s customers or vendors become the target of a cyber-attack, or information security breach, it could result in unauthorized access to, misuse of, or loss of confidential customer, employee, monetary, or business information. Threat actors using improperly obtained personal or financial information of consumers can attempt to obtain loans, lines of credit, or other financial products from the Company, or attempt to fraudulently persuade the Company s employees, customers, or other users of the Company s systems to disclose confidential information in order to gain improper access to the Company s information and information systems. 
 
 We also face additional costs when our customers become the victims of cyber-attacks. For example, various retailers have reported that they have been the victims of a cyber-attack in which large amounts of their customers data, including debit and credit card information, is obtained. Our customers may be the victims of phishing scams, providing cyber criminals access to their accounts, or credit or debit card information. In these situations, we incur costs to replace compromised cards and address fraudulent transaction activity affecting our customers. 
 
 Both internal and external fraud and theft are risks. If confidential customer, employee, monetary, or business information were to be mishandled or misused, we could suffer significant regulatory consequences, reputational damage, and financial loss. Such mishandling or misuse could include, for example, if such information were erroneously provided to parties who are not permitted to have the information, either by fault of our systems, employees, or counterparties, or if such information were to be intercepted or otherwise inappropriately taken by third parties, or if our own employees abused their access to financial systems to commit fraud against our customers and the Company. These activities can occur in connection with the origination of loans and lines of credit, ACH transactions, wire transactions, ATM transactions, and checking transactions, and result in financial losses as well as reputational damage. 
 
 Operational errors can include information system misconfiguration, clerical or record-keeping errors, or disruptions from faulty or disabled computer or telecommunications systems. Because the nature of the financial services business involves a high volume of transactions, certain errors may be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and successfully rectified. Because of the Company s large transaction volume and its necessary dependence upon automated systems to record and process these transactions, there is a risk that technical flaws, tampering, or manipulation of those automated systems, arising from events wholly or partially beyond its control, may give rise to disruption of service to customers and to financial loss or liability. We are exposed to the risk that our business continuity and data security systems prove to be inadequate. 
 
 The occurrence of any of these risks could result in a diminished ability for us to operate our business, additional costs to correct defects, potential liability to clients, reputational damage. and regulatory intervention, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is increasing cyber-security risks. 
 
 The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has introduced additional risk to our information systems and security procedures, controls and policies as a result of employees, contractors and other corporate partners working remotely. As a result of the increased remote workforce, we must increasingly rely on information technology systems that are outside our direct control, 
 
 21 

and these systems are also vulnerable to cyber-based attacks and security breaches. In addition, since the beginning of pandemic, there has been an increase in attacks by cyber criminals on businesses and individuals, utilizing interest in pandemic-related information and the fear and uncertainty caused by the pandemic to increase phishing, malware, and other cybersecurity attacks designed to trick victims into transferring sensitive data or funds, steal credentials or deploy malware that compromises information systems. If one of our employees were to fall victim to one of these attacks, or our information technology systems are compromised, our operations could be disrupted, or we may suffer financial loss, reputational loss, loss of customer business or other critical assets, or become exposed to regulatory fines and intervention or civil litigation. 
 
 Current uncertain economic conditions pose challenges, and could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 We are operating in an uncertain economic environment. The pandemic caused a global economic slowdown, and while we have seen some economic recovery, raw material shortages, supply chain issues and labor shortages risk slowing or reversing the continued recovery. Continued economic uncertainty and a recessionary or stagnant economy could result in financial stress on the Bank's borrowers, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We decreased the expense for credit losses over fiscal year 2021 as the economy began to recover, however, deteriorating conditions in the regional economy served by our Company, or in certain sectors of the economy, could drive losses beyond that which is provided for in our allowance for loan losses. We could also face the following risks in connection with the following events: 
 
 Market developments and economic stagnation or slowdown may affect consumer confidence levels and may cause adverse changes in payment patterns, resulting in increased delinquencies and default rates on loans and other credit facilities. 
 The processes we use to estimate the allowance for credit losses and other reserves may prove to be unreliable. Such estimates rely upon complex modeling inputs and judgments, including forecasts of economic conditions, which may be rendered inaccurate and/or no longer subject to accurate forecasting. 
 Our ability to assess the creditworthiness of our borrowers may be impaired if the models and approaches we use to select, manage, and underwrite loans become less predictive of future charge-offs. 
 Regulatory scrutiny of the industry could increase, leading to increased regulation of the industry that could lead to a higher cost of compliance, limit our ability to pursue business opportunities and increase our exposure to litigation or fines. 
 Ineffective monetary policy or other market conditions could cause rapid changes in interest rates and asset values that would have a materially adverse impact on our profitability and overall financial condition. 
 Further erosion in the fiscal condition of the U.S. Treasury could lead to new taxes that would limit our ability to pursue growth and return profits to shareholders. 
 
 If these conditions or similar ones continue to exist or worsen, we could experience continuing or increased adverse effects on our financial condition. 
 
 The continuing COVID-19 pandemic could adversely affect our business and our customers, counterparties, employees, and third-party service providers. 
 
 The spread of COVID-19 has created a global public-health crisis that has impacted household, business, economic, and market conditions, including in the western United States where we conduct nearly all of our business. 
 
 During 2021, we saw an improvement in macroeconomic variables used in the forecast component of the reserve partially offset by provisioning for new loan originations. Our provision expense was 500,000 in 2021, as compared to a 21,750,000 provision expense for the year ended September 30, 2020. As of September 30, 2021, our allowance for credit losses increased to 198,800,000. Additionally, throughout the pandemic our operations have been impacted by the need to close certain offices and limit how customers conduct business through our branch network. Many of our employees continue to work remotely, which exposes us to increased cybersecurity risks such as phishing, malware, and other cybersecurity attacks, all of which could expose us to liability and could seriously disrupt our business operations. 
 
 Governments have taken unprecedented financial and monetary steps in response to the pandemic. For example, in late March 2020, the CARES Act was enacted to inject more than 2 trillion of financial assistance into the U.S. economy, followed by additional COVID relief legislation of approximately 900 million in December 2020. In March 2021 the American Rescue Plan Act, also called the COVID-19 Stimulus Package or American Rescue Plan, Pub L. No. 117-2, was enacted to inject an additional 1.9 trillion in financial relief and economic stimulus. The Federal Reserve Bank has taken decisive and sweeping actions as well. Since March 15, 2020, their actions have included a reduction in the target range for the federal funds rate to 0 to 25 basis points, a program to purchase an indeterminate amount of Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities, corporate bonds and other investments, and numerous facilities to support the flow of credit to households and 
 
 22 

businesses. The federal funds rate remains at historic lows. The possibility of negative interest rates on U.S. Treasury or other market instruments could adversely affect our results of operations by, for example, reducing asset yields or spreads, creating operating and system issues, or having other adverse impacts on our business. 
 
 The full extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our capital, liquidity, and other financial positions and on our business, results of operations, and prospects is still uncertain, and will depend on a number of evolving factors, including: 
 
 The duration, extent, and severity of the pandemic . COVID-19 has not yet been contained; continuing spread and rise of new variants could affect significantly more households and businesses, or cause additional limitations on commercial activity, increased unemployment, increased property vacancy rates and general economic and financial instability. The continuation of the pandemic may also negatively impact regional economic conditions for a period of time, resulting in declines in loan demand and collateral values. The duration and severity of the pandemic continues to be impossible to predict, as is the potential for a seasonal or other resurgence. We also believe we will continue to see the economic effects of the pandemic even after the COVID-19 outbreak has subsided, which is expected to continue to affect our business, financial position, results of operations and prospects. 
 The response of governmental authorities . To date, many of the actions of governmental authorities, including eviction forbearance, occupancy restrictions and vaccine mandates, have been directed toward curtailing household and business activity to contain COVID-19 while simultaneously deploying fiscal and monetary policy measures to partially mitigate the adverse effects on individual households and businesses. The ultimate success or impact of these actions and their effect on our customers and the economy generally is still unclear. Further, some measures, such as a suspension of mortgage and other loan payments and foreclosures, may have a negative impact on our business. 
 The effect on our customers, counterparties, employees, and third-party service providers . COVID-19 and its associated consequences and uncertainties are affecting individuals, households, and businesses differently and unevenly. Negative impacts on our customers could result in increased risk of delinquencies, defaults, foreclosures and losses on our loans. 
 The effect on economies and markets . Whether the actions of governmental and nongovernmental authorities will be successful in mitigating the adverse effects of COVID-19 is unclear. National, regional, and local economies and markets could suffer disruptions that are lasting. Governmental actions are meaningfully influencing the interest-rate environment and financial-market activity and could have lasting effects on taxes and other economic factors, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. 
 
 As a participating lender in the SBA Paycheck Protection Program PPP ), we are subject to additional risks of litigation from our customers or other parties regarding our processing of loans for the PPP and risks that the SBA may not fund some or all PPP loan guaranties. 
 
 On March 27, 2020, President Trump signed the CARES Act, which included a loan program administered through the SBA referred to as the PPP. Under the PPP (and its expansion in 2021), small businesses and other entities and individuals were eligible to apply for loans from existing SBA lenders and other approved regulated lenders that enroll in the program, subject to numerous limitations and eligibility criteria. We have participated as a lender in the PPP, and through September 30, 2021, assisted approximately 9,000 businesses with 1,100,000 in PPP loans. 
 
 The PPP opened on April 3, 2020; however, because of the short timeframe between the passing of the CARES Act and the opening of the PPP, there was some ambiguity in the laws, rules and guidance regarding the operation of the PPP, which exposes us to potential risks relating to noncompliance with the PPP, and risks related to fair lending, violation of BSA/AML requirements and reputational risk. 
 
 Since the opening of the PPP, several other banks have been subject to litigation regarding the process and procedures that such banks used in processing applications for the PPP and claims related to agent fees. We may be exposed to the risk of similar litigation, from both customers and non-customers that approached us regarding PPP loans, regarding our process and procedures used in processing applications or forgiveness requests for the PPP, or litigation from agents with respect to agent fees. If any such litigation is filed against us and is not resolved in a favorable manner, it may result in significant financial liability or adversely affect the Company s reputation. In addition, litigation can be costly, regardless of outcome. Any financial liability, litigation costs or reputational damage caused by PPP-related litigation could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 We also have credit risk on PPP loans if a determination is made by the SBA that there is a deficiency in the manner in which a PPP loan was originated, funded, or serviced by us, such as an issue with the eligibility of a borrower to receive a PPP loan, which may or may not be related to the ambiguity in the laws, rules and guidance regarding the operation of the PPP. In the event of a loss resulting from a default on a PPP loan and a determination by the SBA that there was a deficiency in the manner in which the PPP loan was originated, funded, or serviced by us, the SBA may deny its liability under the guaranty, reduce the amount of the guaranty, or, if it has already paid under the guaranty, seek recovery of any loss related to the 
 
 23 

deficiency from us. As of September 30, 2021, approximately 7,000 PPP loans totaling 773,000,000 have been forgiven by the SBA, and we continued to hold PPP loans receivable of 305,162,000. 
 
 Regulatory and Litigation Risks 
 
 Failure to comply with the 2020 and 2013 Consent Orders from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau regarding our Home Mortgage Disclosure Act submissions could result in additional regulatory enforcement action. 
 
 In March 2020, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the CFPB Office of Enforcement formally notified us of alleged violations of the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act HMDA associated with our HMDA reporting submissions. The CFPB alleged that the Bank did not accurately report all required relevant information within the annual HMDA submissions. We responded to the CFPB, noting that the Bank has instituted enhanced procedures to ensure compliance with HMDA, and submitted amended HMDA filings. In October 2020, after further discussions with the CFPB, we entered into a consent order related to our HMDA reporting, under which we agreed to pay a 200,000 civil money penalty and implement a HMDA compliance management system while adhering to a compliance plan. The consent order will be in effect for 10 years. We had previously entered in a consent order with the CFPB in 2013, also relating to HMDA reporting deficiencies, resulting in a 34,000 civil money penalty. The 2013 HMDA Consent Order remains in effect. Any further deficiencies in our HMDA reporting submissions could result in additional regulatory enforcement actions, cause us to incur additional significant compliance costs and subject us to larger fines. Moreover, continued deficiencies in our HMDA reporting could have serious reputational consequences for the Bank. Any of these results could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 Non-Compliance with the USA PATRIOT Act, Bank Secrecy Act, Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, Truth-in-Lending Act, Community Reinvestment Act, Fair Lending Laws, Flood Insurance Reform Act or other laws and regulations could result in fines or sanctions, and curtail our expansion opportunities. 
 
 Financial institutions are required under the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 (the Patriot Act and Bank Secrecy Act ("BSA") to develop programs to prevent financial institutions from being used for money-laundering ("AML") and terrorist activities. Financial institutions are also obligated to file suspicious activity reports with the U.S. Treasury Department's Office of Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. These rules also require financial institutions to establish procedures for identifying and verifying the identity of customers seeking to open new financial accounts. Failure or the inability to comply with the Patriot Act and BSA statutes and regulations could result in fines or penalties, curtailment of expansion opportunities, enforcement actions, intervention or sanctions by regulators and costly litigation or expensive additional controls and systems. During the last few years, several banking institutions have received large fines for non-compliance with these laws and regulations, and we are subject to a Consent Order and have paid a civil money penalty with respect to our BSA Program, as described below. In addition, the U.S. Government imposed and is expected to continue to expand laws and regulations relating to residential and consumer lending activities that could create significant new compliance burdens and financial costs. 
 
 We remain subject to a Consent Order with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency with respect to our BSA compliance, requiring the Company to implement additional controls and systems and curtail expansion plans. We have paid a 2,500,000 civil money penalty and the Consent Order remains in effect. Any failure to comply with the Consent Order could result in additional regulatory enforcement action, including additional fines or sanctions. 
 
 The Bank Secrecy Act, the Patriot Act, and other laws and regulations require financial institutions, among other duties, to institute and maintain an effective anti-money laundering program and file suspicious activity and currency transaction reports as appropriate. On February 28, 2018, pursuant to a Stipulation and Consent to the Issuance of a Consent Order (the Stipulation ), the OCC issued a Consent Order relating to the Bank, the terms of which are intended to further enhance its BSA program. Copies of the Stipulation and the Consent Order were filed with the SEC on March 1, 2018 as exhibits to our Current Report on Form 8-K. Since the issuance of the Consent Order, the Bank has incurred significant expenses as it worked to strengthen its BSA/AML program and implemented additional policies and procedures associated with complying with the Consent Order. The Bank cannot pursue acquisitions or branch expansion while the Consent Order is in place. On September 30, 2021, the Bank announced that it had entered into an agreement with the OCC to pay a 2,500,000 civil money penalty associated with the deficiencies identified in the Stipulation and Consent Order. The payment of the civil penalty is an important milestone towards the Bank s resolution of the Consent Order, however, the Consent Order remains in place, and the OCC may take further government action with respect to the Bank s BSA program, including the imposition of additional fines, sanctions, additional expenses and compliance costs, and/or restrictions on the activities of the Bank. In addition, failure to comply with the Consent Order could subject us to additional expense and further regulatory enforcement action, including the imposition of material restrictions on the activities of the Bank or the assessment of fines or penalties, which could prevent the Bank from executing its business strategy and negatively impact its business. Moreover, failure to maintain and implement an effective BSA program could also have serious reputational consequences for the Bank. Any of these results could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 We operate in a highly regulated industry, which limits the manner and scope of our business activities. 

24 

We are subject to extensive supervision, regulation and examination by the OCC, CFPB and the FDIC. In addition, the Federal Reserve is responsible for regulating the holding company. This regulatory structure is designed primarily for the protection of the deposit insurance funds and consumers and not to benefit our shareholders. This regulatory structure also gives the regulatory authorities extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities and examination policies to address not only compliance with applicable laws and regulations (including laws and regulations governing consumer credit, and anti-money laundering and anti-terrorism laws), but also capital adequacy, asset quality and risk, management ability and performance, earnings, liquidity, data reporting and various other factors. As part of this regulatory structure, we are subject to policies and other guidance developed by the regulatory agencies with respect to capital levels, the timing and amount of dividend payments, the classification of assets and the establishment of adequate loan loss reserves for regulatory purposes. Under this structure the OCC, the FDIC, the CFPB and the Federal Reserve have broad discretion to impose restrictions and limitations on our operations if they determine, among other things, that our operations are unsafe or unsound, fail to comply with applicable law or are otherwise inconsistent with laws and regulations or with the supervisory policies of these agencies. This supervisory framework could materially impact the conduct, growth and profitability of our operations. 
 
 Failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations can result in a range of sanctions and enforcement actions, including the imposition of civil money penalties, formal agreements and cease and desist orders; identified deficiencies in our HMDA reporting and BSA/AML programs have resulted in Consent Orders from the CFPB and OCC, required us to incur significant expenses and compliance costs and subjected us to civil penalties. Failure to meet regulatory requirements could require the Bank to incur additional significant costs in order to bring our programs and operations into compliance, negatively impact our reputation, and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 In addition, the OCC has specific authority to take prompt corrective action, depending on the Bank's capital level. Currently, the Bank is considered well-capitalized for prompt corrective action purposes. If the Bank were designated by the OCC as adequately capitalized, its ability to take brokered deposits would become limited. If the Bank were to be designated by the OCC in one of the lower capital levels undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized or critically undercapitalized, it would be required to raise additional capital and would be subject to progressively more severe restrictions on its operations, management and capital distributions, and replacement of senior executive officers and directors. If the Bank became critically undercapitalized, it would also be subject to the appointment of a conservator or receiver. 
 
 Recent national and state legislation and regulatory initiatives to support the financial services industry have been coupled with numerous restrictions and requirements that could detrimentally affect our business. 
 
 The Dodd-Frank Act has had a substantial impact on the financial services industry since its passage in 2010. The Dodd-Frank Act creates a framework through which regulatory reform has been and continues to be written. While many of the rules required by the Dodd-Frank Act have been implemented, others are still being drafted. As a result, the impact of the future regulatory requirements continues to be uncertain. We expect the way we conduct business to continue to be affected by these regulatory requirements, including through limitations on our ability to pursue certain lines of business, capital requirements, enhanced reporting obligations, and increased costs. 
 
 Other legislative initiatives could detrimentally impact our operations in the future. The extent of the impact of any such legislation will be dependent on the specific details of the final legislation passed, if any. 
 
 Deposit insurance premiums could increase further in the future. 
 
 The FDIC insures deposits at FDIC-insured financial institutions, including the Bank. The FDIC charges insured financial institutions premiums to maintain the Deposit Insurance Fund ("DIF") at a specific level. The Bank's FDIC insurance premiums increased substantially beginning in 2009, and could increase significantly in the future. Unfavorable economic conditions, increased bank failures and additional failures decreased the DIF. In order to restore the DIF to its statutorily mandated minimum of 1.35 of total deposits, the FDIC may need to increase deposit insurance premium rates. Insured institutions with assets of 10 billion or more are responsible for funding this increase. The FDIC has issued regulations to implement these provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. The FDIC has also established a higher reserve ratio of 2 as a long term goal and the minimum level needed to withstand future financial crises of the magnitude of past crises. The FDIC may increase the assessment rates or impose additional special assessments in the future to keep the DIF at the statutory target level. Any increase in the Bank's FDIC premiums could have an adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 We are subject to various claims and litigation, which could result in significant expenses, losses and damage to our reputation. 
 
 We are, from time to time, subject to claims and proceedings related to our operations. These claims and legal actions could include supervisory or enforcement actions by our regulators, criminal proceedings by prosecutorial authorities, or civil claims by our customers, former customers, contractual counterparties, and current and former employees. We may also face class action lawsuits for alleged violations of employment, state wage and hour and consumer protection laws. These claims could involve large monetary demands, including civil money penalties or fines imposed by government authorities, and 
 
 25 

significant defense costs. If such claims and legal actions are brought, and are not resolved in a manner favorable to the Company, they could result in financial liability and/or reputational harm, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 Banking institutions are also increasingly the target of class action lawsuits, most recently claiming deceptive practices or violations of account terms in connection with non-sufficient funds or overdraft charges. In September 2020, we received notice a similar class action had been filed against the Bank, alleging that we have been improperly charging our customers overdraft fees on items re-presented for payment. A lawsuit against the Bank for non-sufficient funds and overdraft charges for re-presented items is pending. We do not believe the claims have merit, and are opposing the lawsuit and the certification of the class. However, the results of litigation are inherently unpredictable, and defending against these claims is expected to be time consuming and costly, and could require significant amounts of management time and divert significant resources. If this or another class action lawsuit is determined adversely to us, or we were to enter into a settlement agreement in connection with such a matter, we could be exposed to monetary damages, reputational harm, or subject to limits on our ability to operate our business, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, and operating results. 
 
 Market and Industry Risks 
 
 Our operations are focused in the western United States, subjecting us to the risks of general economic conditions in these market areas. 
 
 Substantially all of the Bank's loans are to individuals, businesses and real estate developers in the Pacific Northwest, Arizona, Utah, Texas, New Mexico and Nevada. As a result, our business depends significantly on general economic conditions in these market areas. A substantial increase in unemployment rates, or severe declines in housing prices and property values in these primary market areas could have a material adverse effect on our business due to a number of factors, including: 
 
 Loan delinquencies may increase. 
 Problem assets and foreclosures may increase. 
 Demand for the Bank's products and services may decline. 
 Collateral for loans made by the Bank, especially real estate, may decline in value, in turn reducing a customer's borrowing power and reducing the value of assets and collateral associated with the loans. 
 Natural disasters and catastrophic events such as wildfires, floods and earthquakes may damage or destroy collateral for loans made by the Bank and negatively impact the collateral s value and a customer s ability to repay loans. 
 
 A downturn in the real estate market would hurt our business. 
 
 The Bank s business activities and credit exposure are concentrated in real estate lending. The market for real estate is cyclical and the outlook for this sector is uncertain. A downturn in the real estate market, accompanied by falling values and increased foreclosures would hurt our business because a large majority of our loans are secured by real estate. 
 
 If a significant decline in market values occurs, the collateral for loans will provide decreasing levels of security. As a result, our ability to recover the principal amount due on defaulted loans by selling the underlying real estate will be diminished, and we will be more likely to suffer losses on defaulted loans. 
 
 We own real estate as a result of foreclosures resulting from non-performing loans. If other lenders or borrowers liquidate significant amounts of real estate in a rapid or disorderly fashion, or if the FDIC elects to dispose of significant amounts of real estate from failed financial institutions in a similar fashion, it could have an adverse effect on the values of the properties owned by the Company by depressing the value of these real estate holdings. In such a case, we may incur further write-downs and charge-offs, which could, in turn, adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 Changes in retail distribution strategies and consumer behavior may adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 We have significant investments in bank premises and equipment for our branch network as well as our retail work force and other branch banking assets. Advances in technology such as e-commerce, telephone, internet and mobile banking, and in-branch self-service technologies including automatic teller machines and other equipment, as well as changing customer preferences for these other methods of accessing our products and services, could decrease the value of our branch network or other retail distribution assets and may cause us to change our retail distribution strategy, close and/or sell certain branches or parcels of land held for development and restructure or reduce our remaining branches and work force. These actions could lead to losses on these assets or could adversely impact the carrying value of other long-lived assets and may lead to increased expenditures to renovate and reconfigure remaining branches or to otherwise reform our retail distribution channel. In addition, any changes in our branch network strategy could adversely impact our business, financial condition or operations if it results in the loss of customers or deposits which we rely on as a low cost and stable source of funds for our loans and operations. 
 
 26 

We may suffer losses in our loan portfolio due to inadequate or faulty underwriting and loan collection practices. 
 
 There are risks inherent in any loan portfolio, which we attempt to address by adhering to specific underwriting and loan collection practices. Underwriting practices often include analysis of a borrower's prior credit history; financial statements; tax returns; cash flow projections; valuation of collateral; personal guarantees of loans to businesses; and verification of liquid assets. If the underwriting process fails to capture accurate information or proves to be inadequate, we may incur losses on loans that appeared to meet our underwriting criteria, and those losses may exceed the amounts set aside as reserves in the allowance for credit losses. Loan collection resources may be expanded to meet increases in nonperforming loans resulting from economic downturns or to service any loans acquired, resulting in higher loan administration costs. We are also exposed to the risk of improper documentation of foreclosure proceedings that would also increase the cost of collection. 
 
 Our business is subject to interest rate risk, and changes in market interest rates may negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 Our primary source of income is net interest income, which is the difference between the interest income generated by interest-earning assets and the interest expense generated by interest-bearing liabilities. The level of net interest income is a function of the average balances of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and the spread between the amounts of the yield on such assets and the cost of such liabilities. These factors are influenced by both the pricing and the mix of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities which, in turn, are impacted by such external factors as the local economy, competition for loans and deposits, the monetary policy of the Federal Open Market Committee of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors (the FOMC and market interest rates. Management is unable to predict these external factors, including the fluctuations of market interest rates, which are affected by many drivers, including inflation, recession, unemployment, monetary policy, domestic and international disorder, instability in domestic and foreign financial markets and investor and consumer demand. 
 
 Furthermore, movements in interest rates, the pace at which such movements occur and the volume and mix of our interest-bearing assets and liabilities influence the level of net interest income. The cost of customer deposits is largely based on short-term interest rates, the level of which is driven by the FOMC. However, the yields generated by long-term loans, such as single-family residential and multifamily mortgage loans, and securities are typically driven by longer-term (10 year) interest rates, which are set by the market and vary from day to day. During the last few years, the Federal Reserve's unprecedented involvement in the purchase of assets, commonly known as "quantitative easing," has caused interest rates to be lower than they would have been without such involvement. The COVID-19 pandemic has led the Federal Reserve to reverse its unwinding of quantitative easing and instead dramatically increase their non-traditional activities. These activities suppress long-term interest rates and could lead to unforeseen consequences. 
 
 If the interest rates on interest-bearing liabilities increase at a faster pace than the interest rates on interest-earning assets, the result could be a reduction in our net interest income and with it, a reduction in earnings. The same could be true if interest rates on interest-earning assets decline faster than the rates on interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest income and earnings would be similarly impacted were the interest rates on interest-earning assets to decline more quickly than the interest rates on interest-bearing liabilities. In addition, changes in interest rates could affect the Bank's ability to originate loans and attract and retain deposits; the fair values of its securities and other financial assets; the fair values of its liabilities; and the average lives of its loan and securities portfolios. Additionally, decreases in interest rates could lead to increased loan refinancing activity, which, in turn, would alter the balance of our interest-earning assets and impact net interest income. Increases in interest rates could reduce loan refinancing activity, which could result in compression of the spread between loan yields and more quickly rising funding rates. 
 
 We may also be exposed to movements in market rates to a degree not experienced by other financial institutions, as a result of our significant portfolio of fixed-rate single-family home loans, which are longer-term in nature than the customer accounts and borrowed money that constitute our liabilities. 
 
 Our liquidity may be adversely impacted by issues arising from certain industry deficiencies in foreclosure practices, including delays and challenges in the foreclosure process. 
 
 Foreclosure process issues and the potential legal and regulatory responses to them could negatively impact the process and timing to completion of foreclosures for residential mortgage lenders, including the Bank. Due to the COVID-19 emergency, certain states in which we do business have enacted temporary stays on evictions and foreclosures, or instituted a right to forbearance for homeowners experiencing financial hardship. Foreclosure timelines have increased in recent years due to, among other reasons, delays associated with the significant increase in the number of foreclosure cases as a result of economic downturns, additional consumer protection initiatives related to the foreclosure process and voluntary or mandatory programs intended to permit or require lenders to consider loan modifications or other alternatives to foreclosure. Should these stays or rights to forbearance continue, we may be limited in our inability to take timely possession of real estate assets collateralizing loans, which may increase our loan losses. Increases in the foreclosure timeline may also have an adverse effect on collateral values and the our ability to minimize our losses. 

27 

The replacement of the LIBOR benchmark interest rate may have an impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations. 
 
 Certain loans made by us are made at variable rates that use LIBOR as a benchmark for establishing the interest rate. In addition, we also have investments and interest rate derivatives that reference LIBOR. On July 27, 2017, the United Kingdom s Financial Conduct Authority ("FCA") announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit LIBOR rates after 2021. On November 30, 2020 to facilitate an orderly LIBOR transition the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve jointly announced that entering into new contacts using LIBOR as a reference rate after December 31, 2021 would create a safety and soundness risk. On March 5, 2021, the FCA announced that all LIBOR settings will either cease to be provided by any administrator or no longer be representative immediately after December 31, 2021, in the case of 1-week and 2-month U.S. dollar LIBOR, and immediately after June 30, 2023, in the case of the remaining U.S. dollar LIBOR settings. In the United States, efforts to identify a set of alternative U.S. dollar reference interest rates are ongoing, and the Alternative Reference Rate Committee ("ARRC") has recommended the use of a Secured Overnight Funding Rate ("SOFR"). SOFR is different from LIBOR in that it is a backward looking secured rate rather than a forward looking unsecured rate. These differences could lead to a greater disconnect between the Bank's costs to raise funds for SOFR as compared to LIBOR. For cash products and loans, the ARRC has also recommended Term SOFR, which is a forward looking SOFR based on SOFR futures and may in part reduce differences between SOFR and LIBOR. To further reduce differences between replacement indices and substitute indices market practitioners have also gravitated towards credit sensitive rates, the leading among them being the Bloomberg Short-term Bank Yield Index BSBY ). The ARRC announced on October 21, 2020 that they are not well positioned to adjudicate the development of a credit sensitive rate and will not criticize firms solely for using reference rates other than SOFR, such as BSBY. The Company has prepared to originate new loans to customers based on SOFR, Term SOFR and BSBY. There are also operational issues which may create a delay in the transition to SOFR or other substitute indices, leading to uncertainty across the industry. The implementation of a substitute index or indices for the calculation of interest rates under our loan agreements with our borrowers may incur significant expenses in effecting the transition, may result in reduced loan balances if borrowers do not accept the substitute index or indices, and may result in disputes or litigation with customers over the appropriateness or comparability to LIBOR of the substitute index or indices, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. These reforms may cause LIBOR to cease to exist, new methods of calculating LIBOR to be established or the establishment of multiple alternative reference rate(s). These consequences cannot be entirely predicted and could have an adverse impact on the market value for or value of LIBOR-linked securities, loans, and other financial obligations or extensions of credit held by or due to us. 
 
 Competitive Risks 
 
 Our ability to originate mortgage loans has been adversely affected by the increased competition resulting from the involvement of the U.S. Government, the Federal Reserve and Government-Sponsored Enterprises GSEs in the residential mortgage market. 
 
 Over the past few years, we have faced increased competition for mortgage loans due to the increased involvement of the GSEs in the mortgage market, which has caused interest rates for thirty year fixed-rate mortgage loans that conform to GSE guidelines to remain artificially low. Mortgage loan repayments on one-to-four family residential properties have been elevated, and it is possible that these mortgage loan repayments will outpace our loan production as a result of this competition, making it difficult for us to grow our mortgage loan portfolio and balance sheet, and having an adverse effect on our business. 
 
 The Bank faces strong competition from other financial institutions and new market participants, offering services similar to those offered by the Bank. 
 
 Many competitors, including fintech companies, offer the same types of loan and deposit services that the Company offers. These competitors include other national banks, savings associations, community banks, credit unions and other financial intermediaries. In particular, our competitors include national banks and major financial companies whose greater resources may afford them a marketplace advantage by enabling them to maintain numerous banking locations and mount extensive promotional and advertising campaigns. Additionally, recent technological breakthroughs have made it possible for other non-traditional competitors to enter the marketplace and compete for traditional banking services. Increased competition within our geographic market area may result in reduced loan originations and deposits. Ultimately, competition from current and future competitors may affect our business materially and adversely. 
 
 Security Ownership Risks 
 
 Our ability to pay dividends is subject to limitations that may affect our ability to continue to pay dividends to Shareholders. 
 
 We are a separate legal entity from our bank subsidiary and do not have significant operations of our own. The availability of dividends from the Bank is limited by the Bank's earnings and capital, as well as various statutes and regulations. It is possible, depending upon the financial condition of the Bank and other factors, that the Bank may not be able to pay dividends to the Company. If the Bank is unable to pay dividends to the Company, then we may not be able to pay dividends on 
 
 28 

our preferred or common stock to our shareholders. There are various federal law limitations on the extent to which the Bank can finance or otherwise supply funds to Washington Federal through dividends and loans. These limitations include capital adequacy regulations and policies of its regulators generally and specifically the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, Prompt Corrective Action regulations, federal banking law requirements concerning the payment of dividends out of net profits or surplus, Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and Regulation W governing transactions between an insured depository institution and its affiliates, as well as general federal regulatory oversight to prevent unsafe or unsound practices. If the Bank earnings are not sufficient to make dividend payments to us while maintaining adequate capital levels, then our liquidity may be affected and our stock price may be negatively affected by our inability to pay dividends, which will have an adverse impact on both the Company and our shareholders. 
 
 Our 4.875 Fixed Rate Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series A Series A Preferred Stock ranks senior to our common stock, and we are prohibited from paying dividends on our common stock unless we have paid dividends on our Series A Preferred. 
 
 Shares of our Series A Preferred Stock rank senior to our common stock with respect to the payment of dividends and distributions of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up. Holders of Series A Preferred Stock are entitled to receive, when, as, and if declared by our Board of Directors (or a duly authorized committee of our Board of Directors), out of assets legally available for the payment of dividends under Washington law, non-cumulative cash dividends based on the liquidation preference of the Series A Preferred Stock at a rate equal to 4.875 per annum for each quarterly dividend period, beginning on April 15, 2021. If we do not or are unable to pay quarterly dividends on our Series A Preferred Stock, we may not pay a dividend to the holders of our common stock. Our stock price may be negatively affected by our inability to pay dividends, which will have an adverse impact on both the Company and our shareholders. 
 
 In addition, if we fail to pay, or declare and set apart for payment, dividends on our Series A Preferred Stock for six quarterly dividend periods, whether or not consecutive, the number of directors on our Board of Directors will automatically be increased by two, and the holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock will have the right to elect two additional members of our Board of Directors (the Preferred Stock Directors to fill such newly created directorships. 
 
 The market price for our common stock may be volatile. 
 
 The market price of our common stock could fluctuate substantially in the future in response to a number of factors, including those discussed below. The market price of our common stock has in the past fluctuated significantly. We expect to see additional volatility in the financial markets due to the uncertainty caused by the continuing COVID-19 pandemic, disruption in global supply chains, uncertainty over the U.S. government debt ceiling and changing Federal Reserve policy. Some additional factors that may cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate include: 
 
 general conditions in the financial markets and real estate markets 
 macro-economic and political conditions in the U. S. and the financial markets generally (including the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic) 
 variations in the operating results of the Company and our competitors 
 events affecting other companies that the market deems comparable to the Company 
 changes in securities analysts' estimates of our future performance and the future performance of our competitors 
 announcements by the Company or our competitors of mergers, acquisitions and strategic partnerships 
 additions or departure of key personnel 
 the presence or absence of short selling of the Company's common stock 
 future sales by us of our common stock or debt securities 
 
 The stock markets in general have experienced substantial price and trading fluctuations. These fluctuations have resulted in volatility in the market prices of securities that often has been unrelated or disproportionate to changes in operating performance. These broad market fluctuations are expected to continue for the near future, and may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock. 
 
 General market conditions and unpredictable factors could adversely affect market prices for the depositary shares. 
 
 Our outstanding depositary shares, each representing a 1/40th Interest in a share of our 4.875 Fixed Rate Series A Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, are traded on the Nasdaq Stock Market, and are subject to the same volatility risks that affect our common stock, as described above. In addition, trading prices of the depositary shares will depend on many factors, including: 
 
 whether we declare or fail to declare dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock from time to time; 
 
 29 

our creditworthiness; 
 the ratings given to our securities by credit-rating agencies, including the ratings given to the Series A Preferred Stock or depositary shares; 
 prevailing interest rates; and 
 the market for similar securities. 
 
 Accordingly, the depositary shares may trade at a discount to the price per share paid for such shares, even if a secondary market for the depositary shares develops. 
 
 There may be future sales or other dilution of the Company's equity, which may adversely affect the market price of our common stock or depositary shares. 
 
 We are not restricted from issuing additional shares of common stock, preferred stock, or securities that are convertible into or exchangeable for, or that represent the right to receive, common stock or preferred stock. Our Board of Directors is authorized to cause Washington Federal to issue one or more classes or series of preferred stock junior to our Series A Preferred Stock from time to time without any action on the part of our shareholders, and our Board of Directors also has the power, without shareholder approval, to set the terms of any such classes or series of preferred stock that may be issued, including voting rights, dividend rights, and preferences over the common stock with respect to dividends or upon our dissolution, winding up and liquidation and other terms. Although the approval of holders of depositary shares representing interests in the Series A Preferred Stock will be needed to issue any equity security ranking above the Series A Preferred Stock, if we were to issue preferred stock in the future that has preference over the Series A Preferred Stock with respect to the payment of dividends or upon liquidation, or if we were to issue preferred stock with voting rights that dilute the voting power of the Series A Preferred Stock or depositary shares, the rights of holders of the depositary shares or the market price of the depositary shares could be adversely affected. 
 
 The issuance of any additional shares of common or of preferred stock or convertible securities or the exercise of such securities could be substantially dilutive to existing shareholders. For instance, exercise of the warrant issued to the U.S. Treasury in connection with our participation in the Capital Purchase Program diluted the value of our common stock. We may also elect to use common stock to fund new acquisitions, which will dilute existing shareholders. Holders of our common stock have no preemptive rights that entitle holders to purchase their pro rata share of any offering of shares of any class or series and, therefore, such sales or offerings could result in increased dilution to our shareholders. 
 
 We rely, in part, on external financing to fund our operations and the unavailability of such funding in the future could adversely impact our growth and prospects. 
 
 We rely on customer deposits, advances from the FHLB of Des Moines and other borrowings to fund our operations. Management has historically been able to replace maturing deposits, if desired; however, we may not be able to replace such funds at any given point in time if our financial condition or market conditions change or if the cost of doing so might adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 Although we consider current sources of funds adequate for our liquidity needs, we may seek additional debt in the future to achieve our long-term business objectives. Such borrowings, if sought, may not be available to us or, if available, may not be on favorable terms. If additional financing sources are unavailable or are not available on reasonable terms, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected. 
 
 A person holding our common stock could have the voting power of their shares of common stock on all matters significantly reduced under Washington's anti-takeover statutes, if the person acquires 10 or more of the voting stock of the Company. 
 
 We are incorporated in the state of Washington and subject to Washington state law. Some provisions of Washington state law could interfere with or restrict takeover bids or other change-in-control events affecting us. For example, Chapter 23B.19 of the Washington Business Corporation Act, with limited exceptions, prohibits a target corporation from engaging in specified significant business transactions for a period of five years after the share acquisition by an acquiring person, unless: 
 
 the prohibited transaction or the acquiring person's purchase of shares was approved by a majority of the members of the target corporation's board of directors prior to the acquiring person's share acquisition; or 
 the prohibited transaction was both approved by the majority of the members of the target corporation's board and authorized at a shareholder meeting by at least two-thirds of the outstanding voting shares (excluding the acquiring person's shares) at or subsequent to the acquiring person's share acquisition. An acquiring person is defined as a person or group of persons that beneficially own 10 or more of the voting securities of the target corporation. Such prohibited transactions include, among other things: 
 
 30 

certain mergers, or consolidations with, disposition of assets to, or issuances of stock to or redemption of stock from, the acquiring person; 
 termination of 5 or more of the employees of the target corporation as a result of the acquiring person's acquisition of 10 or more of the shares; 
 allowing the acquiring person to receive any disproportionate benefit as a shareholder; and 
 liquidating or dissolving the target corporation. 
 
 After the five-year period, certain significant business transactions are permitted, if they comply with certain fair price provisions of the statute or are approved by a majority of the outstanding shares other than those of which the acquiring person has beneficial ownership. As a Washington corporation, the Company is not permitted to opt out of this statute.

PART II 

Item 5. Market for Registrant s Common Equity, Related Shareholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities 
 
 Common Stock 
 
 The Company s common stock is traded on the Nasdaq Global Select Market of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC under the symbol WAFD. At September 30, 2021, the number of shareholders of record was 996. This figure does not represent the actual number of beneficial owners of common stock because shares are frequently held in street name by securities dealers and others for the benefit of individual owners who may vote the shares. 
 
 Additional information about stock options and other equity compensation plans is included in Note P to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report. 
 
 The Company s ability to pay dividends is subject to bank regulatory requirements, including (but not limited to) the capital adequacy regulations and policies established by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. The Company s Board of Directors' dividend policy is to review our financial performance, capital adequacy, regulatory compliance and cash resources on a quarterly basis, and, if such review is favorable, to declare and pay a quarterly cash dividend to common shareholders. 
 
 The Company s 4.875 Fixed Rate Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series A (the Series A Preferred ), ranks senior to the Company s common stock with respect to payment of dividends, and dividends (if declared) accrue and are payable on the Series A Preferred a rate of 4.875 per annum, payable quarterly, in arrears. While the Series A Preferred is outstanding, unless the full dividend for the preceding quarterly period is paid in full, or declared and a sum set aside, no dividend may be declared or paid on the Company s common stock. 
 
 Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities 
 
 The Company s stock repurchase program was publicly announced by the board of directors on February 3, 1995 and has no expiration date.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES 
 The Company has determined that the only accounting policy critical to an understanding of its consolidated financial statements relates to the methodology for determining the amount of the allowance for credit losses ACL ). 
 Management s determination of the amount of the ACL is a critical accounting estimate as it requires significant reliance on the credit risk we ascribe to individual borrowers, the use of estimates and significant judgment as to the amount and timing of expected future cash flows on individually evaluated loans, significant reliance on historical loss rates on homogenous portfolios, consideration of our quantitative and qualitative evaluation of past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amounts. 
 
 Going forward, the methodology used to calculate the ACL will be significantly influenced by the composition, characteristics and quality of our loan portfolio, as well as the prevailing economic conditions and forecasts utilized. Material changes to these and other relevant factors may result in greater volatility to the allowance for credit losses, and therefore, greater volatility in our reported earnings. 
 Select information regarding the ACL is below in "Allowance for Credit Losses." For further details, see Note s A and E to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data .

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

The following table shows changes in the Company's allowance for credit losses since the prior year. 
 September 30, 2021 September 30, 2020 Change Change (In thousands) Allowance for credit losses: Commercial loans Multi-family 16,949 13,853 3,096 22 Commercial real estate 23,437 22,516 921 4 Commercial industrial 45,957 38,665 7,292 19 Construction 25,585 24,156 1,429 6 Land - acquisition development 13,447 10,733 2,714 25 Total commercial loans 125,375 109,923 15,452 14 Consumer loans Single-family residential 30,978 45,186 (14,208) (31) Construction - custom 4,907 3,555 1,352 38 Land - consumer lot loans 4,939 2,729 2,210 81 HELOC 2,390 2,571 (181) (7) Consumer 2,711 2,991 (280) (9) Total consumer loans 45,925 57,032 (11,107) (19) Total allowance for loan losses 171,300 166,955 4,345 3 Reserve for unfunded commitments 27,500 25,000 2,500 10 Total allowance for credit losses 198,800 191,955 6,845 4 
 
 The allowance for loan losses increased by 4,345,000, or 2.60 , from 166,955,000 as of September 30, 2020, to 171,300,000 at September 30, 2021. As of September 30, 2021, the allowance of 171,300,000 is for loans that are evaluated on a pooled basis, which was comprised of 120,357,000 related to the quantitative component and 50,943,000 related to management's qualitative overlays. 
 The Company recorded a provision for credit losses of 500,000 in 2021, compared to a provision of 21,750,000 for 2020. The significant provision in 2020 was due to higher expected losses with the onset of the global pandemic. In 2021, provisioning for net growth in the loan portfolio was mostly offset by releases related to improvements in macroeconomic variables used in the forecast component of the reserve. For the year ended September 30, 2021, net recoveries were 6,345,000, compared to 3,271,000 in the prior year. No allowance was recorded as of September 30, 2021 for the 305,162,000 of PPP loans, which are included in the commercial industrial loan category, due to the government guarantee. The ratio of the total ACL to total gross loans decreased to 1.22 as of September 30, 2021, as compared to 1.33 as of September 30, 2020. The decrease was primarily related to improvements in macroeconomic variables used in the forecast component of the ACL. 
 The reserve for unfunded loan commitments was 27,500,000 as of September 30, 2021, compared to 25,000,000 as of September 30, 2020. 
 Management believes the total ACL is sufficient to absorb estimated losses inherent in the portfolio of loans and unfunded commitments.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

 ASSET QUALITY 
 Troubled debt restructured loans ("TDRs"). TDRs are reserved for under the Company's CECL methodology. Most TDRs are performing and accruing loans where the borrower has proactively approached the Company about modifications due to temporary financial difficulties. Each request is individually evaluated for merit and likelihood of success. The concession for these loans is typically a payment reduction through a rate reduction of 100 to 200 basis points for a specific term, usually six to twelve months. Interest-only payments may also be approved during the modification period. 
 Concessions for construction, land A D and multi-family loans are typically an extension of maturity combined with a rate reduction of normally 100 basis points. Before granting approval to modify a loan in a TDR, a borrower s ability to repay is considered by evaluating current income levels, debt-to-income ratio, credit score, loan payment history and an updated evaluation of the secondary repayment source. 
 
 If a loan is on non-accrual status before becoming a TDR, it will stay on non-accrual status following restructuring until it has been performing for at least six months, at which point it may be moved to accrual status. If a loan is on accrual status before it becomes a TDR, and it is concluded that a full repayment is highly probable, it will remain on accrual status following restructuring. If the homogeneous restructured loan does not perform, it is placed in non-accrual status when it is 90 days delinquent. For commercial loans, six consecutive payments on newly restructured loan terms are required prior to returning the loan to accrual status. After the required six consecutive payments are made, a management assessment may conclude that collection of the entire principal and interest due is still in doubt. In those instances, the loan will remain on non-accrual. A loan that defaults and is subsequently modified would impact the Company's delinquency trend, which is part of the qualitative risk factors component of the CECL methodology. Any modified loan that re-defaults and is charged-off would impact the quantitative component of the CECL methodology. 
 
 Non-Performing Assets. When a borrower violates a condition of a loan, the Bank attempts to cure the default by contacting the borrower. In most cases, defaults are cured promptly. If the default is not cured within an appropriate time frame, typically 90 days, the Bank may institute appropriate action to collect the loan, such as making demand for payment or initiating foreclosure proceedings on the collateral. If foreclosure occurs, the collateral will typically be sold at public auction and may be purchased by the Bank. 
 Loans are placed on nonaccrual status when, in the judgment of management, the probability of collecting interest or principal is deemed to be insufficient to warrant further accrual. When a loan is placed on nonaccrual status, previously accrued but unpaid interest is deducted from interest income. The Bank does not accrue interest on loans 90 days past due or more. See Note A to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 hereof for additional information. 
 The Bank will consider modifying the interest rate and terms of a loan if it determines that a modification is deemed to be the best option available for collection in full or to minimize the loss to the Bank. Most loans restructured in TDRs are accruing and performing loans where the borrower has proactively approached the Bank about a modification due to temporary financial difficulties. Each request is individually evaluated for merit and likelihood of success. The modification of these loans is typically a payment reduction through a rate reduction of from 100 to 200 bps for a specific term, usually six to twelve months. Interest-only payments may also be approved during the modification period. Principal forgiveness generally is not an available option for restructured loans. As of September 30, 2021, single-family residential loans comprised 92.1 of restructured loans. The Bank reserves for restructured loans within its pool based general reserve methodology, except in instances where management considers it appropriate to evaluate individually. 
 Real estate acquired by foreclosure or deed-in-lieu thereof REO or Real Estate Owned is classified as real estate held for sale. When property is acquired, it is recorded at the fair market value less estimated selling costs at the date of acquisition. Interest accrual ceases on the date of acquisition and all costs incurred in maintaining the property from that date forward are expensed as incurred. Costs incurred for the improvement or development of such property is capitalized. See Note A to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 hereof for additional information.

 ___________________ 
 (1) For the year ended September 30, 2021, the Company recognized 9,354,000 in interest income on cash payments received from borrowers on non-accrual loans. The Company would have recognized interest income of 1,373,000 for the same period had these loans performed according to their original contract terms. The recognized interest income may include more than twelve months of interest for some of the non-accrual loans that were brought current or paid off. In addition to the non-accrual loans reflected in the above table, the Company had 355,151,000 of loans that were less than 90 days delinquent at September 30, 2021 but were classified as substandard for one or more reasons. If these loans were deemed non-performing, the Company's ratio of total non-performing assets and performing restructured loans as a percent of total assets would have increased to 2.35 at September 30, 2021. For a discussion of the Company's policy for placing loans on non-accrual status, see Note A to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report. 
 
 Non-performing assets increased 15.7 to 43,625,000, or 0.22 of total assets, at September 30, 2021, compared to 37,695,000, or 0.20 of total assets, at September 30, 2020. The increase was primarily a result of 2,693,000 higher non-accrual loans and 3,238,000 higher real estate owned. Other property owned of 3,672,000 as of September 30, 2021 is comprised of 896,000 of equipment acquired through foreclosure on a commercial loan and a 2,776,000 government guarantee related to that same loan.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

 TDRs declined to 65,128,000 as of September 30, 2021, from 91,408,000 as of September 30, 2020. As of September 30, 2021, 63,655,000 or 97.7 of TDRs were performing. Non-performing TDRs of 1,473,000 are included in NPAs. Total NPAs and performing TDRs as a percent of total assets has declined to 0.55 as of September 30, 2021, from 0.67 as of September 30, 2020. During 2021, there were TDR additions of 1,511,000 and reductions of 27,790,000 due to prepayments and transfers to REO. As of September 30, 2021, 92.1 of TDRs are comprised of single-family residential loans. 
 
 As of September 30, 2021, real estate owned totaled 8,204,000, an increase of 3,238,000, or 65.2 , from 4,966,000 as of September 30, 2020, as new REO properties were partially offset by sales of foreclosed properties. During 2021, the Company sold real estate owned properties for total net proceeds of 3,340,000. The majority of REO properties are former bank premises that are expected to be sold. 
 The ratio of the allowance for loan losses to non-accrual loans decreased to 540 as of September 30, 2021, from 575 as of September 30, 2020.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

 CHANGES IN FINANCIAL CONDITION 
 Cash and cash equivalents : Cash and cash equivalents increased to 2,090,809,000 at September 30, 2021, as compared to 1,702,977,000 at September 30, 2020. The change was primarily due to the 1,762,488,000 increase in customer accounts, the majority of which was used to fund growth in the loan portfolio and pay down FHLB borrowings. Changes in investment securities balances discussed below also contributed to growth in cash and cash equivalents. 
 Available-for-sale investment securities : Available-for-sale securities decreased 111,233,000, or 4.9 , during the year ended September 30, 2021, to 2,138,259,000, primarily due to principal repayments of 646,532,000 and sales of 1,499,000, partially offset by purchases of 530,227,000. As of September 30, 2021, the Company had a net unrealized gain on available-for-sale securities of 48,189,000, which is recorded net of tax as part of shareholders' equity. 
 Substantially all of the Company s available-for-sale debt securities are issued by U.S. government agencies or U.S. government-sponsored enterprises. These securities carry the explicit and/or implicit guarantee of the U.S. government and have a long history of zero credit loss. The remaining securities are issued by highly-rated municipalities or corporate borrowers. The Company does not believe that any of its available-for-sale debt securities have credit loss impairment as of September 30, 2021, therefore, no allowance was recorded. The impact going forward will depend on the composition, characteristics, and credit quality of the loan and securities portfolios as well as the economic conditions at future reporting periods. 
 Held-to-maturity investment securities : Held-to-maturity securities decreased by 339,813,000, or 48.1 , during the year ended September 30, 2021, to 366,025,000 primarily due to principal repayments and maturities of 332,001,000. There were no held-to-maturity securities purchased or sold during the year ended September 30, 2021. Rising interest rates may cause these securities to be subject to unrealized losses. As of September 30, 2021, the net unrealized gain on held-to-maturity securities was 13,522,000, which management attributes to the change of interest rates since acquisition. 
 Substantially all of the Company s held-to-maturity debt securities are issued by U.S. government agencies or U.S. government-sponsored enterprises. These securities carry the explicit and/or implicit guarantee of the U.S. government and have a long history of zero credit loss. The Company did not record an allowance for credit losses for held-to-maturity securities as of September 30, 2021 as the investment portfolio consists primarily of U.S. government agency mortgage-backed securities that management deems to have immaterial risk of loss. The impact going forward will depend on the composition, characteristics, and credit quality of the loan and securities portfolios as well as the economic conditions at future reporting periods.

 Loans receivable: Loans receivable, net of related contra accounts, increased 1,041,253,000, or 8.1 , to 13,833,570,000 at September 30, 2021, from 12,792,317,000 one year earlier. The increase resulted primarily from originations of 8,184,733,000 and loan purchases of 488,147,000, partially offset by loan repayments of 6,797,043,000 and a 776,764,000 increase to loans-in-process during the year ended September 30, 2021. Commercial loan originations accounted for 77.1 of

 The contractual loan payment period for residential mortgage loans originated by the Company normally ranges from 15 to 30 years. Experience during recent years has indicated that, because of prepayments in connection with refinancing and sales of property, residential loans typically have a weighted average life of approximately five years.

 CARES Act and PPP Program : Pursuant to the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act CARES Act passed by Congress, the Company offered payment deferrals on consumer loans and commercial loans. The Company also made loans to small businesses through the Small Business Administration Paycheck Protection Program. For further information on these activities, see Note D to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.

 Interest receivable : Interest receivable was 50,636,000 as of September 30, 2021, a decrease of 3,163,000, or 5.9 , since September 30, 2020. The decrease was primarily a result of payments on previously deferred amounts on CARES Act loan modifications. 
 
 Bank Owned Life Insurance : Bank-owned life insurance increased to 233,263,000 as of September 30, 2021 from 227,749,000 as of September 30, 2020, primarily as a result of increases in the cash surrender value of the policies. The investments in bank-owned life insurance serve to assist in funding growing employee benefit costs. 
 Intangible assets : The Company's intangible assets totaled 310,019,000 at September 30, 2021 compared to 309,906,000 as of September 30, 2020. The balance at September 30, 2021 is comprised of 303,457,000 of goodwill and the unamortized balance of the core deposit and other intangibles of 6,562,000.

 Historically, a significant number of time deposit account holders roll over their balances into new time deposits of the same term at the Bank s then current rate. To ensure a continuity of this trend, the Bank expects to continue to offer market rates of interest. The ability to retain maturing time deposits is difficult to project; however, the Bank believes that by competitively pricing these certificates, levels deemed appropriate by management can be achieved on a continuing basis. 
 At September 30, 2021, the Bank had 607,245,000 of time deposits in amounts of 250,000 or more outstanding, maturing as follows: 200,127,000 within 3 months; 131,401,000 over 3 months through 6 months; 139,859,000 over 6 months through 12 months; and 135,858,000 thereafter. 
 Time deposits with a maturity of one year or less have penalties for premature withdrawal equal to 90 days of interest. When the maturity is greater than one year but less than four years, the penalty is 180 days of interest. When the maturity is 
 
 50 

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

 greater than four years, the penalty is 365 days of interest. Early withdrawal penalty fee income for the years ended 2021, 2020 and 2019 amounted to 198,000, 539,000 and 895,000, respectively. 
 For additional details on customer accounts, including uninsured deposits, see Note K to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report. 
 
 FHLB advances : FHLB advances declined to 1,720,000,000 as of September 30, 2021, as compared to 2,700,000,000 at September 30, 2020. Strong growth in customer deposits allowed the Company to reduce FHLB borrowings. Since September 30, 2020, cash flow hedges totaling 600,000,000 were terminated and the associated FHLB advances were paid off. An additional 150,000,000 of unhedged advances were repaid prior to maturity (resulting in a prepayment fee of 13,788,000) and the remaining 230,000,000 of unhedged borrowings were not renewed upon maturity. The weighted average rate for FHLB borrowings was 1.51 as of September 30, 2021, versus 1.79 at September 30, 2020, the decrease being primarily due to repayment of advances with higher rates. The Company has entered into interest rate swaps to hedge interest rate risk and convert certain FHLB advances to fixed rate payments. Taking into account these hedges, the weighted average effective maturity of FHLB advances at September 30, 2021 is 5.03 years.

 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 COMPARISON OF 2021 RESULTS WITH 2020 
 Net Income : Net income increased 10,177,000, or 5.9 , to 183,615,000 for the year ended September 30, 2021, as compared to 173,438,000 for the year ended September 30, 2020. The change was due to the factors described below. 
 Net Interest Income : For the year ended September 30, 2021, net interest income was 505,109,000, an increase of 35,601,000 or 7.6 from the year ended September 30, 2020. The increase in net interest income from the prior year was primarily due to average interest-earning assets increasing by 1,986,044,000 or 12.37 while average interest-bearing liabilities increased by 1,017,143,000 or 7.72 . During 2021, the average balance of loans receivable increased 943,212,000 or 7.7 , while the combined average balances of mortgage backed securities, other investment securities and cash increased by 1,054,758,000 or 28.9 . Average noninterest-bearing deposits grew by 809,741,000 over the same period. The change in net interest income was also impacted by the average rate earned on interest-earning assets declining by 58 basis points while the average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities declined by 54 basis points. 
 Rate/Volume Analysis 
 
 The table below sets forth certain information regarding changes in interest income and interest expense of the Company for the years indicated. For each category of interest-earning asset and interest-bearing liability, information is provided on changes attributable to: (1) changes in volume (changes in volume multiplied by old rate) and (2) changes in rate (changes in rate multiplied by old average volume). The change in interest income and interest expense attributable to changes in both volume and rate has been allocated proportionately to the change due to volume and the change due to rate.

 Provision (Release) for Credit Losses : The Company recorded a provision for credit losses of 500,000 in fiscal 2021, compared to provision of 21,750,000 in 2020. The significant provision in 2020 was due to higher expected losses with the onset of the global pandemic. In 2021, provisioning for net growth in the loan portfolio was mostly offset by releases related to improvements in macroeconomic variables used in the forecast component of the reserve. The Company had recoveries, net of

 charge-offs, of 6,345,000 for the year ended September 30, 2021, compared with 3,271,000 of net recoveries for the year ended September 30, 2020. 
 
 Other Income : Other income was 60,561,000 for the year ended September 30, 2021, a decrease of 26,399,000, or 30.4 , from 86,960,000 for the year ended September 30, 2020. The decrease is primarily due to the recognition of a net gain of 30,700,000 in 2020 from the sale and valuation adjustments of fixed assets, including a branch property in Bellevue, Washington. In 2021, a gain of 4,700,000 was recorded for equity investments based on updated valuations, a gain of 14,110,000 was recognized on the partial termination of an interest rate swap being used to hedge a FHLB borrowing, and these amounts were partially offset by a 13,788,000 loss on early repayment of a fixed-rate FHLB borrowing. 
 
 Other Expense : Operating expense was 332,459,000 for the year ended September 30, 2021, an increase of 16,901,000, or 5.4 , from the 315,558,000 for the year ended September 30, 2020. Compensation and benefits costs increased 28,510,000 or 19.3 year-over-year primarily due to annual merit increases, higher bonus compensation accruals related to strong deposit and loan growth, and strategic investments in top talent as well as contract staff to support strategic projects. Information technology costs decreased by 10,165,000 in 2021, as 2020 reflected larger investments in new hardware and software as well as a 5,900,000 impairment charge. In September 2021, the company recognized a 2,500,000 civil money penalty paid to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency OCC related to the previously-disclosed February 2018, Consent Order for Anti-Money Laundering and Bank Secrecy Act AML/BSA deficiencies. The Company s efficiency ratio was 58.8 for 2021 as compared to 56.7 for the prior year. The number of staff, including part-time employees on a full-time equivalent basis, was 2,082 and 2,080 at September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Total operating expense for the years ended September 30, 2021, and 2020 were 1.72 and 1.82 , respectively, of average assets. 
 
 Gain (Loss) on Real Estate Owned : Net gain on real estate owned was 427,000 for the year ended September 30, 2021, compared to a net gain of 26,000 for the year ended September 30, 2020. This amount includes ongoing maintenance expense, periodic valuation adjustments, and gains (losses) on sales of REO. 
 
 Income Tax Expense : Income tax expense was 49,523,000 for the year ended September 30, 2021, an increase of 3,775,000, or 8.3 , from the 45,748,000 for the year ended September 30, 2020. The increase is mostly due to a 6.4 increase in pre-tax income. The effective tax rate for 2021 was 21.24 as compared to 20.87 for the year ended September 30, 2020. The effective tax rate of 21.24 for 2021 differs from the statutory rate mainly due to the effects of state taxes, bank-owned life insurance, tax credit investments, tax-exempt loans to municipal entities and other qualified borrowers as well as adjustments to deferred tax items.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 
 The principal sources of funds for the Company's activities are loan repayments (including prepayments), net deposit inflows, borrowings, repayments and sales of investments and retained earnings, if applicable. The Company's principal sources of revenue are interest on loans and interest and dividends on investments. Additionally, the Company earns fee income for loan, deposit, insurance and other services. 
 On February 8, 2021, in connection with an underwritten public offering, the Company issued 300,000 shares of 4.875 Noncumulative Perpetual Series A Preferred Stock Series A Preferred Stock ). Net proceeds, after underwriting discounts and expenses, were 293,325,000. The public offering consisted of the issuance and sale of 12,000,000 depositary shares, each representing a 1/40th interest in a share of the Series A Preferred Stock, at a public offering price of 25.00 per depositary share. Holders of the depositary shares are entitled to all proportional rights and preferences of the Series A Preferred Stock (including dividend, voting, redemption and liquidation rights). The depositary shares are traded on the NASDAQ under the symbol "WAFDP." The Series A Preferred Stock is redeemable at the option of the Company, subject to all applicable regulatory approvals, on or after April 15, 2026. 
 The Company's shareholders' equity at September 30, 2021, was 2,126,064,000, or 10.82 of total assets, as compared to 2,014,133,000, or 10.72 of total assets, at September 30, 2020. The Company's shareholders' equity was impacted in the year by the February 8, 2021 issuance of Series A Preferred Stock and the receipt of net proceeds, after underwriting discounts and expenses of 293,325,000. Additionally, net income of 183,615,000, the payment of 65,876,000 in common stock dividends, payment of 6,378,000 in preferred stock dividends, 348,651,000 of treasury stock purchases, as well as other comprehensive income of 52,832,000 impacted shareholders' equity. The Company paid out 38.1 of its 2021 earnings in cash dividends to common shareholders, compared with 38.5 last year. For the year ended September 30, 2021, the Company returned 226 of net income to shareholders in the form of cash dividends and share repurchases as compared to 103 for the year ended September 30, 2020. Management believes the Company's strong net worth position allows it to manage balance sheet risk and provide the capital support needed for controlled growth in a regulated environment. Share repurchases were temporarily suspended during the COVID-19 pandemic but resumed in 2021. The Company s share repurchase program may be modified, suspended or terminated at any time, and the timing and amount of share repurchases is subject to market conditions and the market price of the Company s common stock, as well as other factors. 
 The Bank has a credit line with the Federal Home Loan Bank of Des Moines ("FHLB") up to 45 of total assets depending on specific collateral eligibility. This line provides a substantial source of additional liquidity if needed. Based on collateral pledged as of September 30, 2021, the Bank had 2,267,319,000 of additional borrowing capacity at the FHLB. 
 
 The Bank has entered into borrowing agreements with the FHLB to borrow funds under a short-term floating rate cash management advance program and fixed-rate term advance agreements. All borrowings are secured by stock of the FHLB, deposits with the FHLB, and a blanket pledge of qualifying loans receivable as provided in the agreements with the FHLB. The Bank is also eligible to borrow under the Federal Reserve Bank's primary credit program. 
 The Company's cash and cash equivalents were 2,090,809,000 at September 30, 2021, which is a 22.8 increase from the balance of 1,702,977,000 as of September 30, 2020. This increase was primarily due to the 1,762,488,000 increase in customer deposits, the majority of which was used to fund growth in the loan portfolio and paydown FHLB borrowings. See Changes in Financial Condition above and the Statement of Cash Flows included in the financial statements for additional details regarding this change.

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 

INTEREST RATE RISK 
 
 The primary source of income for the Company is net interest income, which is the difference between the interest income generated by interest-earning assets and the interest expense incurred for interest-bearing liabilities. The level of net interest income is a function of the average balance of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and the difference between the yield on earning assets and the cost of interest-bearing liabilities. Both the pricing and mix of the Company's interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities influence these factors. All else being equal, if the interest rates on the Company's interest-bearing liabilities increase at a faster pace than the interest rates on its interest-earning assets, the result would be a reduction in net interest income and with it, a reduction in net earnings. 
 
 Interest rate risk arises in part due to the Bank's significant holdings of fixed-rate single-family home loans, which are longer-term than customer accounts that constitute its primary liabilities. Accordingly, assets do not usually respond as quickly to changes in interest rates as liabilities. In the absence of management action, net interest income can be expected to decline when interest rates rise and to expand when interest rates fall. Shortening the maturity or repricing of the investment portfolio is one action that management can take. The composition of the investment portfolio was 56.2 variable rate and 43.8 fixed rate as of September 30, 2021 to provide some protection against rising rates. In addition, the Bank is producing more commercial loans that have shorter terms and/or variable rates and has increased less rate sensitive transaction deposit accounts to 77.9 of the deposit portfolio. 
 
 The Company's balance sheet strategy, in conjunction with low operating costs, has allowed the Company to manage interest rate risk, within guidelines established by the Board, through all interest rate cycles. It is management's objective to grow the dollar amount of net interest income, through the rate cycles, acknowledging that there will be some periods of time when that will not be feasible. Cash and cash equivalents of 2,090,809,000 and shareholders' equity of 2,126,064,000 provide management with flexibility in managing interest rate risk. Based on management's assessment of the current interest rate environment, the Company has taken steps, including growing commercial loans having shorter average lives and transaction deposit accounts, to position itself for changing interest rates. 
 
 Net Interest Income Sensitivity. We estimate the sensitivity of our net interest income to changes in market interest rates using an interest rate simulation model that includes assumptions related to the level of balance sheet growth, deposit repricing characteristics and the rate of prepayments for multiple interest rate change scenarios. Interest rate sensitivity depends on certain repricing characteristics in our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, including the maturity structure of assets and liabilities and their repricing characteristics during the periods of changes in market interest rates. The analysis presented below assumes a constant balance sheet. Actual results would differ from the assumptions used in this model, as management monitors and adjusts loan and deposit pricing and the size and composition of the balance sheet to respond to changing interest rates. 
 
 In the event of an immediate and parallel increase of 200 basis points in both short- and long-term interest rates, the model estimates that net interest income would increase by 9.7 in the next year. This compares to an estimated increase of 3.4 as of the September 30, 2020 analysis. It is noted that a flattening yield curve where the spread between short-term rates and long-term rates decreases would likely result in lower net interest income and vice versa for a steepening yield curve. Management estimates that a gradual increase of 300 basis points in short-term rates and 100 basis points in long-term rates over two years would result in a 1.1 increase in net interest income in the first year and an increase of 5.7 in the second year, assuming a constant balance sheet and no management intervention. 
 
 NPV Sensitivity. The NPV is an estimate of the market value of shareholders' equity at a point in time. It is derived by calculating the difference between the present value of expected cash flows from assets and the present value of expected cash flows from liabilities and off-balance-sheet contracts. The sensitivity of the NPV to changes in interest rates provides a longer term view of interest rate risk of the current balance sheet as it incorporates all future expected cash flows. As of September 30, 2021, in the event of an immediate and parallel increase of 200 basis points in interest rates, the NPV is estimated to decrease by 207,000,000, or 6.8 , and the NPV-to-total assets ratio to decline to 15.2 from a base of 15.5 . As of September 30, 2020, in the event of an immediate and parallel increase of 200 basis points in interest rates, the NPV was estimated to increase by 141,000,000, or 5.3 , and the NPV-to-total assets ratio to rise to 15.6 from a base of 14.1 . The change in the sensitivity of the NPV ratio to this assumed change in interest rates is primarily due to the steepening of the yield curve and changes in balance sheet mix year over year. 
 
 57 

Interest Rate Spread. The interest rate spread is measured as the difference between the rate on interest-earning assets and the rate on interest-bearing liabilities at the end of each period. The period end interest rate spread was 2.45 at September 30, 2021 and 2.34 at September 30, 2020. As of September 30, 2021, the weighted-average rate on interest-earning assets decreased by 23 basis points to 2.80 compared to September 30, 2020. The lower rate on interest-earning assets is due primarily to repayments on fixed rate loans with higher rates than newly originated loans, as well as prepayments of fixed rate mortgage-backed securities at higher rates, which resulted in asset balance mix shifting to lower yielding cash and investments. As of September 30, 2021, the weighted-average rate on interest-bearing liabilities decreased by 34 basis points to 0.35 compared to September 30, 2020. The lower rate on interest-bearing liabilities primarily resulted from a greater mix of lower rate transaction deposit accounts, time deposits repricing at lower rates and a lower rate on FHLB borrowings due to repayment of advances with higher rates. The period end interest rate spread for the last eight fiscal quarters is shown below: 
 
 SEP 2021 JUN 2021 MAR 2021 DEC 2020 SEP 2020 JUN 2020 MAR 2020 DEC 2019 Interest rate on loans and mortgage-backed securities 3.37 3.30 3.38 3.48 3.55 3.62 4.06 4.17 Interest rate on other interest-earning assets 0.53 0.58 0.54 0.64 0.63 0.73 0.76 2.00 Combined, all interest-earning assets 2.80 2.72 2.75 2.92 3.03 3.21 3.59 4.00 Interest rate on customer accounts 0.23 0.24 0.25 0.36 0.48 0.57 0.77 1.02 Interest rate on borrowings 1.51 1.74 1.84 1.82 1.79 1.49 1.37 2.46 Combined cost of funds 0.35 0.41 0.45 0.58 0.69 0.73 0.89 1.24 Interest rate spread 2.45 2.31 2.30 2.34 2.34 2.48 2.70 2.76 

The chart below shows the volatility of our period end net interest spread (dashed line measured against the right axis) compared to the relatively consistent growth in net interest income (solid line measured against the left axis). The relative consistency of net interest income is accomplished by actively managing the size and composition of the balance sheet through different rate cycles. 

Net Interest Margin. The net interest margin is measured using net interest income divided by average interest-earning assets for the period. The net interest margin decreased to 2.80 for the year ended September 30, 2021, from 2.93 for the year ended September 30, 2020. The yield on interest-earning assets decreased 58 basis points to 3.28 and the cost of interest- 
 
 58 

bearing liabilities decreased by 54 basis points to 0.61 . The lower yield on interest-earning assets is due primarily to repayments on fixed rate loans with higher rates than newly originated loans, as well as prepayments of fixed rate mortgage-backed securities at higher rates, which resulted in asset balance mix shifting to lower yielding cash and investments. The lower cost on interest-bearing liabilities primarily resulted from a greater mix of lower rate transaction deposit accounts, time deposits repricing at lower rates and a lower rate on FHLB borrowings due to repayment of advances with higher rates. 
 
 For the year ended September 30, 2021, average interest-earning assets increased by 12.4 to 18,036,174,000, up from 16,050,130,000 for the year ended September 30, 2020. The substantial balance sheet growth in 2021 was primarily due to the increase in customer deposits (noted below), which provided funding for growth in loans and other assets. During 2021, average loans receivable increased 943,212,000, or 7.7 , while the combined average balances of mortgage-backed securities, other investment securities and cash increased by 1,054,758,000 or 28.9 . Management views organic loan growth as the highest and best use of capital; thus the focus on primarily growing loans receivable. 
 
 During 2021, average interest-bearing customer deposit accounts increased 1,315,720,000 or 12.4 and the average balance of FHLB borrowings decreased by 298,569,000, or 11.8 , from 2020.

The following table shows the potential impact of rising interest rates on net income for one year. The Company's focus is primarily on the impact of rising rates generally, given the historically low current interest rate environment and the risk of abrupt upward or downward changes in short term rates. It is important to note that this is not a forecast or prediction of future events, but is used as a tool for measuring potential risk. This analysis assumes zero balance sheet growth and a constant percentage composition of assets and liabilities. 
 
 Potential Increase (Decrease) in Net Interest Income Basis Point Increase in Interest Rates September 30, 2021 September 30, 2020 (In thousands, except percentages) 100 24,612 4.76 7,931 1.82 200 50,065 9.67 14,742 3.38 300 72,721 14.05 18,445 4.23 
 
 Actual results will differ from the assumptions used in this model, as management monitors and adjusts both the size and the composition of the balance sheet in order to respond to changing interest rates. In a rising interest rate environment, it is likely that the Company will grow its balance sheet to offset margin compression that may occur. Improvement in the net interest income sensitivity during the year is primarily the result of interest rate swap activity and extension of the maturity of certain borrowings. 
 
 Another method used to quantify interest rate risk is the net portfolio value NPV analysis. This analysis calculates the difference between the present value of interest-bearing liabilities and the present value of expected cash flows from interest-earning assets and off-balance-sheet contracts. The following tables set forth an analysis of the Company s interest rate risk as measured by the estimated changes in NPV resulting from instantaneous and sustained parallel shifts in the yield curve (measured in 100-basis-point increments). 
 
 The tables below express the NPV under varying interest scenarios.

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of September 30, 2021, and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2021, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
 
 We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2021, based on the criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated November 19, 2021, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting. 
 
 Basis for Opinion 
 
 These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

Critical Audit Matter 
 
 The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. 
 
 Allowance for Credit Losses - Refer to Notes A and E to the financial statements 
 
 Critical Audit Matter Description 
 
 Estimates of expected credit losses under the current expected credit loss CECL methodology required under Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification No. 326, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (ASC 326) are based on relevant information about current conditions, past events, and reasonable and supportable forward-looking forecasts regarding collectability of the reported amounts. In order to estimate the expected credit losses for loans and unfunded loan commitments, the Company used either a cohort or weighted average remaining maturities WARM methodology to determine the historical loss rate, by loan portfolio class, then considered whether qualitative adjustments to those historical loss rates were warranted. As of September 30, 2021, the allowance for credit losses ACL was 171,300,000. 
 
 Significant management judgments are required in determining whether, and to what extent, qualitative adjustments for each portfolio loan class are required. These adjustments are made after considering the conditions over the period from which historical loss

experience was based and are split into two components: 1) asset or class specific risk characteristics or current conditions at the reporting date related to portfolio credit quality, remaining payments, volume and nature, credit culture and management, business environment or other management factors, not captured in the historical loss rates and 2) reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions and collateral values. 
 
 Given the significance of the ACL, reliance on historical loss rates and the management judgments required for quantitative and qualitative evaluation of past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amounts, performing audit procedures to evaluate the ACL requires a high degree of auditor judgment and increased extent of effort, including the need to involve our credit specialists. 
 
 How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit 
 
 Our audit procedures related to the ACL, included the following, among others: 
 
 We tested the effectiveness of management s controls over (1) key assumptions and judgments, (2) the CECL estimation model for loan portfolios, (3) the qualitative adjustments determined by management including the reasonable and supportable forecast adjustment selected by management, (4) and disclosures. 
 
 We evaluated the appropriateness of the Company s accounting policies, assumptions, and elections involved in the application of the CECL methodology. 
 
 We tested the underlying data and mathematical accuracy of the cohort and WARM methodologies used to determine the loan portfolio class historical loss rates. 
 
 We evaluated the reasonableness and conceptual soundness of the methodologies, as applied in the CECL estimation models, including key assumptions and judgments in estimating expected credit losses. 
 
 We evaluated the accuracy and completeness of the Company s disclosures in accordance with ASC 326. 
 
 Specific to the qualitative adjustments made to the historical loss rates: 
 - We assessed the appropriateness of the framework for the qualitative adjustments. 
 - We performed analysis to evaluate the relevance of each of the reasonable and supportable forecast assumptions to historic losses. 
 - We evaluated management s reasonable and supportable forecast of economic variables by comparing forecasts to relevant external market data. 
 - We assessed management s determination whether, and to what extent, a qualitative adjustment was warranted to certain loan portfolio classes to account for specific risk characteristics or current conditions that differ from the period over which the historical loss rate was determined.

 Basis of presentation and use of estimates. The Company s accounting and financial reporting policies conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP). Inter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the Company makes estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and revenues and expenses during the reporting periods and related disclosures. The areas that require application of significant management judgments often result in the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in future periods. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. Certain amounts in the financial statements from prior periods have been reclassified to conform to the current financial statement presentation. In certain instances, amounts in text are presented by rounding to the nearest thousand.

to bps for a specific term, usually six to months. Interest-only payments may also be approved during the modification period. Principal forgiveness is generally not an available option for restructured loans. Before granting approval to modify a loan in a TDR, the borrower s ability to repay is evaluated, including: current income levels and debt to income ratio, borrower s credit score, payment history of the loan and updated evaluation of the secondary repayment source. The Company also modifies some loans that are not classified as TDRs as the modification is due to a restructuring where the effective interest rate on the debt is reduced to reflect a decrease in market interest rates. The Company's ACL reflects the effects of a TDR when management reasonably expects at the reporting date that a TDR will be executed with an individual borrower. 
 
 Non-accrual loans. Loans are placed on nonaccrual status when, in the judgment of management, the probability of collection of interest is deemed to be insufficient to warrant further accrual. When a loan is placed on nonaccrual status, previously accrued but unpaid interest is deducted from interest income. The Company does not accrue interest on loans days or more past due. If payment is made on a loan so that the loan becomes less than 90 days past due, and the Company expects full collection of principal and interest, the loan is returned to full accrual status. Any interest ultimately collected is credited to income in the period of recovery. A loan is charged-off when the loss is estimable and it is confirmed that the borrower is not expected to be able to meet contractual obligations. 
 days delinquent. For commercial loans, consecutive payments on newly restructured loan terms are required prior to returning the loan to accrual status. In some instances, after the required consecutive payments are made, management will conclude that collection of the entire principal and interest due is still in doubt. In those instances, the loan will remain on non-accrual status. 
 We believe accrued interest receivable recorded as of September 30, 2021 is collectible.

During fiscal year 2020, as permitted in conjunction with the adoption of ASU 2019-04, the Company reclassified of prepayable debt securities from held-to-maturity to available-for-sale.

Substantially all of the Company s held-to-maturity debt securities are issued by U.S. government agencies or U.S. government-sponsored enterprises. These securities carry the explicit and/or implicit guarantee of the U.S. government and have a long history of zero credit loss. Therefore, the Company did not record an allowance for credit losses for these securities as of September 30, 2021 or September 30, 2020. 
 
 The Company does not believe that the available-for-sale debt securities that were in an unrealized loss position have any credit loss impairment as of September 30, 2021 or September 30, 2020. The Company does not intend to sell the investment securities that were in an unrealized loss position and it is not more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the investment securities before recovery of their amortized cost basis, which may be at maturity. Available-for-sale debt securities issued by U.S. government agencies or U.S. government-sponsored enterprises carry the explicit and/or implicit guarantee of the U.S. government and have a long history of zero credit loss. The issuers of the corporate debt securities and municipal bonds held are considered to be of high credit quality (rated AA or higher) and the decline in fair value is due to changes in interest rates and other market conditions. The issuers continue to make timely principal and interest payments on the bonds. The fair value is expected to recover as the bonds approach maturity.

 The Company has actively worked with its borrowers to modify consumer mortgage and commercial loans to provide payment deferrals as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The terms of the payment deferrals are generally 90 days for consumer mortgage loans and up to 180 days for commercial loans, and borrowers may be eligible for multiple deferrals. Pursuant to the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act CARES Act passed by Congress, these loan modifications are not accounted for as TDRs. In total, consumer loans and commercial loans were approved for deferrals. As of September 30, 2021, mortgage loans totaling and no commercial loans that had been modified remain in deferral. These loans are not considered past due until after the deferral period is over and scheduled payments have resumed. 
 The Company participated in the Small Business Administration s Paycheck Protection Program. This program came about through the CARES Act to help small businesses keep their employees employed through the COVID-19 shelter in place orders. In 2020, the Company assisted over businesses with more than in PPP loan originations. In 2021 we assisted over small businesses with in PPP loans. As of September 30, 2021, approximately PPP loans totaling have been forgiven by the SBA. 
 Most TDRs are accruing and performing loans where the borrower has proactively approached the Company about modifications due to temporary financial difficulties. Each request is individually evaluated for merit and likelihood of success. The concession for these loans is typically a payment reduction through a rate reduction of to bps for a specific term, usually six to months. Interest-only payments may also be approved during the modification period. Principal forgiveness is not an available option for restructured loans. As of September 30, 2021, the outstanding balance of TDRs was as compared to as of September 30, 2020. As of September 30, 2021, of the restructured loans were performing. Single-family residential loans comprised of TDRs as of September 30, 2021. The Company's ACL methodology takes into account the following performance indicators for restructured loans: 1) time since modification, 2) current payment status and 3) geographic area. 
 
 We evaluate the credit quality of our commercial loans based on regulatory risk ratings and also consider other factors. Based on this evaluation, the loans are assigned a grade and classified as follows:

The Company had recoveries, net of charge-offs, of for the year ended September 30, 2021, compared with of net recoveries for the year ended September 30, 2020.

 The Company has an asset quality review function that analyzes its loan portfolio and reports the results of the review to its Board of Directors on a quarterly basis. The single-family residential, HELOC and consumer portfolios are evaluated based on their performance as a pool of loans, since no single loan is individually significant or judged by its risk rating, size or potential risk of loss. The construction, land, multi-family, commercial real estate and commercial and industrial loans are risk rated on a loan by loan basis to determine the relative risk inherent in specific borrowers or loans. Based on that risk rating, the loans are assigned a grade and classified as described in Note D "Loans Receivable."

 Measured on a Nonrecurring Basis 
 
 Certain assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis after initial recognition such as collateral dependent loans and real estate owned ("REO"). REO consists principally of properties acquired through foreclosure. From time to time, and on a nonrecurring basis, adjustments using fair value measurements are recorded to reflect increases or decreases based on the discounted cash flows, the current appraisal or estimated value of the collateral or REO property. 
 
 When management determines that the fair value of the collateral or the REO requires additional adjustments, either as a result of an updated appraised value or when there is no observable market price, the Company classifies the collateral dependent loan or real estate owned as Level 3. Level 3 assets recorded at fair value on a nonrecurring basis includes loans for which an allowance was established or a partial charge-off was recorded based on the fair value of collateral, as well as real estate owned where the fair value of the property was less than the cost basis.

 Fair Values of Financial Instruments 
 
 U. S. GAAP requires disclosure of fair value information about financial instruments, whether or not recognized on the statement of financial condition, for which it is practicable to estimate those values. Certain financial instruments and all non-financial instruments are excluded from the disclosure requirements. Accordingly, the aggregate fair value estimates presented do not reflect the underlying fair value of the Company.

 The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of financial instruments: 
 Cash and cash equivalents The carrying amount of these items is a reasonable estimate of their fair value. 
 Available-for-sale securities and held-to-maturity securities Securities at fair value are primarily priced using model pricing based on the securities' relationship to other benchmark quoted prices as provided by an independent third party, and are considered a Level 2 input method. Equity securities which are exchange traded are considered a Level 1 input method. 
 Loans receivable Fair values are estimated first by stratifying the portfolios of loans with similar financial characteristics. Loans are segregated by type such as multi-family real estate, residential mortgage, construction, commercial, consumer and land loans. Each loan category is further segmented into fixed- and adjustable-rate interest terms. For residential mortgages and multi-family loans, the bank determined that its best exit price was by securitization. MBS benchmark prices are used as a base price, with further loan level pricing adjustments made based on individual loan characteristics such as FICO score, LTV, Property Type and occupancy. For all other loan categories an estimate of fair value is then calculated based on discounted cash flows using a discount

 The Company enters into interest rate swaps to hedge interest rate risk. These arrangements include hedges of individual fixed rate commercial loans and also hedges of a specified portion of pools of prepayable fixed rate mortgage loans under the "last of layer" method. These relationships qualify as fair value hedges under FASB ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging ("ASC 815"), which provides for offsetting of the recognition of gains and losses of the respective interest rate swap and the hedged items. Gains and losses on interest rate swaps designated in these hedge relationships, along with the offsetting gains and losses on the hedged items attributable to the hedged risk, are recognized in current earnings within the same income statement line item.

The Company has entered into interest rate swaps to convert certain short-term borrowings to fixed rate payments. The primary purpose of these hedges is to mitigate the risk of changes in future cash flows resulting from increasing interest rates. For qualifying cash flow hedges under ASC 815, gains and losses on the interest rate swaps are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income ("AOCI") and then reclassified into earnings in the same period the hedged cash flows affect earnings and within the same income statement line item as the hedged cash flows. As of September 30, 2021, the maturities for hedges of adjustable rate borrowings ranged from less than to , with the weighted average being years.

 The Company periodically enters into certain interest rate swap agreements in order to provide commercial loan customers the ability to convert from variable to fixed interest rate payments, while the Company retains a variable rate loan. Under these agreements, the Company enters into a variable rate loan agreement and a swap agreement with the client. The swap agreement effectively converts the client s variable rate loan into a fixed rate. The Company enters into a corresponding swap agreement with a third party in order to offset its exposure on the variable and fixed components of the client's swap agreement. The interest rate swaps are derivatives under ASC 815, with changes in fair value recorded in earnings. There was net impact to the statement of operations for the years ended September 30, 2021 and 2020 as the changes in fair value of the receive fixed swap and pay fixed swap offset each other.

As this standard is immaterial to our consolidated financial statements, the Company has omitted certain disclosures in ASC 606, including the disaggregation of revenue table. Sources of noninterest income within the scope of the new guidance include the following: 
 
 Deposit related and other service charges (recognized in Deposit Fee Income) : The Company's deposit accounts are governed by standardized contracts customary in the industry. Revenues are earned at a point in time or over time (monthly) from account maintenance fees and charges for specific transactions such as wire transfers, stop payment orders, overdrafts, debit card replacements, check orders and cashiers' checks. The Company s performance obligation related to each of these fees is generally satisfied, and the related revenue recognized, at the time the service is provided (point in time or monthly). The Company is principal in each of these contracts. 
 
 Debit and credit card interchange fees (recognized in Deposit Fee Income) : The Company receives interchange fees from the debit card and credit card payment networks based on transactions involving debit or credit cards issued by the Company, generally measured as a percentage of the underlying transaction. Interchange fees from debit and credit card transactions are recognized as the transaction processing services are provided by the network. The Company acts as an agent in the card payment network arrangement so the interchange fees are recorded net of any expenses paid to the principal (the card payment networks in this case).

 Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
 The Company's management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. The Company s internal control system is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting practices in the United States of America. 
 
 The Company s management assessed the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2021. In making the assessment, the Company s management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in the 2013 version of its Internal Control-Integrated Framework. Based on its assessment, the Company s management believes that as of September 30, 2021, the Company s internal control over financial reporting was effective based on this criteria. 
 
 The Company s independent auditors, Deloitte Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, have issued an audit report on the Company s internal control over financial reporting, which appears in this annual report on Form 10-K. 
 There have been no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting during the Company s most recent fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2021 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting. 

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
 To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of 
 Washington Federal, Inc. 
 Seattle, Washington 
 
 Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Washington Federal, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company as of September 30, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Because management s assessment and our audit were conducted to meet the reporting requirements of Section 112 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act (FDICIA), management s assessment and our audit of the Company s internal control over financial reporting included controls over the preparation of the schedules equivalent to the basic financial statements in accordance with the instructions for the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency Instructions for Call Reports for Balance Sheet on schedule RC, Income Statement on schedule RI, and Changes in Bank Equity Capital on schedule RI-A. In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO. 
 
 We have not examined and, accordingly, we do not express an opinion or any other form of assurance on management's statement referring to compliance with laws and regulations. 
 
 We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended September 30, 2021, of the Company and our report dated November 19, 2021, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements. 
 
 Basis for Opinion 
 
 The Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 
 We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 
 Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Exhibit 4.1 DESCRIPTION OF CAPITAL STOCK OF REGISTRANT REGISTERED PURSUANT TO SECTION 12 OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934 The following summary of Washington Federal, Inc. s capital stock is based on and qualified by our Restated Articles of Incorporation, as amended Articles and our Amended and Restated Bylaws Bylaws ). For a complete description of the terms and provisions of our capital stock, including our common stock and preferred stock, please refer to our Articles, which are filed as an exhibit to this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our Bylaws, which are incorporated by reference as an exhibit to this Annual Report on Form 10-K of which this Exhibit 4.1 is a part, and the applicable provisions of the Washington Business Corporation Act, Title 23B of the Revised Code of Washington. Our Articles authorize the issuance of up to 300,000,000 shares of common stock, par value 1.00 per share Common Stock and 5,000,000 shares of serial preferred stock, 1.00 par value per share (the Preferred Stock ), of which 300,000 shares, 1.00 par value per share, have been designated as 4.875 Fixed Rate Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series A (the Series A Preferred Stock ). The rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions of the remaining undesignated preferred stock may be established from time to time by our board of directors. Common Stock All outstanding shares of our common stock are fully paid and nonassessable. Voting Rights: Each holder of common stock is entitled to one vote for each share held on all matters to be voted upon by the shareholders, other than the election of directors. At each election of directors every shareholder entitled to vote has the right to vote, in person or by proxy, the number of shares owned by him or her for as many persons as there are directors to be elected. A shareholder may also cumulate his or her votes by giving one candidate as many votes as the number of such directors to be elected multiplied by the number of his or her shares shall equal, or by distributing such votes on the same principle among any number of candidates. Dividend Rights: Holders of common stock are entitled to receive ratably the dividends, if any, that are declared from time to time by the board of directors out of funds legally available for that purpose. If we do not or are unable to pay quarterly dividends on our Series A Preferred Stock, we may not pay a dividend to the holders of our common stock. Liquidation Rights: In the event of a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of our company, after payment of the liquidation preference to any holder of Series A Preferred Stock, the holders of common stock are entitled to share in our assets remaining after the payment of liabilities. Repurchase or Redemption Restrictions. So long as any Series A Preferred Stock is outstanding, unless full dividends for the preceding quarter have been paid in full (or declared and a sum sufficient for the dividend set aside for payment), no shares of common stock may be repurchased or redeemed or otherwise acquired for consideration by the corporation, nor may any funds be paid to or made available for a sinking fund for the redemption of any shares of common stock (other than for 

Exhibit 4.1 purchases, redemptions or repurchases in connection with any employment contract, benefit plan or other similar arrangement for the benefit of employees, officers directors or consultants). Other Rights. Holders of common stock have no preemptive or subscription rights to subscribe for additional shares of our capital stock. Holders of our common stock have no conversion or exchange rights. Holders of common stock may act by unanimous written consent. The rights, preferences and privileges of the holders of common stock are subject to, and may be adversely affected by, the rights of holders of shares of any series of preferred stock, including the Series A Preferred Stock. Listing: Our common stock trades on the Nasdaq Stock Market under the symbol WAFD . Series A Preferred Stock On February 8, 2021 we issued and sold 12,000,000 depositary shares, each representing a 1/40th ownership interest in a share of Series A Preferred Stock, representing a total of 300,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock. Ranking: Shares of Series A Preferred Stock rank: (1) senior to our common stock with respect to the payment of dividends and distributions of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up; (2) junior to any of our existing and future indebtedness; and (3) at least equally with each other series of preferred stock we may issue if provided for in the certificate of designations relating to such preferred stock or otherwise (except for any senior stock that may be issued with the requisite consent of the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock and all other parity stock, if any). Voting Rights: Except as indicated below, the holders of Series A Preferred Stock have no voting rights. If we fail to pay, or declare and set apart for payment, dividends on outstanding shares of the Series A Preferred Stock for six quarterly dividend periods, whether or not consecutive (a Nonpayment Event ), the number of directors on our Board of Directors shall automatically be increased by two. The holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall have the right, together with holders of any other equally ranked series of preferred stock that have similar voting rights, if any Voting Parity Stock ), voting together as a single class in proportion to their respective liquidation preferences, by a plurality of the votes cast, to elect two additional members of our Board of Directors (the Preferred Stock Directors to fill such newly created directorships. Our Board of Directors shall at no time include more than two Preferred Stock Directors, including all directors that the holders of any series of Voting Parity Stock are entitled to elect pursuant to voting rights. In the event that the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock and any Voting Parity Stock shall be entitled to vote for the election of Preferred Stock Directors following a Nonpayment Event, such directors shall be initially elected at a special meeting called at the request of record holders owning shares representing at least 20 of the combined liquidation preference of all shares of Series A Preferred 

Exhibit 4.1 Stock and each series of Voting Parity Stock then outstanding, voting together as a single class in proportion to their respective liquidation preferences and subsequently at each annual meeting of our shareholders. The Preferred Stock Directors elected at any such special meeting will hold office until the next annual meeting of our shareholders if such office shall not have been previously terminated as below provided. The holders of Series A Preferred Stock will not have the right to cumulate votes for the Preferred Stock Directors. When dividends have been paid in full on the Series A Preferred Stock for at least four consecutive quarterly dividend periods, then the right of the holders of Preferred Stock to elect the Preferred Stock Directors shall terminate (but will revest upon the occurrence of any future Nonpayment Event), and, if and when any rights of holders of the Preferred Stock and Voting Parity Stock to elect Preferred Stock Directors have terminated, the terms of office of all Preferred Stock Directors will immediately terminate and the number of directors shall automatically be reduced accordingly. Under regulations adopted by the Federal Reserve, if the holders of any series of preferred stock are or become entitled to vote separately for the election of directors as a class, such series, along with any other holders of stock that are entitled to vote for the election of directors with that series, will be deemed a class of voting securities. A company holding 25 or more of that class, or less if it otherwise has the power to directly or indirectly exercise a controlling influence over our management or policies, will be required to obtain the prior approval of the Federal Reserve and be subject to regulation as a bank holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 (the BHC Act ). In addition, at the time the series is deemed a class of voting securities, any other bank holding company will be required to obtain the prior approval of the Federal Reserve under the BHC Act to acquire or retain more than 5 of that class. Any other person (other than a bank holding company) will generally be required to obtain the non-objection of the Federal Reserve under the Change in Bank Control Act of 1978, as amended, to acquire or retain 10 or more of that class. So long as any shares of Series A Preferred Stock remain outstanding, the affirmative vote or consent of the holders of at least two-thirds of all outstanding shares of the Series A Preferred Stock, voting separately as a class, shall be required to: (1) authorize or increase the authorized amount of, or issue shares of, any class or series of senior stock, or issue any obligation or security convertible into or evidencing the right to purchase any such shares; (2) amend the provisions of our Restated Articles of Incorporation (including the certificate of designations creating the Series A Preferred Stock) so as to adversely affect the powers, preferences, privileges or rights of the Series A Preferred Stock, taken as a whole; provided, however, that any increase in the amount of the authorized or issued Series A Preferred Stock or authorized common stock or preferred stock or the creation and issuance, or an increase in the authorized or issued amount, of other series of preferred stock ranking equally with or junior to the Series A Preferred Stock with respect to the payment of dividends (whether such dividends are cumulative or non-cumulative) or the distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of Washington Federal will not be deemed to adversely affect the powers, preferences, privileges or rights of the Series A Preferred Stock; or (3) consummate a binding share-exchange or reclassification involving the Series A Preferred Stock, or a merger or our consolidation with or into another entity unless (i) the 

Exhibit 4.1 shares of the Series A Preferred Stock remain outstanding or, in the case of any such merger or consolidation with respect to which Washington Federal is not the surviving or resulting entity, are converted into or exchanged for preference securities of the new surviving or resulting entity and (ii) the shares of the remaining Series A Preferred Stock or new preferred securities have such rights, preferences, privileges and voting powers, and limitations and restrictions thereof, that are not materially less favorable to the holders thereof than the rights, preferences, privileges and voting powers of the Series A Preferred Stock. The foregoing voting provisions will not apply if, at or prior to the time when the act with respect to which such vote would otherwise be required shall be effected, all outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall have been redeemed. Washington law provides that the holders of preferred stock will have the right to vote separately as a class on any amendment to our Restated Articles of Incorporation that would increase the aggregate number of authorized shares of such class, effect an exchange or reclassification of the preferred shares into another class or series, or alter or change the rights, preferences, or limitations of the shares of such class, so as to affect them adversely. If any such proposed amendment would alter or change the rights, preferences or limitations of one or more series of preferred stock so as to affect them adversely, but would not so affect the entire class of preferred stock, only the shares of the series so affected shall be considered a separate class for purposes of this vote on the amendment. This right is in addition to any voting rights that may be provided for in our Restated Articles of Incorporation. Dividend Rights. Dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock will not be cumulative or mandatory. Holders of Series A Preferred Stock will be entitled to receive, when, as, and if declared by our Board of Directors or a duly authorized committee of our Board of Directors, out of assets legally available for the payment of dividends under Washington law, non-cumulative cash dividends based on the liquidation preference of the Series A Preferred Stock at a rate equal to 4.875 per annum for each quarterly dividend period from the original issue date of the depositary shares through the redemption date of the Series A Preferred Stock, if any. If declared by the Board or a duly authorized committee of the Board, dividends will be payable on the Series A Preferred Stock quarterly in arrears, on January 15, April 15, July 15 and October 15 of each year. Liquidation Rights. In the event we liquidate, dissolve or wind-up our business and affairs, either voluntarily or involuntarily, holders of the Series A Preferred Stock are entitled to receive a liquidating distribution of 1,000 per share (equivalent to 25 per depositary share), plus any declared and unpaid dividends, without accumulation of any undeclared dividends, before we make any distribution of assets to the holders of our common stock or any other class or series of shares ranking junior to the Series A Preferred Stock. Holders of the Series A Preferred Stock will not be entitled to any other amounts from us after they have received their full liquidating distribution. Redemption Rights. The Series A Preferred Stock is redeemable at the option of the corporation after April 15, 2026 at a redemption price equal to 1,000 per share (equivalent to 25 per depositary share), plus any declared and unpaid dividends for prior dividend periods and accrued but unpaid dividends (whether or not declared) for the then-current dividend period to, but excluding, the redemption date. Neither the holders of Series A Preferred Stock nor holders of depositary shares will have the right to require the redemption or repurchase of the Series A Preferred Stock. 

Exhibit 4.1 Preemptive and Conversion Rights. The holders of the Series A Preferred Stock do not have any preemptive or conversion rights. Maturity. The Series A Preferred Stock is perpetual and has no maturity date. Depositary Share Listing. The Depositary Shares, each representing a 1/40th interest in a share of Series A Preferred Stock, trades on the Nasdaq Stock Market under symbol WAFDP. American Stock Transfer Trust Company, LLC is the depositary and transfer agent and registrar for the Series A Preferred Stock. Effect of Certain Provisions of our Articles and Bylaws and the Washington Anti-Takeover Statute Provisions of our Restated Articles of Incorporation, as amended, and Amended and Restated Bylaws may have the effect of deterring or delaying attempts by our shareholders to remove or replace management, to commence proxy contests, or to effect changes in control. These provisions include: our board of directors is classified into three classes of directors; procedures for advance notification of shareholder nominations and proposals; the ability of our board of directors to amend our bylaws without shareholder approval; and the ability of our board of directors to issue up to 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock without shareholder approval upon the terms and conditions and with the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions that the board of directors may determine. In addition, as a Washington corporation, we are subject to Chapter 23B.19 of the Washington Business Corporation Act, which imposes restrictions on certain transactions between a corporation and certain significant shareholders. These provisions, alone or together, could have the effect of deterring or delaying changes in our incumbent management, proxy contests or changes in control.
