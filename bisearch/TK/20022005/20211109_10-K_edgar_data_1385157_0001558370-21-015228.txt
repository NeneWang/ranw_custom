Our broad range of connectivity and sensor solutions, proven in the harshest environments, enable advancements in transportation, industrial applications, medical technology, energy, data communications, and the home. We became an independent, publicly traded company in 2007; however, through our predecessor companies, we trace our foundations in the connectivity business back to 1941. We are organized under the laws of Switzerland. The rights of holders of our shares are governed by Swiss law, our Swiss articles of association, and our Swiss organizational regulations. We have a 52- or 53-week fiscal year that ends on the last Friday of September. Fiscal 2021, 2020, and 2019 were each 52 weeks in length and ended on September 24, 2021, September 25, 2020, and September 27, 2019, respectively. For fiscal years in which there are 53 weeks, the fourth fiscal quarter includes 14 weeks, with the next such occurrence taking place in fiscal 2022. COVID-19 Pandemic A novel strain of coronavirus COVID-19 was first identified in China in December 2019 and subsequently declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization. COVID-19 has surfaced in nearly all regions around the world and resulted in business slowdowns or shutdowns and travel restrictions in affected areas. The pandemic had a significant, negative impact on our sales and operating results during fiscal 2020 and continued to negatively affect certain of our businesses in fiscal 2021. See Part II. Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for discussion regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our financial results. Also, see Part I. Item 1A. Risk Factors for discussion of the risks and uncertainties associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. Segments We operate through three reportable segments: Transportation Solutions, Industrial Solutions, and Communications Solutions. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, our three segments served a combined market of approximately 190 billion. Although COVID-19 negatively affected our markets in fiscal 2020, certain of our markets experienced recovery in fiscal 2021. We expect this recovery will continue and our three segments will once again serve a combined market of approximately 190 billion in future periods. Our net sales by segment as a percentage of our total net sales were as follows: 

Fiscal 2021 2020 2019 Transportation Solutions 60 56 58 Industrial Solutions 26 31 30 Communications Solutions 14 13 12 Total 100 100 100 Below is a description of our reportable segments and the primary products, markets, and competitors of each segment.

Customers As an industry leader, we have established close working relationships with many of our customers. These relationships allow us to better anticipate and respond to customer needs when designing new products and new technical solutions. By working with our customers in developing new products and technologies, we believe we can identify and act on trends and leverage knowledge about next-generation technology across our products. Our approach to our customers is driven by our dedication to further develop our product families and ensure that we are globally positioned to best provide our customers with sales and engineering support. We believe that as electronic component technologies continue to proliferate, our broad product portfolio and engineering capability give us a potential competitive advantage when addressing the needs of our global customers. We manufacture and sell a broad portfolio of products to customers in various industries. Our customers include many of the leaders in their respective industries, and our relationships with them typically date back many years. We believe that our diversified customer base provides us an opportunity to leverage our skills and experience across markets and reduce our exposure to individual end markets, thereby reducing the variability of our financial performance. Additionally, we believe that the diversity of our customer base reduces the level of cyclicality in our results and distinguishes us from our competitors. No single customer accounted for a significant amount of our net sales in fiscal 2021, 2020, or 2019. Sales and Distribution We maintain a strong local presence in each of the geographic regions in which we operate. Our net sales by geographic region (1) as a percentage of our total net sales were as follows: 

Fiscal 2021 2020 2019 Europe/Middle East/Africa EMEA 37 35 36 Asia Pacific 36 35 33 Americas 27 30 31 Total 100 100 100 

 (1) Net sales to external customers are attributed to individual countries based on the legal entity that records the sale.

Table of Contents 
 We sell our products into approximately 140 countries primarily through direct selling efforts to manufacturers. In fiscal 2021, our direct sales represented approximately 80 of total net sales. We also sell our products indirectly via third-party distributors. We maintain distribution centers around the world. Products are generally delivered to the distribution centers by our manufacturing facilities and then subsequently delivered to the customer. In some instances, however, products are delivered directly from our manufacturing facility to the customer. Our global coverage positions us near our customers locations and allows us to assist them in consolidating their supply base and lowering their production costs. We contract with a wide range of transport providers to deliver our products globally via road, rail, sea, and air. We believe our balanced sales distribution lowers our exposure to any particular geography and improves our financial profile. Seasonality and Backlog Typically, we experience a slight seasonal pattern to our business. Overall, the third and fourth fiscal quarters are usually the strongest quarters of our fiscal year, whereas the first fiscal quarter is negatively affected by holidays and the second fiscal quarter may be affected by adverse winter weather conditions in some of our markets. Certain of our end markets experience some seasonality. Our sales in the automotive market are dependent upon global automotive production, and seasonal declines in European production may negatively impact net sales in the fourth fiscal quarter. Also, our sales in the energy market typically increase in the third and fourth fiscal quarters as customer activity increases. Customer orders and demand may fluctuate as a result of economic and market conditions, including the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Backlog by reportable segment was as follows: 

Fiscal Year End 2021 2020 (in millions) Transportation Solutions 3,014 1,819 Industrial Solutions 1,851 1,260 Communications Solutions 976 439 Total 5,841 3,518 We expect that the majority of our backlog at fiscal year end 2021 will be filled during fiscal 2022. Backlog is not necessarily indicative of future net sales as unfilled orders may be cancelled prior to shipment of goods. Competition The industries in which we operate are highly competitive, and we compete with thousands of companies that range from large multinational corporations to local manufacturers. Competition is generally based on breadth of product offering, product innovation, price, quality, delivery, and service. We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, downward pressure on prices. However, as a result of increased costs, certain of our businesses implemented price increases in fiscal 2021. Raw Materials We use a wide variety of raw materials in the manufacture of our products. The principal raw materials that we use include plastic resins for molding; precious metals such as gold and silver for plating; and other metals such as copper, aluminum, brass, and steel for manufacturing cable, contacts, and other parts that are used for cable and component bodies and inserts. Many of these raw materials are produced in a limited number of countries around the world or are only available from a limited number of suppliers. The prices of these materials are driven by global supply and demand. As markets recover from the COVID-19 pandemic, increases in consumer demand have led to shortages and price increases in some of our input materials.

 Intellectual Property Patents and other proprietary rights are important to our business. We also rely upon trade secrets, manufacturing know-how, continuing technological innovations, and licensing opportunities to maintain and improve our competitive position. We review third-party proprietary rights, including patents and patent applications, as available, in an effort to develop an effective intellectual property strategy, avoid infringement of third-party proprietary rights, identify licensing opportunities, and monitor the intellectual property claims of others. We own a large portfolio of patents that relate principally to electrical, optical, and electronic products. We also own a portfolio of trademarks and are a licensee of various patents and trademarks. Patents for individual products extend for varying periods according to the date of patent filing or grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained. Trademark rights may potentially extend for longer periods of time and are dependent upon national laws and use of the trademarks. While we consider our patents and trademarks to be valued assets, we do not believe that our competitive position or our operations are dependent upon or would be materially impacted by any single patent or group of related patents. Human Capital Management We have employees located throughout the world. As of fiscal year end 2021, we employed approximately 89,000 people worldwide, including contract employees. Approximately 37,000 were in the EMEA region, 24,000 were in the Asia Pacific region, and 28,000 were in the Americas region. Of our total employees, approximately 56,000 were employed in manufacturing. Our strong employee base, along with their commitment to uncompromising values, provides the foundation of our company s success. Our core values integrity, accountability, teamwork, and innovation govern us. They guide our decisions and our actions, both individually and as an organization. Additionally, our employees are responsible for upholding our purpose to create a safer, sustainable, productive, and connected future. We track and report internally on key talent metrics including workforce demographics, critical role pipeline data, diversity data, and engagement and inclusion indices. We aspire to have more than 26 women in leadership roles by fiscal 2025 and are committed to increasing the total number of women across all levels of the organization. Additionally, as part of its charter, the management development and compensation committee of our board of directors oversees our policies and practices related to the management of human capital resources including talent management, culture, diversity, and inclusion. We embrace diversity and inclusion. A truly innovative workforce needs to be diverse and leverage the skills and perspectives of a wealth of backgrounds and experiences. To drive our business outcomes globally, we believe we must build a workforce and supplier network that represents our global markets and the customers we serve. We are also committed to a work environment where all employees are engaged, feel differences are valued and mutually-respected, and believe that all opinions count. Our people reflect our customers and markets. Our employees are in over 50 countries representing approximately 120 nationalities, and our total employee population is over 40 women. Our employee resource groups ERGs are company-sponsored, voluntary, employee-led groups that focus on diverse talent segments or shared experiences of employees. These groups apply those perspectives to create value for our company as a whole. The ERGs provide a space where employees can foster connections and develop in a supportive environment. As of fiscal year end 2021, we had eight ERGs ALIGN (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer/questioning employees and their allies), Women in Networking, TE Young Professionals, African Heritage, Asian Heritage, Latin Heritage, THRIVE (employees and their allies with mixed mental, emotional, and physical abilities), and TE Veterans. Our ERGs have a total of over 6,000 members. During fiscal 2021, we conducted our second consecutive employee engagement survey which was a fully digital, enterprise-wide survey available in 15 languages and focused on measuring engagement, inclusion, and leadership effectiveness. We had a participation rate of over 80 in fiscal 2021. Both our participation rate and engagement score improved in fiscal 2021 while our inclusion score remained consistent with fiscal 2020. Fiscal 2021 was the first year leadership effectiveness was measured as part of this survey. Additionally, our survey results for fiscal 2021 were favorable when compared to Glint Inc. s external global manufacturing benchmark . By fiscal 2025, we aspire to be in the top tier of this benchmark on engagement and inclusion. We continue to emphasize employee development and training to support engagement and retention. To empower employees to unleash their potential, we provide a range of development programs and opportunities, skills, and resources

 they need to be successful. Our LEARN@TE platform supplements our talent development strategies. It is an online portal that enables employees to access instructor-led classroom or virtual courses and self-directed web-based courses. Strategy, execution, and talent SET leadership expectations, which focus on how we drive strategy, effectively execute, and build talent, have been rolled out to all employees and are embedded in all of our leadership programs. We integrate these behavioral expectations into the way we assess and select talent, manage performance, and develop and reward our people. We are committed to identifying and developing our next generation of leaders. We have a robust talent and succession planning process and have established specialized programs to support the development of our talent pipeline for critical roles in general management, engineering, and operations, as well as the diversity of our talent. We are focused on both the recruitment of diverse candidates and the development of our diverse employees to provide the opportunity to advance their careers and move into leadership positions within the company. On an annual basis, we conduct an organization and leadership review process with our chief executive officer and all segment, business unit, and function leaders focusing on our high-performing and high-potential talent, diverse talent, and the succession for our most critical roles. Also, our board of directors reviews and assesses management development plans for senior executives and the succession plans relating to those positions. We are committed to the safety, health, human rights, and well-being of our employees. We continuously evaluate opportunities to raise safety and health standards through our environmental, health, and safety team. Compliance audits and internal processes are in place to stay ahead of workplace hazards, and we aim to reduce our Occupational Safety and Health Administration OSHA total recordable incident rate a rate equivalent to the number of incidents per 100 employees or 200,000 work hours to 0.12 by fiscal 2025. During the COVID-19 pandemic, we have taken additional actions to protect the physical and mental health and well-being of our global employees. We have utilized our workplace flexibility guidelines, promoted our Wellbeing Connection program and health care benefits to support the needs of all employees, and instituted additional safety measures at all factories and sites. In fiscal 2021, we implemented a human rights policy for the organization outlining our commitment to operating with respect for human rights. We believe our management team has the experience necessary to effectively execute our strategy and advance our product and technology leadership. Our chief executive officer and segment leaders average over 25 years of industry experience. They are supported by an experienced and talented management team who is dedicated to maintaining and expanding our position as a global leader in the industry. For discussion of the risks relating to the attraction and retention of management and executive management employees, see Part 1. Item 1A. Risk Factors. Government Regulation and Supervision The import and export of products are subject to regulation by the various jurisdictions where we conduct business. A small portion of our products, including defense-related products, may require governmental import and export licenses, whose issuance may be influenced by geopolitical and other events. We have a trade compliance organization and other systems in place to apply for licenses and otherwise comply with such regulations. Any failure to maintain compliance with domestic and foreign trade regulation could limit our ability to import and export raw materials and finished goods into or from the relevant jurisdiction. See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding trade compliance matters. Also, see Part I. Item 1A. Risk Factors for discussion of the risks and uncertainties associated with trade regulations. Environmental Our operations are subject to numerous environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations, including those regulating the discharge of materials into the environment, greenhouse gas emissions, hazardous materials in products, and chemical usage. We are committed to complying with these laws and to the protection of our employees and the environment. We maintain a global environmental, health, and safety program that includes appropriate policies and standards; staff dedicated to environmental, health, and safety issues; periodic compliance auditing; training; and other measures. We also have a program for compliance with the European Union EU Restriction of Hazardous Substances and Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directives, the China Administrative Measures for the Restriction of Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Products, the EU Registration, Evaluation, Authorization, and Restriction of Chemicals REACH Regulation, and similar laws. Compliance with these laws has increased our costs of doing business in a variety of ways and may continue to do so in the future. For example, laws regarding product content and chemical registration require extensive and costly data

 collection, management, and reporting, and laws regulating greenhouse gas emissions may increase our costs for energy and certain materials and products. We also have projects underway at a number of current and former manufacturing sites to investigate and remediate environmental contamination resulting from past operations. Based upon our experience, available information, and applicable laws, as of fiscal year end 2021, we concluded that we would incur investigation and remediation costs at these sites in the reasonably possible range of 18 million to 47 million, and we accrued 21 million as the probable loss, which was the best estimate within this range. We do not anticipate any material capital expenditures during fiscal 2022 for environmental control facilities or other costs of compliance with laws or regulations relating to greenhouse gas emissions. Sustainability We look to build on our strong foundation of environmental sustainability in our operations. Our environmental sustainability strategy guides how we balance investor and customer expectations and drive improved environmental sustainability. Our sustainability initiatives in our operations began more than 10 years ago. From fiscal 2010 to 2020, we achieved more than a 25 reduction in absolute energy usage, absolute greenhouse gas emissions (Scopes 1 and 2), and absolute water usage. Over the last few years, we have recycled approximately 80 of the waste materials from our operations. We have challenged ourselves to find new ways to continue to drive sustainability improvements. In fiscal 2021, we: established a new goal to further reduce our greenhouse gas emissions from our operations by more than 40 , on an absolute basis, by fiscal 2030 and made measurable progress towards this goal; improved our energy efficiency through energy efficient solutions such as implementing operating standards and advancing our equipment infrastructure (for example, LED lighting, compressor controls, and HVAC); and reported our Scope 3 emissions to CDP for the first time. 
 While sustainability is embedded in our operations, we are exploring opportunities with our direct suppliers and logistics service providers to strengthen the environmental sustainability of our supply chain. The majority of our greenhouse gas emissions are from the goods and services we use in our operations. In addition to improving the sustainability of our operations and working with our suppliers to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions, we help our customers produce smaller, lighter, and more energy-efficient products, reducing the environmental impact of the products our customers make through the life of their products. With every product that comes out of our facilities, we support a safer, sustainable, productive, and connected future.

 ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS Investors should carefully consider the risks described below before investing in our securities. These risks are not the only ones facing us. Our business is also subject to general risks that affect many other companies. Additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may also impair our business operations, financial condition, and liquidity . Risks Relating to the Macroeconomic Environment and Our Global Presence Conditions in global or regional economies, capital and money markets, and banking systems, and cyclical industry demand may adversely affect our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows. Our business and operating results have been and will continue to be affected by economic conditions regionally or globally, including the cost and availability of consumer and business credit, end demand from consumer and industrial markets, and concerns as to sovereign debt levels including credit rating downgrades and defaults on sovereign debt and significant bank failures or defaults. Any of these economic factors could cause our customers to experience deterioration of their businesses, cash flow, and ability to obtain financing. As a result, existing or potential customers may delay or cancel plans to purchase our products and may not be able to fulfill their obligations to us in a timely fashion or in full. Further, our vendors may experience similar problems, which may impact their ability to fulfill our orders or meet agreed service and quality levels. If regional or global economic conditions deteriorate, our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows could be materially adversely affected. Also, deterioration in economic conditions, expectations for future revenue, projected future cash flows, or other factors have triggered and could trigger additional recognition of impairment charges for our goodwill or other long-lived assets. Impairment charges, if any, may be material to our results of operations and financial position. Foreign currency exchange rates may adversely affect our results. Our Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in United States U.S. dollars; however, a significant portion of our business is conducted outside the U.S. Changes in the relative values of currencies may have a significant effect on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows. We are exposed to the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on our costs and revenue. Approximately 60 of our net sales for fiscal 2021 were invoiced in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, and we expect non-U.S. dollar revenue to continue to represent a significant portion of our future net sales. We have elected not to hedge this foreign currency exposure. Therefore, when the U.S. dollar strengthens in relation to the currencies of the countries where we sell our products, such as the euro or Asian currencies, our U.S. dollar reported revenue and income will decrease. We manage certain cash, intercompany, and other balance sheet currency exposures in part by entering into financial derivative contracts. In addition to the risk of non-performance by the counterparty to these contracts, our efforts to manage these risks might not be successful. We have suffered and could continue to suffer significant business interruptions, including impacts resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. Our operations and those of our suppliers and customers, and the supply chains that support their operations, may be vulnerable to interruption by natural disasters such as earthquakes, tsunamis, typhoons, tornados, or floods; other disasters such as fires, explosions, acts of terrorism or war, or disease or other adverse health developments, including impacts resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic; or failures of management information or other systems due to internal or external causes. In addition, such interruptions could result in a widespread crisis that could adversely affect the economies and financial markets of many countries, resulting in an economic downturn that could affect demand for our end customers products. If a business interruption occurs and we are unsuccessful in our continuing efforts to minimize the impact of these events, our business, results of operations, financial position, and cash flows could be materially adversely affected. The COVID-19 pandemic impacted and continues to impact countries, communities, workforces, supply chains, and markets around the world, and as a result, we have experienced disruptions and restrictions on our employees ability to travel, as well as temporary closures of our facilities and the facilities of our customers, suppliers, and other vendors in our supply chain. As a result of the ongoing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, some of our employees are continuing to work from home on a full-time or part-time basis, which may increase our vulnerability to cyber and other information technology risks. The COVID-19 pandemic had a significant, negative impact on our sales and operating results during fiscal 2020 and continued

 to negatively affect certain of our businesses in fiscal 2021. The COVID-19 pandemic may have a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations in future periods. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will further impact our business and our financial results will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. Such developments may include the further spread of the virus to additional persons and geographic regions; the severity of the virus; variant strains of the virus; the duration of the pandemic; resumption of high levels of infections and hospitalizations; the success of public health advancements, including vaccine production and distribution; the resulting impact on our suppliers and customers supply chains and financial positions, including their ability to pay us; the actions that may be taken by various governmental authorities in response to the outbreak in jurisdictions in which we operate; and the possible impact on the global economy and local economies in which we operate. Further, to the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects our business, results of operations, or financial condition, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this Risk Factors section. We could be adversely affected by a decline in the market value of our pension plans investment portfolios or a reduction in returns on plan assets. Concerns about deterioration in the global economy, together with concerns about credit, inflation, or deflation, have caused and could continue to cause significant volatility in the price of all securities, including fixed income and equity securities, which has reduced and could further reduce the value of our pension plans investment portfolios. In addition, the expected returns on plan assets may not be achieved. A decrease in the value of our pension plans investment portfolios or a reduction in returns on plan assets could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows. Disruption in credit markets and volatility in equity markets may affect our ability to access sufficient funding. The global equity markets have been volatile and at times credit markets have been disrupted, which has reduced the availability of investment capital and credit. Downgrades of sovereign debt credit ratings have similarly affected the availability and cost of capital. As a result, we may be unable to access adequate funding to operate and grow our business. Our inability to access adequate funding or to generate sufficient cash from operations may require us to reconsider certain projects and capital expenditures. The extent of any impact will depend on several factors, including our operating cash flows, the duration of tight credit conditions and volatile equity markets, our credit ratings and credit capacity, the cost of financing, and other general economic and business conditions. We are subject to global risks of political, economic, and military instability. Our workforce; manufacturing, research, administrative, and sales facilities; markets; customers; and suppliers are located throughout the world. As a result, we are exposed to risks that could negatively affect sales or profitability, including: changes in global trade policies, including sanctions, tariffs, trade barriers, and trade disputes; regulations related to customs and import/export matters; variations in lengths of payment cycles and challenges in collecting accounts receivable; tax law and regulatory changes in Switzerland, the U.S., and the EU among other jurisdictions, including tax law and regulatory changes that may be effected as a result of tax policy recommendations from quasi-governmental organizations such as the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development OECD ), examinations by taxing authorities, variations in tax laws from country to country, changes to the terms of income tax treaties, and difficulties in the tax-efficient repatriation of cash generated or held in a number of jurisdictions; employment regulations and local labor conditions, including increases in employment costs, particularly in low-cost regions in which we currently operate; difficulties protecting intellectual property; instability in economic or political conditions, including sovereign debt levels, Eurozone uncertainty, inflation, recession, and actual or anticipated military or political conflicts;

 the impact of the United Kingdom s withdrawal from the EU (commonly referred to as Brexit could cause disruptions to, and create uncertainty surrounding, our business, including affecting our relationships with existing and potential customers and suppliers. The effects of Brexit, including long-lasting effects of Brexit on EU market access, will depend on more permanent agreements between the United Kingdom and the EU to be negotiated during the transition period; and the impact of each of the foregoing on our outsourcing and procurement arrangements. We have sizeable operations in China, including 16 principal manufacturing sites. In addition, approximately 22 of our net sales in fiscal 2021 were made to customers in China. Economic conditions in China have been, and may continue to be, volatile and uncertain. In addition, the legal and regulatory system in China continues to evolve and is subject to change. Accordingly, our operations and transactions with customers in China could be adversely affected by changes to market conditions, changes to the regulatory environment, or interpretation of Chinese law. In addition, any downgrade by rating agencies of long-term U.S. sovereign debt or downgrades or defaults of sovereign debt of other nations may negatively affect global financial markets and economic conditions, which could negatively affect our business, financial condition, and liquidity. Changes in U.S. federal tax laws could result in adverse consequences to U.S. persons treated as owning 10 or more of our shares. Although we are a Swiss corporation, recent U.S. tax law changes have expanded application of certain ownership attribution rules and cause certain of our non-U.S. subsidiaries to be treated as Controlled Foreign Corporations CFCs for U.S. federal income tax purposes. A U.S. person that is treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as owning, directly, indirectly, or constructively, 10 or more of our shares may be required to annually report and include in its U.S. taxable income its pro rata share of certain types of income earned by our subsidiaries that are treated as CFCs, whether or not we make any distributions to such U.S. shareholder. A U.S. person that owns 10 or more of our shares should consult a tax adviser regarding the potential implications to it of these changes in U.S. federal income tax law. The risk of U.S. federal income tax reporting and compliance obligations with respect to our subsidiaries that are treated as CFCs may deter our current shareholders from increasing their investment in us, and others from investing in us, which could impact the demand for, and value of, our shares. Risks Relating to the Industry in Which We Operate We are dependent on the automotive and other industries. We are dependent on end market dynamics to sell our products, and our operating results could be adversely affected by cyclical and reduced demand in these markets. Periodic downturns in our customers industries can significantly reduce demand for certain of our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows. Approximately 43 of our net sales for fiscal 2021 were to customers in the automotive industry. The automotive industry is dominated by large manufacturers that can exert significant price pressure on their suppliers. Additionally, the automotive industry has historically experienced significant downturns during periods of deteriorating global or regional economic or credit conditions. As a supplier of automotive electronics products, our sales of these products and our profitability have been and could continue to be negatively affected by significant declines in global or regional economic or credit conditions and changes in the operations, products, business models, part-sourcing requirements, financial condition, and market share of automotive manufacturers, as well as potential consolidations among automotive manufacturers. During fiscal 2021, approximately 10 of our net sales were to customers in the commercial transportation market, 9 of our net sales were to customers in the industrial equipment end market, and 8 of our net sales were to customers in the data and devices end market. Demand in the commercial transportation industry is impacted by the economic environment and market conditions in the heavy truck, construction, agriculture, and recreational vehicle markets. The industrial equipment industry is dependent upon economic conditions, including customer investment in factory and warehouse automation, process control systems, and building automation and smart city infrastructure, as well as market conditions in the rail transportation, lighting, and other major industrial markets we serve. Demand for data and devices can fluctuate significantly, depending on the underlying business and consumer demand for data communication, computer, and 
 10 

Table of Contents 
 consumer electronics products. The overall market trends of increased data connectivity and continued movement to high-speed cloud applications have had a favorable impact on demand. We encounter competition in substantially all areas of the electronic components industry. We operate in highly competitive markets for electronic components and expect that both direct and indirect competition will increase in the future. Our overall competitive position depends on various factors including the price, quality, and performance of our products; the level of customer service; the development of new technology; our ability to participate in emerging markets; and customers expectations relating to socially responsible operations. The competition we experience across product lines from other companies ranges in size from large, diversified manufacturers to small, highly specialized manufacturers. The electronic components industry has become increasingly concentrated and globalized in recent years, and our major competitors have significant financial resources and technological capabilities. A number of these competitors compete with us primarily on price, and in some instances may have the benefit of lower production costs for certain products. We cannot provide assurance that additional competitors will not enter our markets, or that we will be able to compete successfully against existing or new competitors. Increased competition may result in price reductions, reduced margins, or loss of market share, any of which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows. We are dependent on market acceptance of our new product introductions and product innovations for future revenue. Substantially all markets in which we operate are impacted by technological change or change in consumer tastes and preferences, which are rapid in certain end markets. Our operating results depend substantially upon our ability to continually design, develop, introduce, and sell new and innovative products; to modify existing products; and to customize products to meet customer requirements driven by such change. There are numerous risks inherent in these processes, including the risk that we will be unable to anticipate the direction of technological change or that we will be unable to develop and market profitable new products and applications in time to satisfy customer demands. Like other suppliers to the electronics industry, we are subject to continuing pressure to lower our prices. We have experienced, and we expect to continue to experience, continuing pressure to lower our prices. Although price erosion was not significant in fiscal 2021, we have historically experienced price erosion averaging from 1 to 2 each year. To maintain our margins, we must continue to reduce our costs by similar amounts. We cannot provide assurance that continuing pressures to reduce our prices will not have a material adverse effect on our margins, results of operations, financial position, and cash flows. We may be negatively affected as our customers and vendors continue to consolidate. Many of the industries to which we sell our products, as well as many of the industries from which we buy materials, have become more concentrated in recent years, including the automotive, data and devices, and aerospace and defense industries. Consolidation of customers may lead to decreased product purchases from us. In addition, as our customers buy in larger volumes, their volume buying power has increased, enabling them to negotiate more favorable pricing and find alternative sources from which to purchase. Our materials suppliers similarly have increased their ability to negotiate favorable pricing. These trends may adversely affect the margins on our products, particularly for commodity components. The life cycles of certain of our products can be very short. The life cycles of certain of our products can be very short relative to their development cycle. As a result, the resources devoted to product sales and marketing may not result in material revenue and, from time to time, we may need to write off excess or obsolete inventory or equipment. If we were to incur significant engineering expenses and investments in inventory and equipment that we were not able to recover, and we were not able to compensate for those expenses, our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.

 Risks Relating to Our Operations Our results are sensitive to raw material availability, quality, and cost. We are a large buyer of resins, chemicals, additives, and metals, including copper, gold, silver, aluminum, brass, steel, and zinc. Many of these raw materials are produced in a limited number of countries around the world or are only available from a limited number of suppliers. The prices of many of these raw materials continue to increase and fluctuations may persist in the future. In addition, feedstock for resins and resins themselves, as well as certain other commodities, are increasingly subject to varied and unrelated force majeure events worldwide further impacting price and availability. If we have difficulty obtaining these raw materials, the quality of available raw materials deteriorates, or there are significant price increases for these raw materials, it could have a substantial impact on the price we pay for raw materials. To the extent we cannot compensate for cost increases through productivity improvements or price increases to our customers, our margins may decline, materially affecting our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows. In addition, we use financial instruments to hedge the volatility of certain commodities prices. The success of our hedging program depends on accurate forecasts of planned consumption of the hedged commodity materials. We could experience unanticipated hedge gains or losses if these forecasts are inaccurate. In accordance with the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the SEC established annual disclosure and reporting requirements for those companies who use tin, tantalum, tungsten, or gold conflict minerals or 3TG mined from the Democratic Republic of the Congo DRC and adjoining countries (together with the DRC, the Covered Countries in their products. These requirements, as well as new and additional regulations like the EU s Conflict Minerals Regulation, could affect the sourcing, pricing, and availability of 3TG used in the manufacture of certain of our products, and may result in only a limited pool of suppliers who can demonstrate that they do not source any 3TG from the Covered Countries. Accordingly, we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to obtain non-conflict 3TG in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices. Further, since our supply chain is complex, we may face reputational challenges with our customers and other stakeholders if we are unable to meet customer non-conflict 3TG standards or sufficiently verify the origins and chain of custody for all conflict minerals used in our products through our due diligence procedures. We may use components and products manufactured by third parties. We may rely on third-party suppliers for the components used in our products, and we may rely on third-party manufacturers to manufacture certain of our assemblies and finished products. Our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows could be adversely affected if such third parties lack sufficient quality control or if there are significant changes in their financial or business condition. If these third parties fail to deliver quality products, parts, and components on time and at reasonable prices, we could have difficulties fulfilling our orders, sales and profits could decline, and our commercial reputation could be damaged. Our future success is significantly dependent on our ability to attract and retain management and executive management employees. Our success depends to a significant extent upon our continued ability to retain our management and executive management employees and hire new management and executive management employees to replace, succeed, or add to members of our management team. Our management team has significant industry experience and would be difficult to replace. Competition for management talent is intense, and any difficulties we may have to retain or hire members of management to achieve our objectives may have an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows. Security breaches and other disruptions to our information technology infrastructure or violations of data privacy laws could interfere with our operations, compromise confidential information, and expose us to liability which could materially adversely impact our business and reputation. Security breaches and other disruptions to our information technology infrastructure could interfere with our operations; compromise information belonging to us, our employees, customers, and suppliers; and expose us to liability which could adversely impact our business and reputation. In the normal course of business, we rely on information technology networks and systems, some of which are managed by third parties, to process, transmit, and store electronic information, and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities. Additionally, we collect and store certain data, including proprietary business information and customer and employee data, and may have access to confidential or personal information in certain of our businesses that is subject to privacy and security laws, regulations, and 
 12 

Table of Contents 
 customer-imposed controls. Specifically, we are subject to the laws of various states and countries where we operate or do business related to solicitation, collection, processing, transferring, storing, or use of consumer, customer, vendor, or employee information or related data, including the EU s General Data Protection Regulation, which went into effect in May 2018, and the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, which went into effect in January 2020. In addition, several other countries in which we operate or do business, such as China, have enacted or are considering enacting laws that impose additional data transfer restrictions. If countries in which we operate or do business were to adopt data localization or data residency laws, we could be required to implement new or expand existing data storage protocols, build new storage facilities, and/or devote additional resources to comply with the requirements of such laws, any of which could have significant implications to business operations and costs. In addition to our own systems, we have outsourced, and expect to continue to outsource, certain support services, including cloud storage systems, cloud computing services, and system development and support services to third parties, which has in the past and in the future may subject our information technology and other sensitive information to additional risk. Despite our cybersecurity measures (including employee training, monitoring of networks and systems, and maintenance of backup and protective systems) which are reviewed and upgraded to mitigate evolving cybersecurity threats, our information technology networks and infrastructure has been and may still be vulnerable to damage, disruptions (including, but not limited to, computer viruses and other malware, denial of service, and ransomware), or shutdowns due to attack by hackers, state-sponsored organizations with significant financial and technological resources, breaches, employee error or malfeasance, power outages, computer viruses, telecommunication or utility failures, systems failures, natural disasters, pandemics (including COVID-19), or other catastrophic events, which may require us to notify regulators, customers, or employees, and enlist identity theft protection in the event of a privacy breach. We have been the target of attempted cyber intrusions. We continue to monitor and develop our systems to protect the integrity and functionality of our information technology infrastructure and access to and the security of our intellectual property and our employees , customers , and suppliers data. Security breaches and other disruptions to our information technology infrastructure or violations of applicable laws could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability or penalties, disruption in operations, and damage to our reputation which could materially adversely affect our business. While we have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, threats to our information technology networks and infrastructure, to date none of these threats have had a material impact on our business or operations. In addition, as a result of the ongoing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, some of our employees are continuing to work from home on a full-time or part-time basis, which may increase our vulnerability to cyber and other information technology risks. Covenants in our debt instruments may adversely affect us. Our five-year unsecured senior revolving credit facility Credit Facility contains financial and other covenants, such as a limit on the ratio of Consolidated Total Debt to Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the Credit Facility) and limits on the amount of subsidiary debt and incurrence of liens. Our outstanding notes indentures contain customary covenants including limits on incurrence of liens, sale and lease-back transactions, and our ability to consolidate, merge, and sell assets. Although none of these covenants are presently restrictive to our operations, our continued ability to meet the Credit Facility financial covenant can be affected by events beyond our control, and we cannot provide assurance that we will continue to comply with the covenant. A breach of any of our covenants could result in a default under our Credit Facility or indentures. Upon the occurrence of certain defaults under our Credit Facility and indentures, the lenders or trustee could elect to declare all amounts outstanding thereunder to be immediately due and payable, and our lenders could terminate commitments to extend further credit under our Credit Facility. If the lenders or trustee accelerate the repayment of borrowings, we cannot provide assurance that we will have sufficient assets or access to lenders or capital markets to repay or fund the repayment of any amounts outstanding under our Credit Facility and our other affected indebtedness. Acceleration of any debt obligation under any of our material debt instruments may permit the holders or trustee of our other material debt to accelerate payment of debt obligations to the creditors thereunder. The indentures governing our outstanding senior notes contain covenants that may require us to offer to buy back the notes for a price equal to 101 of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the repurchase date, upon a change of control triggering event (as defined in the indentures). We cannot provide assurance that we will have sufficient funds available or access to funding to repurchase tendered notes in that event, which could result in a default under the notes. Any future debt that we incur may contain covenants regarding repurchases in the event of a change of control triggering event.

 The market price of our shares may fluctuate widely. The market price of our shares may fluctuate widely, depending upon many factors, including: our quarterly or annual earnings; quarterly or annual sales or earnings guidance that we may provide or changes thereto; actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results; volatility in financial markets and market fluctuations caused by global and regional economic conditions and investors concerns about potential risks to future economic growth; changes in earnings estimates by securities analysts or our ability to meet those estimates; changes in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations, or principles; tax legislative and regulatory actions and proposals in Switzerland, the U.S., the EU, and other jurisdictions; announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions or dispositions; and the operating and stock price performance of comparable companies and companies that serve end markets important to our business. Risks Relating to Strategic Transactions Future acquisitions may not be successful. We regularly evaluate the possible acquisition of strategic businesses, product lines, or technologies which have the potential to strengthen our market position or enhance our existing product offerings, and we have completed a number of acquisitions in recent years. We anticipate that we will continue to pursue acquisition opportunities as part of our growth strategy. We cannot provide assurance that we will identify or successfully complete transactions with acquisition candidates in the future. We also cannot provide assurance that completed acquisitions will be successful. If an acquired business fails to operate as anticipated or cannot be successfully integrated with our existing business, our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. Future acquisitions could require us to issue additional debt or equity. If we were to make a substantial acquisition with cash, the acquisition may need to be financed in part through funding from banks, public offerings or private placements of debt or equity securities, or other arrangements. This acquisition financing might decrease our ratio of earnings to fixed charges and adversely affect other leverage measures. We cannot provide assurance that sufficient acquisition financing would be available to us on acceptable terms if and when required. If we were to complete an acquisition partially or wholly funded by issuing equity securities or equity-linked securities, the issued securities may have a dilutive effect on the interests of the holders of our shares. Divestitures of some of our businesses or product lines may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows. We continue to evaluate the strategic fit of specific businesses and products which may result in additional divestitures. Any divestitures may result in significant write-offs, including those related to goodwill and other intangible assets, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position. Divestitures could involve additional risks, including difficulties in the separation of operations, services, products, and personnel; the diversion of management s attention from other business concerns; the disruption of our business; and the potential loss of key employees. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in addressing these or any other significant risks encountered.

 Risks Relating to Intellectual Property, Litigation, and Regulations Our ability to compete effectively depends, in part, on our ability to maintain the proprietary nature of our products and technology. The electronics industry is characterized by litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights. Within this industry, companies have become more aggressive in asserting and defending patent claims against competitors. There can be no assurance that we will not be subject to future litigation alleging infringement or invalidity of certain of our intellectual property rights or that we will not have to pursue litigation to protect our property rights. Depending on the importance of the technology, product, patent, trademark, or trade secret in question, an unfavorable outcome regarding one of these matters may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows. We are a defendant to a variety of litigation in the course of our business that could cause a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows. In the normal course of business, we are, from time to time, a defendant in litigation, including litigation alleging the infringement of intellectual property rights, anti-competitive behavior, product liability, breach of contract, and employment-related claims. In certain circumstances, patent infringement and antitrust laws permit successful plaintiffs to recover treble damages. The defense of these lawsuits may divert our management s attention, and we may incur significant expenses in defending these lawsuits. In addition, we may be required to pay damage awards or settlements, or become subject to injunctions or other equitable remedies, that could cause a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows. If any of our operations are found not to comply with applicable antitrust or competition laws or applicable trade regulations, our business may suffer. Our operations are subject to applicable antitrust and competition laws in the jurisdictions in which we conduct our business, in particular the U.S. and the EU. These laws prohibit, among other things, anticompetitive agreements and practices. If any of our commercial agreements and practices with respect to the electronic components or other markets are found to violate or infringe such laws, we may be subject to civil and other penalties. We may also be subject to third-party claims for damages. Further, agreements that infringe these antitrust and competition laws may be void and unenforceable, in whole or in part, or require modification to be lawful and enforceable. If we are unable to enforce our commercial agreements, whether at all or in material part, our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows could be adversely affected. We also must comply with applicable trade regulations in the jurisdictions where we operate. A small portion of our products, including defense-related products, may require governmental import and export licenses, whose issuance may be influenced by geopolitical and other events. Any failure to maintain compliance with trade regulations could limit our ability to import and export raw materials and finished goods into or from the relevant jurisdiction, which could negatively impact our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows. In this regard, we are investigating our past compliance with relevant U.S. trade controls and have made voluntary disclosures of apparent trade controls violations to the U.S. Department of Commerce s Bureau of Industry and Security BIS and the U.S. State Department s Directorate of Defense Trade Controls DDTC ). We are cooperating with the BIS and DDTC on these matters, and both our internal assessment and the resulting investigations by the agencies remain ongoing. We are unable to predict the timing and final outcome of the agencies investigations. An unfavorable outcome may include fines or penalties imposed in response to our disclosures, but we are not yet able to reasonably estimate the extent of any such fines or penalties. While we have reserved for potential fines and penalties relating to these matters based on our current understanding of the facts, the investigations into these matters have yet to be completed and the final outcome of such investigations and related fines and penalties may differ from amounts currently reserved. We could be adversely affected by violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the United Kingdom s Bribery Act, and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws. The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the United Kingdom s Bribery Act, and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Our policies mandate compliance with these anti-bribery laws. We operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree, and in certain circumstances, strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices. Despite our training and compliance 
 15 

Table of Contents 
 program, we cannot provide assurance that our internal control policies and procedures always will protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees or agents. Violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could disrupt our business and result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows. Our operations expose us to the risk of material environmental liabilities, litigation, government enforcement actions, and reputational risk. We are subject to numerous federal, state, and local environmental protection and health and safety laws and regulations in the various countries where we operate and where our products are sold. These laws and regulations govern, among other things: the generation, storage, use, and transportation of hazardous materials; emissions or discharges of substances into the environment; investigation and remediation of hazardous substances or materials at various sites; greenhouse gas emissions; product hazardous material content; and the health and safety of our employees. We may not have been, or we may not always be, in compliance with all environmental and health and safety laws and regulations. If we violate these laws, we could be fined, criminally charged, or otherwise sanctioned by regulators. In addition, environmental and health and safety laws are becoming more stringent, resulting in increased costs and compliance requirements. Certain environmental laws assess liability on current or previous owners or operators of real property for the costs of investigation, removal, and remediation of hazardous substances or materials at their properties or at properties at which they have disposed of hazardous substances. Liability for investigation, removal, and remediation costs under certain regulatory regimes, such as U.S. federal and state laws, is retroactive, strict, and joint and several. In addition to cleanup actions brought by governmental authorities, private parties could bring personal injury or other claims due to the presence of, or exposure to, hazardous substances. We have received notifications from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, other environmental agencies, and third parties that conditions at a number of currently and formerly-owned or operated sites where we and others have disposed of hazardous substances require investigation, cleanup, and other possible remedial action and require that we reimburse the government or otherwise pay for the costs of investigation and remediation and for natural resource damage claims from such sites. We also have independently investigated various sites and determined that further investigation and/or remediation is necessary. While we plan for future capital and operating expenditures to maintain compliance with environmental laws, we cannot provide assurance that our costs of complying with current or future environmental protection and health and safety laws, or our liabilities arising from past or future releases of, or exposures to, hazardous substances will not exceed our estimates or adversely affect our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows or that we will not be subject to additional environmental claims for personal injury, property damage, and/or cleanup in the future based on our past, present, or future business activities. Our products are subject to various requirements related to chemical usage, hazardous material content, recycling, and other circular economy initiatives. The EU, China, and other jurisdictions in which our products are sold have enacted or are proposing to enact laws addressing environmental and other impacts from product disposal, use of hazardous materials in products, use of chemicals in manufacturing, recycling of products at the end of their useful life, circular economy initiatives, and other related matters. These laws include but are not limited to the EU Restriction of Hazardous Substances, End of Life Vehicle, and Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directives; the EU REACH Regulation; and the China Administrative Measures for the Restriction of Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Products. These laws prohibit the use of certain substances in the manufacture of our products and directly and indirectly impose a variety of requirements for modification of manufacturing processes, registration, chemical testing, labeling, and other matters. These laws continue to proliferate and 
 16

 expand in these and other jurisdictions to address other materials and other aspects of our product manufacturing and sale. These laws could make the manufacture or sale of our products more expensive or impossible, could limit our ability to sell our products in certain jurisdictions, and could result in liability for product recalls, penalties, or other claims. Risks Relating to Our Swiss Jurisdiction of Incorporation As a Swiss corporation, we have less flexibility with respect to certain aspects of capital management involving the issuance of shares. As a Swiss corporation, our board of directors may not declare and pay dividends or distributions on our shares or reclassify reserves on our standalone unconsolidated Swiss balance sheet without shareholder approval and without satisfying certain other requirements. In addition, our articles of association allow us to create authorized share capital that can be issued by the board of directors, but this authorization is limited to (i) authorized share capital up to 50 of the existing registered shares with such authorization valid for a maximum of two years, which authorization period ends on March 11, 2022, approved by our shareholders at our March 11, 2020 annual general meeting of shareholders and (ii) conditional share capital of up to 50 of the existing registered shares that may be issued only for specific purposes. Additionally, subject to specified exceptions, Swiss law grants preemptive rights to existing shareholders to subscribe for new issuances of shares from authorized share capital and advance subscription rights to existing shareholders to subscribe for new issuances of shares from conditional share capital. Swiss law also does not provide much flexibility in the various terms that can attach to different classes of shares, and reserves for approval by shareholders many types of corporate actions, including the creation of shares with preferential rights with respect to liquidation, dividends, and/or voting. Moreover, under Swiss law, we generally may not issue registered shares for an amount below par value without prior shareholder approval to decrease the par value of our registered shares. Any such actions for which our shareholders must vote will require that we file a proxy statement with the SEC and convene a meeting of shareholders, which would delay the timing to execute such actions. Such limitations provide the board of directors less flexibility with respect to our capital management. While we do not believe that Swiss law requirements relating to the issuance of shares will have a material adverse effect on us, we cannot provide assurance that situations will not arise where such flexibility would have provided substantial benefits to our shareholders and such limitations on our capital management flexibility would make our stock less attractive to investors. We might not be able to make distributions on our shares without subjecting shareholders to Swiss withholding tax. We anticipate making distributions to shareholders through a reduction of contributed surplus (as determined for Swiss tax and statutory purposes) in order to make the distributions on our shares to shareholders free of Swiss withholding tax. Various tax law and corporate law proposals in Switzerland, if passed in the future, may affect our ability to pay dividends or distributions to our shareholders free from Swiss withholding tax. There can be no assurance that we will be able to meet the legal requirements for future distributions to shareholders through dividends from contributed surplus or through a reduction of registered share capital, or that Swiss withholding rules would not be changed in the future. In addition, over the long term, the amount of registered share capital available for reductions will be limited. Our ability to pay dividends or distributions to our shareholders free from Swiss withholding tax is a significant component of our capital management and shareholder return practices that we believe is important to our shareholders, and any restriction on our ability to do so could make our stock less attractive to investors. Currency fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and the Swiss franc may limit the amount available for any future distributions on our shares without subjecting shareholders to Swiss withholding tax. The registered share capital in our unconsolidated Swiss statutory financial statements is denominated in Swiss francs. Although distributions that are effected through a return of contributed surplus or registered share capital are expected to be paid in U.S. dollars, shareholder resolutions with respect to such distributions must take into account the Swiss francs denomination of the registered share capital. If the U.S. dollar were to increase in value relative to the Swiss franc, the U.S. dollar amount of registered share capital available for future distributions without Swiss withholding tax will decrease. We have certain limitations on our ability to repurchase our shares. The Swiss Code of Obligations regulates a corporation s ability to hold or repurchase its own shares. We and our subsidiaries may only repurchase shares to the extent that sufficient freely distributable reserves (including contributed surplus as determined for Swiss tax and statutory purposes) are available. The aggregate par value of our registered shares held by us and our subsidiaries may not exceed 10 of our registered share capital. We may repurchase our registered shares 
 17 

Table of Contents 
 beyond the statutory limit of 10 , however, only if our shareholders have adopted a resolution at a general meeting of shareholders authorizing the board of directors to repurchase registered shares in an amount in excess of 10 and the repurchased shares are dedicated for cancellation. Additionally, various corporate law proposals in Switzerland, if passed in the future, may affect our ability to repurchase our shares. Our ability to repurchase our shares is a significant component of our capital management and shareholder return practices that we believe is important to our shareholders, and any restriction on our ability to repurchase our shares could make our stock less attractive to investors. Registered holders of our shares must be registered as shareholders with voting rights in order to vote at shareholder meetings. Our articles of association contain a provision regarding voting rights that is required by Swiss law for Swiss companies like us that issue registered shares (as opposed to bearer shares). This provision provides that to be able to exercise voting rights, holders of our shares must be registered in our share register (Aktienbuch) as shareholders with voting rights. Only shareholders whose shares have been registered with voting rights on the record date may participate in and vote at our shareholders meetings, but all shareholders will be entitled to dividends, distributions, preemptive rights, advance subscription rights, and liquidation proceeds. The board of directors may, in its discretion, refuse to register shares as shares with voting rights if a shareholder does not fulfill certain disclosure requirements in our articles of association. Certain provisions of our articles of association may reduce the likelihood of any unsolicited acquisition proposal or potential change of control that our shareholders might consider favorable. Our articles of association contain provisions that could be considered anti-takeover provisions because they would make it harder for a third party to acquire us without the consent of our incumbent board of directors. Under these provisions, among others: shareholders may act only at shareholder meetings and not by written consent, and restrictions will apply to any merger or other business combination between our company and any holder of 15 or more of our issued voting shares who became such without the prior approval of our board of directors. These provisions may only be amended by the affirmative vote of the holders of 80 of our issued voting shares, which could have the effect of discouraging an unsolicited acquisition proposal or delaying, deferring, or preventing a change of control transaction that might involve a premium price, or otherwise be considered favorable by our shareholders. Our articles of association also contain provisions permitting our board of directors to issue new shares from authorized or conditional capital (in either case, representing a maximum of 50 of the shares presently registered in the commercial register and in case of issuances from authorized capital, until March 11, 2022 unless re-authorized by shareholders for a subsequent two-year period) without shareholder approval and without regard for shareholders preemptive rights or advance subscription rights, for the purpose of the defense of an actual, threatened, or potential unsolicited takeover bid, in relation to which the board of directors, upon consultation with an independent financial advisor, has not recommended acceptance to the shareholders. We note that Swiss courts have not addressed whether or not a takeover bid of this nature is an acceptable reason under Swiss law for withdrawing or limiting preemptive rights with respect to authorized share capital or advance subscription rights with respect to conditional share capital. In addition, the New York Stock Exchange NYSE ), on which our shares are listed, requires shareholder approval for issuances of shares equal to 20 or more of the outstanding shares or voting power, with limited exceptions. Global legislative and regulatory actions and proposals could cause a material change in our worldwide effective corporate tax rate and our global cash taxes. Various legislative and regulatory proposals have been directed at multinational companies with operations in lower-tax jurisdictions. There has been heightened focus on adoption of such legislation and on other initiatives, such as: the OECD s initiative to develop agreed-upon best practices to prevent base erosion and profit shifting, which contemplate the creation of a global minimum corporate tax rate and changes to numerous long-standing tax principles related to the distribution of profits between affiliated entities in different tax jurisdictions, EU and other country efforts to adopt certain OECD proposals and modified OECD proposals (including the Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive, state aid cases, and various transparency proposals), and 
 18

 tax policy changes in the U.S., such as additional federal tax reform measures, new tax regulations, and revisions to the Model Income Tax Treaty. If these proposals are adopted in the main jurisdictions in which we do business, they could, among other things, increase cash taxes, cause double taxation, increase audit risk, and materially increase our worldwide corporate effective tax rate. We cannot predict the outcome of any specific legislative proposals or initiatives, and we cannot provide assurance that any such legislation or initiative will not apply to us. In October 2021, the OECD made progress in its efforts to reform the international tax system with 136 of the 140 participating countries and jurisdictions joining a global minimum tax agreement. This agreement introduces a 15 global minimum corporate tax rate which will apply to companies with revenue over a set threshold. This tax will be assessed on a country-by-country basis, potentially starting as early as 2023. Legislation in the U.S. could adversely impact our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows. Various U.S. federal and state legislative proposals have been introduced in recent years that may negatively impact the growth of our business by denying government contracts to U.S. companies that have moved to lower-tax jurisdictions. We expect the U.S. Congress to continue to consider implementation and/or expansion of policies that would restrict the federal and state governments from contracting with entities that have corporate locations abroad. We cannot predict the likelihood that, or final form in which, any such proposed legislation might become law, the nature of regulations that may be promulgated under any future legislative enactments, the effect such enactments and increased regulatory scrutiny may have on our business, or the outcome of any specific legislative proposals. Therefore, we cannot provide assurance that any such legislative action will not apply to us. In addition, we are unable to predict whether the final form of any potential legislation discussed above also would affect our indirect sales to U.S. federal or state governments or the willingness of our non-governmental customers to do business with us. As a result of these uncertainties, we are unable to assess the potential impact of any proposed legislation in this area and cannot provide assurance that the impact will not be materially adverse to us. Swiss law differs from the laws in effect in the U.S. and may afford less protection to holders of our securities. As we are organized under the laws of Switzerland, it may not be possible to enforce court judgments obtained in the U.S. against us in Switzerland based on the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal or state securities laws. In addition, there is some uncertainty as to whether the courts of Switzerland would recognize or enforce judgments of U.S. courts obtained against us or our directors or officers based on the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal or state securities laws or hear actions against us or those persons based on those laws. We have been advised that the U.S. and Switzerland currently do not have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters. Some remedies available under the laws of U.S. jurisdictions, including some remedies available under the U.S. federal securities laws, would not be allowed in Swiss courts as they are contrary to Switzerland s public policy. Swiss law differs in certain material respects from laws generally applicable to U.S. corporations and their shareholders. These differences include the manner in which directors must disclose transactions in which they have an interest, the rights of shareholders to bring class action and derivative lawsuits, and the scope of indemnification available to directors and officers. Thus, holders of our securities may have more difficulty protecting their interests than would holders of securities of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction of the U.S. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None.

 ITEM 2. PROPERTIES Our principal executive office is located in Schaffhausen, Switzerland. As of fiscal year end 2021, we owned approximately 18 million square feet and leased approximately 10 million square feet of aggregate floor space, used primarily for manufacturing, warehousing, and office space. We believe our facilities are suitable for the conduct of our business and adequate for our current needs. We manufacture our products in over 25 countries worldwide. Our manufacturing sites focus on various aspects of our manufacturing processes, including our primary processes of stamping, plating, molding, extrusion, beaming, and assembly. We consider the productive capacity of our manufacturing facilities sufficient. As of fiscal year end 2021, our principal centers of manufacturing output by segment and geographic region were as follows: 

Transportation Industrial Communications Solutions Solutions Solutions Total (number of manufacturing facilities) EMEA 22 21 3 46 Asia Pacific 9 6 7 22 Americas 10 22 3 35 Total 41 49 13 103 ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS In the normal course of business, we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims, including product liability matters, employment disputes, disputes on agreements, other commercial disputes, environmental matters, antitrust claims, and tax matters, including non-income tax matters such as value added tax, sales and use tax, real estate tax, and transfer tax. In addition, we operate in an industry susceptible to significant patent legal claims. At any given time in the normal course of business, we are involved as either a plaintiff or defendant in a number of patent infringement actions. If infringement of a third party s patent were to be determined against us, we might be required to make significant royalty or other payments or might be subject to an injunction or other limitation on our ability to manufacture or sell one or more products. If a patent owned by or licensed to us were determined to be invalid or unenforceable, we might be required to reduce the value of the patent on our Consolidated Balance Sheet and to record a corresponding charge, which could be significant in amount. Management believes that these legal proceedings and claims likely will be resolved over an extended period of time. Although it is not feasible to predict the outcome of these proceedings, based upon our experience, current information, and applicable law, we do not expect that the outcome of these proceedings, either individually or in the aggregate, will have a material effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.

 Overview We are a global industrial technology leader creating a safer, sustainable, productive, and connected future. Our broad range of connectivity and sensor solutions, proven in the harshest environments, enable advancements in transportation, industrial applications, medical technology, energy, data communications, and the home. Summary of Fiscal 2021 Performance Our fiscal 2021 net sales increased 22.6 from fiscal 2020 levels due to sales increases in the Transportation Solutions and Communications Solutions segments, and, to a lesser degree, the Industrial Solutions segment. On an organic basis, our net sales increased 18.2 in fiscal 2021 as compared to fiscal 2020. In fiscal 2020, our net sales included significant, unfavorable impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic. Our net sales by segment were as follows: Transportation Solutions Our net sales increased 31.1 with sales increases in all end markets. Industrial Solutions Our net sales increased 3.5 primarily as a result of sales increases in the industrial equipment end market, partially offset by declines in the aerospace, defense, oil, and gas end market. Communications Solutions Our net sales increased 30.4 due to sales increases in both the appliances and the data and devices end markets. During fiscal 2021, our shareholders approved a dividend payment to shareholders of 2.00 per share, payable in four equal quarterly installments of 0.50 beginning in the third quarter of fiscal 2021 and ending in the second quarter of fiscal 2022. Net cash provided by continuing operating activities was 2,676 million in fiscal 2021. 
 COVID-19 Pandemic A novel strain of coronavirus COVID-19 was first identified in China in December 2019 and subsequently declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization. COVID-19 has surfaced in nearly all regions around the world and resulted in business slowdowns or shutdowns and travel restrictions in affected areas. The pandemic had a significant, negative impact on our sales and operating results during fiscal 2020 and continued to negatively affect certain of our businesses in fiscal 2021. We do not expect that it will continue to have a significant impact on our sales and operating results in the near term. The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted and continues to impact our business operations globally, causing disruption in our suppliers and customers supply chains, some of our business locations to reduce or suspend operations, and a reduction in demand for certain products from direct customers or end markets. In addition, the pandemic had far-reaching impacts on many additional aspects of our operations, both directly and indirectly, including with respect to its impacts on customer behaviors, business and manufacturing operations, inventory, our employees, and the market generally. We assessed the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and adjusted our operations and businesses, a number of which are operating as essential businesses, and will continue to do so if necessary. Throughout our operations, we implemented additional health and safety measures for the protection of our employees, including providing personal protective equipment, enhanced cleaning and sanitizing of our facilities, and remote working arrangements. The extent to which the pandemic will continue to impact our business and the markets we serve will depend on future developments which may include the further spread of the virus, variant strains of the virus, and the resumption of high levels of infections and hospitalizations as well as the success of public health advancements, including vaccine production and distribution. Although we do not expect the COVID-19 pandemic to have a significant impact on our sales and operating results in the near term, it may have a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations in future periods. In response to the pandemic and resulting economic environment, we have taken and continue to focus on actions to manage costs. These include restructuring and other cost reduction initiatives, such as reducing discretionary spending, 
 23 

Table of Contents 
 capital expenditures, and travel. We will continue to actively monitor the situation and may take further actions that alter our business operations as may be required by federal, state, or local authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, customers, suppliers, shareholders, and the communities in which we operate. For further discussion of the risks and uncertainties associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, see Part I. Item 1A. Risk Factors. Outlook In the first quarter of fiscal 2022, we expect our net sales to be approximately 3.7 billion as compared to 3.5 billion in the first quarter of fiscal 2021. This increase is the result of sales growth in the Industrial Solutions and Communications Solutions segments, partially offset by sales declines in the Transportation Solution segment. Additional information regarding expectations for our reportable segments is as follows: Transportation Solutions We expect our net sales to decrease in the automotive end market as a result of declines in global automotive production. We expect content growth to partially offset the impact of the production decline. We expect our net sales to increase in the commercial transportation and sensors end markets. Industrial Solutions We expect our net sales increase to be driven by growth in the industrial equipment end market and, to a lesser degree, the medical and energy end markets. Communications Solutions We expect our net sales to increase in both the data and devices and the appliances end markets. 
 We expect diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to be approximately 1.50 per share in the first quarter of fiscal 2022. This outlook reflects the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates on net sales of approximately 19 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2022 as compared to the same period of fiscal 2021. The above outlook is based on foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices that are consistent with current levels. We are monitoring the current macroeconomic environment, including any continued impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic, and its potential effects on our customers and the end markets we serve. We have taken actions to manage costs and will continue to closely manage our costs in line with economic conditions. Additionally, we are managing our capital resources and monitoring capital availability to ensure that we have sufficient resources to fund future capital needs. See further discussion in Liquidity and Capital Resources. Acquisitions During fiscal 2021, we acquired four businesses for a combined cash purchase price of 422 million, net of cash acquired. The acquisitions were reported as part of our Industrial Solutions segment from the date of acquisition. We acquired five businesses, including First Sensor AG First Sensor ), for a combined cash purchase price of 336 million, net of cash acquired, during fiscal 2020. The acquisitions were reported as part of our Transportation Solutions and Industrial Solutions segments from the date of acquisition. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding acquisitions.

The increase in net sales resulted primarily from organic net sales growth of 18.2 and the positive impact of foreign currency translation of 3.6 due to the strengthening of certain foreign currencies. The significant, unfavorable impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic were included in our net sales in fiscal 2020. See further discussion of net sales below under Segment Results. Net Sales by Geographic Region. Our business operates in three geographic regions EMEA, Asia Pacific, and the Americas and our results of operations are influenced by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Increases or decreases in the value of the U.S. dollar, compared to other currencies, will directly affect our reported results as we translate those currencies into U.S. dollars at the end of each fiscal period. We sell our products into approximately 140 countries, and approximately 60 of our net sales were invoiced in currencies other than the U.S. dollar in fiscal 2021.

We use a wide variety of raw materials in the manufacture of our products. Cost of sales and gross margin are subject to variability in raw material prices. As markets recover from the COVID-19 pandemic, increases in consumer demand have led to shortages and price increases in some of our input materials. In fiscal 2021, we purchased approximately 200 million pounds of copper, 122,000 troy ounces of gold, 2.7 million troy ounces of silver, and 15,000 troy ounces of palladium.

In fiscal 2021, selling, general, and administrative expenses increased 120 million as compared to fiscal 2020 due primarily to higher incentive compensation costs due to improved operational performance, increased selling expenses to support higher sales levels, and the negative impact of foreign currency translation, partially offset by savings attributable to cost control measures and restructuring actions and gains on the sale of real estate. Restructuring and Other Charges, Net. We are committed to continuous productivity improvements, and we evaluate opportunities to simplify our global manufacturing footprint, migrate facilities to lower-cost regions, reduce fixed costs, and eliminate excess capacity. These initiatives are designed to help us maintain our competitiveness in the industry, improve our operating leverage, and position us for future growth. During fiscal 2021 and 2020, we initiated restructuring programs across all segments to optimize our manufacturing footprint and improve the cost structure of the organization. These actions were due in part to the COVID-19 pandemic. We incurred net restructuring charges of 208 million and 257 million in fiscal 2021 and 2020, respectively. Annualized cost savings related to actions initiated in fiscal 2021 are expected to be approximately 80 million and are expected to be realized by the end of fiscal 2023. Cost savings will be reflected primarily in cost of sales and selling, general, and administrative expenses. For fiscal 2022, we expect total restructuring charges to be approximately 150 million and total spending, which will be funded with cash from operations, to be approximately 200 million. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding net restructuring and other charges. Impairment of Goodwill. During fiscal 2020, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of 900 million related to the Sensors reporting unit in our Transportation Solutions segment.

Fiscal 2021 2020 (in millions) Acquisition and integration costs 1 Restructuring and other charges, net 25 42 Total 26 42 Liquidity and Capital Resources Our ability to fund our future capital needs will be affected by our ongoing ability to generate cash from operations and may be affected by our access to capital markets, money markets, or other sources of funding, as well as the capacity and terms of our financing arrangements. We believe that cash generated from operations and, to the extent necessary, these other sources of potential funding will be sufficient to meet our anticipated capital needs for the foreseeable future. We may use excess cash to purchase a portion of our common shares pursuant to our authorized share repurchase program, to acquire strategic businesses or product lines, to pay dividends on our common shares, or to reduce our outstanding debt. The cost or availability of future funding may be impacted by financial market conditions. We will continue to monitor financial markets and respond as necessary to changing conditions, including any developments related to the COVID-19 pandemic. For further information on the risks and uncertainties associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, see Part I. Item 1A. Risk Factors. We believe that we have sufficient financial resources and liquidity which will enable us to meet our ongoing working capital and other cash flow needs. Subsequent to fiscal year end 2021, Tyco Electronics Group S.A. TEGSA called for the early redemption of all of its outstanding 3.50 senior notes due in February 2022, representing 500 million aggregate principal amount. The redemption, which was funded with cash from operations, was completed in November 2021. As of fiscal year end 2021, our cash and cash equivalents were held in subsidiaries which are located in various countries throughout the world. Under current applicable laws, substantially all of these amounts can be repatriated to TEGSA, our Luxembourg subsidiary, which is the obligor of substantially all of our debt, and to TE Connectivity Ltd., our Swiss parent company; however, the repatriation of these amounts could subject us to additional tax expense. We provide for tax liabilities on the Consolidated Financial Statements with respect to amounts that we expect to repatriate; however, no tax liabilities are recorded for amounts that we consider to be retained indefinitely and reinvested in our global manufacturing operations. As of fiscal year end 2021, we had approximately 4.9 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and intercompany deposits, principally in our subsidiaries, that we have the ability to distribute to TEGSA and TE Connectivity Ltd. but we consider to be permanently reinvested. We estimate that up to 0.7 billion of tax expense would be recognized on the Consolidated Financial Statements if our intention to permanently reinvest these amounts were to change. Our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate cash, cash equivalents, and intercompany deposits that are designated as permanently reinvested in order to fund our operations, including investing and financing activities. Cash Flows from Operating Activities Net cash provided by continuing operating activities increased 685 million to 2,676 million in fiscal 2021 as compared to 1,991 million in fiscal 2020. The increase resulted primarily from higher pre-tax income, partially offset by higher working capital levels to support increased sales and higher tax payments. The amount of income taxes paid, net of refunds, during fiscal 2021 and 2020 was 371 million and 257 million, respectively.

Table of Contents 
 Pension contributions were 61 million and 47 million in fiscal 2021 and 2020, respectively. We expect pension contributions to be 50 million in fiscal 2022, before consideration of any voluntary contributions. For additional information regarding pensions, see Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Cash Flows from Investing Activities Capital expenditures were 690 million and 560 million in fiscal 2021 and 2020, respectively. We expect fiscal 2022 capital spending levels to be approximately 5 of net sales. We believe our capital funding levels are adequate to support new programs, and we continue to invest in our manufacturing infrastructure to further enhance productivity and manufacturing capabilities. During fiscal 2021, we acquired four businesses for a combined cash purchase price of 422 million, net of cash acquired. We acquired five businesses, including First Sensor, for a combined cash purchase price of 336 million, net of cash acquired, during fiscal 2020. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding acquisitions. Cash Flows from Financing Activities and Capitalization Total debt at fiscal year end 2021 and 2020 was 4,092 million and 4,146 million, respectively. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding debt. During fiscal 2021, TEGSA, our wholly-owned subsidiary, issued 550 million aggregate principal amount of 0.00 senior notes due in February 2029. The notes are TEGSA s unsecured senior obligations and rank equally in right of payment with all existing and any future senior indebtedness of TEGSA and senior to any subordinated indebtedness that TEGSA may incur. TEGSA has a five-year unsecured senior revolving credit facility Credit Facility with total commitments of 1.5 billion. The Credit Facility contains provisions that allow for incremental commitments of up to 500 million, an option to temporarily increase the financial ratio covenant following a qualified acquisition, and borrowings in designated currencies. The Credit Facility was amended in June 2021 primarily to extend the maturity date from November 2023 to June 2026. The amended Credit Facility contains customary provisions for the replacement of London Interbank Offered Rate LIBOR with successor rates and amends certain representations, warranties, and covenants applicable to us and TEGSA as obligors under the credit agreement. TEGSA had no borrowings under the Credit Facility at fiscal year end 2021 or 2020. Borrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest at a rate per annum equal to, at the option of TEGSA, (1) LIBOR or, upon a phase-out of LIBOR, an alternative benchmark rate, (2) an alternate base rate equal to the highest of (i) Bank of America, N.A. s base rate, (ii) the federal funds effective rate plus 1 / 2 of 1 , and (iii) one-month LIBOR, or an alternative benchmark rate, plus 1 , (3) an alternative currency daily rate, or (4) an alternative currency term rate, plus, in each case, an applicable margin based upon the senior, unsecured, long-term debt rating of TEGSA. TEGSA is required to pay an annual facility fee. Based on the applicable credit ratings of TEGSA, this fee ranges from 5.0 to 12.5 basis points of the lenders commitments under the Credit Facility. The Credit Facility contains a financial ratio covenant providing that if, as of the last day of each fiscal quarter, our ratio of Consolidated Total Debt to Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the Credit Facility) for the then most recently concluded period of four consecutive fiscal quarters exceeds 3.75 to 1.0, an Event of Default (as defined in the Credit Facility) is triggered. The Credit Facility and our other debt agreements contain other customary covenants. None of our covenants are presently considered restrictive to our operations. As of fiscal year end 2021, we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants and believe that we will continue to be in compliance with our existing covenants for the foreseeable future. Periodically, TEGSA issues commercial paper to U.S. institutional accredited investors and qualified institutional buyers in accordance with available exemptions from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933 as part of our ongoing effort to maintain financial flexibility and to potentially decrease the cost of borrowings. Borrowings under the commercial paper program are backed by the Credit Facility. TEGSA had no borrowings under the commercial paper program at fiscal year end 2021 or 2020. TEGSA s payment obligations under its senior notes, commercial paper, and Credit Facility are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on an unsecured basis by its parent, TE Connectivity Ltd.

 Payments of common share dividends to shareholders were 647 million and 625 million in fiscal 2021 and 2020, respectively. See Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding dividends on our common shares. In March 2021, our shareholders approved a dividend payment to shareholders of 2.00 per share, payable in four equal quarterly installments of 0.50 per share beginning in the third quarter of fiscal 2021 and ending in the second quarter of fiscal 2022. Future dividends on our common shares, if any, must be approved by our shareholders. In exercising their discretion to recommend to the shareholders that such dividends be approved, our board of directors will consider our results of operations, cash requirements and surplus, financial condition, statutory requirements of applicable law, contractual restrictions, and other factors that they may deem relevant. In fiscal 2021, our board of directors authorized an increase of 1.5 billion in our share repurchase program. We repurchased approximately 7 million of our common shares for 904 million and approximately 6 million of our common shares for 505 million under the share repurchase program during fiscal 2021 and 2020, respectively. At fiscal year end 2021, we had 1.6 billion of availability remaining under our share repurchase authorization. Summarized Guarantor Financial Information As discussed above, our senior notes, commercial paper, and Credit Facility are issued by TEGSA and are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on an unsecured basis by TEGSA s parent, TE Connectivity Ltd. In addition to being the issuer of our debt securities, TEGSA owns, directly or indirectly, all of our operating subsidiaries. The following tables present summarized financial information, excluding investments in and equity in earnings of our non-guarantor subsidiaries, for TE Connectivity Ltd. and TEGSA on a combined basis.

(2) Includes 8,832 million and 20,016 million as of fiscal year end 2021and 2020, respectively, of intercompany loans payable to non-guarantor subsidiaries. 

Fiscal 2021 2020 (in millions) Statement of Operations Data: Loss from continuing operations (485) (206) Net loss (479) (202) Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements In certain instances, we have guaranteed the performance of third parties and provided financial guarantees for uncompleted work and financial commitments. The terms of these guarantees vary with end dates ranging from fiscal 2022 through the completion of such transactions. The guarantees would be triggered in the event of nonperformance, and the potential exposure for nonperformance under the guarantees would not have a material effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. In disposing of assets or businesses, we often provide representations, warranties, and/or indemnities to cover various risks including unknown damage to assets, environmental risks involved in the sale of real estate, liability for 
 34

 investigation and remediation of environmental contamination at waste disposal sites and manufacturing facilities, and unidentified tax liabilities and legal fees related to periods prior to disposition. We do not expect that these uncertainties will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. At fiscal year end 2021, we had outstanding letters of credit, letters of guarantee, and surety bonds of 135 million, excluding those related to our Subsea Communications SubCom business which are discussed below. During fiscal 2019, we sold our SubCom business. In connection with the sale, we contractually agreed to continue to honor performance guarantees and letters of credit related to the SubCom business projects that existed as of the date of sale. These performance guarantees and letters of credit had a combined value of approximately 119 million as of fiscal year end 2021 and are expected to expire at various dates through fiscal 2025. During fiscal 2021, we amended our agreement with SubCom and removed a requirement to issue new performance guarantees for certain projects entered into by the SubCom business following the sale. As of fiscal year end 2021, there were no such new performance guarantees outstanding. We have contractual recourse against the SubCom business if we are required to perform on any SubCom guarantees; however, based on historical experience, we do not anticipate having to perform. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the divestiture of the SubCom business. Commitments and Contingencies The following table provides a summary of our contractual obligations and commitments for debt, minimum lease payment obligations under non-cancelable leases, and other material obligations at fiscal year end 2021: Payments Due by Fiscal Year Total 2022 2023 2024 2025 2026 Thereafter (in millions) Debt (1) 4,119 503 651 353 646 352 1,614 Interest payments on debt (2) 758 84 80 72 60 54 408 Operating leases (3) 468 118 104 83 63 40 60 Purchase obligations (4) 1,063 1,041 17 2 3 Total contractual cash obligations (5)(6) 6,408 1,746 852 510 769 446 2,085 

 (1) Debt represents principal payments. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding debt. (2) Interest payments exclude the impact of our interest rate swap and cross-currency swap contracts. Interest payments on debt are projected for future periods using rates in effect as of fiscal year end 2021 and are subject to change in future periods. (3) Operating leases represents the undiscounted lease payments. See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding leases. (4) Purchase obligations consist primarily of commitments for purchases of goods and services. (5) The above table does not reflect unrecognized income tax benefits of 359 million and related accrued interest and penalties of 53 million, the timing of which is uncertain. See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding unrecognized income tax benefits, interest, and penalties. (6) The above table does not reflect pension obligations to certain employees and former employees. We are obligated to make contributions to our pension plans; however, we are unable to determine the amount of plan contributions due to the inherent uncertainties of obligations of this type, including timing, interest rate charges, investment performance, and amounts of benefit payments. We expect to contribute 50 million to pension plans in fiscal 2022, before consideration of any voluntary contributions. See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding these plans and our estimates of future contributions and benefit payments. 
 Legal Proceedings In the normal course of business, we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims, including patent infringement claims, product liability matters, employment disputes, disputes on agreements, other commercial disputes, environmental matters, antitrust claims, and tax matters, including non-income tax matters such as value added tax, sales and use tax, real estate tax, and transfer tax. Although it is not feasible to predict the outcome of these proceedings, based upon 
 35 

Table of Contents 
 our experience, current information, and applicable law, we do not expect that the outcome of these proceedings, either individually or in the aggregate, will have a material effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. Trade Compliance Matters We are investigating our past compliance with relevant U.S. trade controls and have made voluntary disclosures of apparent trade controls violations to the U.S. Department of Commerce s Bureau of Industry and Security BIS and the U.S. State Department s Directorate of Defense Trade Controls DDTC ). We are cooperating with the BIS and DDTC on these matters, and both our internal assessment and the resulting investigations by the agencies remain ongoing. We are unable to predict the timing and final outcome of the agencies investigations. An unfavorable outcome may include fines or penalties imposed in response to our disclosures, but we are not yet able to reasonably estimate the extent of any such fines or penalties. While we have reserved for potential fines and penalties relating to these matters based on our current understanding of the facts, the investigations into these matters have yet to be completed and the final outcome of such investigations and related fines and penalties may differ from amounts currently reserved. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses. Our significant accounting policies are summarized in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We believe the following accounting policies are the most critical as they require significant judgments and assumptions that involve inherent risks and uncertainties. Management s estimates are based on the relevant information available at the end of each period. Revenue Recognition We account for revenue in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers . Our revenues are generated principally from the sale of our products. Revenue is recognized as performance obligations under the terms of a contract, such as a purchase order with a customer, are satisfied; generally this occurs with the transfer of control. We transfer control and recognize revenue when we ship product to our customers, the customers accept and have legal title for the product, and we have a right to payment for such product. Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration that we expect to receive in exchange for those products and excludes taxes assessed by governmental authorities and collected from customers concurrent with the sale of products. Shipping and handling costs are treated as fulfillment costs and are included in cost of sales. Since we typically invoice our customers when we satisfy our performance obligations, we do not have material contract assets or contract liabilities. Our credit terms are customary and do not contain significant financing components that extend beyond one year of fulfillment of performance obligations. We apply the practical expedient of ASC 606 with respect to financing components and do not evaluate contracts in which payment is due within one year of satisfaction of the related performance obligation. Since our performance obligations to deliver products are part of contracts that generally have original durations of one year or less, we have elected to use the optional exemption to not disclose the aggregate amount of transaction prices associated with unsatisfied or partially satisfied performance obligations. We generally warrant that our products will conform to our, or mutually agreed to, specifications and that our products will be free from material defects in materials and workmanship for a limited time. We limit our warranty to the replacement or repair of defective parts, or a refund or credit of the price of the defective product. We do not account for these warranties as separate performance obligations. Although products are generally sold at fixed prices, certain distributors and customers receive incentives or awards, such as sales rebates, return allowances, scrap allowances, and other rights, which are accounted for as variable consideration. We estimate these amounts in the same period revenue is recognized based on the expected value to be provided to customers and reduce revenue accordingly. Our estimates of variable consideration and ultimate determination of the estimated amounts to include in the transaction price are based primarily on our assessment of anticipated performance and historical and forecasted information that is reasonably available to us. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets We account for goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with ASC 350, Intangibles Goodwill and Other . 
 36 

Table of Contents 
 Intangible assets include both indeterminable-lived residual goodwill and determinable-lived identifiable intangible assets. Intangible assets with determinable lives primarily include intellectual property, consisting of patents, trademarks, and unpatented technology, and customer relationships. Recoverability estimates range from 1 to 50 years and costs are generally amortized on a straight-line basis. Evaluations of the remaining useful lives of determinable-lived intangible assets are performed on a periodic basis and when events and circumstances warrant. We test for goodwill impairment at the reporting unit level. A reporting unit is generally an operating segment or one level below an operating segment (a component if the component constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available and regularly reviewed by segment management. At fiscal year end 2021, we had five reporting units, all of which contained goodwill. There were two reporting units in both the Transportation Solutions and Industrial Solutions segments and one reporting unit in the Communications Solutions segment. When changes occur in the composition of one or more reporting units, goodwill is reassigned to the reporting units affected based on their relative fair values. We review our reporting unit structure each year as part of our annual goodwill impairment test, or more frequently based on changes in our structure. Goodwill impairment is evaluated by comparing the carrying value of each reporting unit to its fair value on the first day of the fourth fiscal quarter of each year or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired. In assessing a potential impairment, management relies on several reporting unit-specific factors including operating results, business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows, transactions, and marketplace data. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and management s judgment in applying these factors to the impairment analysis. When testing for goodwill impairment, we identify potential impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, a goodwill impairment charge will be recorded for the amount of the excess, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. Fair value estimates used in the goodwill impairment tests are calculated using an income approach based on the present value of future cash flows of each reporting unit. The income approach is supported by a guideline analysis (a market approach). These approaches incorporate several assumptions including future growth rates, discount rates, income tax rates, and market activity in assessing fair value and are reporting unit specific. Changes in economic and operating conditions impacting these assumptions could result in goodwill impairments in future periods. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding our interim goodwill impairment test and partial impairment charge of 900 million recorded in the second quarter of fiscal 2020. We completed our annual goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 and determined that no impairment existed. Income Taxes In determining income for financial statement purposes, we must make certain estimates and judgments. These estimates and judgments affect the calculation of certain tax liabilities and the determination of the recoverability of certain deferred tax assets, which arise from temporary differences between the income tax return and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense. In evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets, we consider all available positive and negative evidence including our past operating results, the existence of cumulative losses in the most recent years, and our forecast of taxable income. In estimating future taxable income, we develop assumptions including the amount of pre-tax operating income in various tax jurisdictions, the reversal of temporary differences, and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies. These assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses. We currently have recorded significant valuation allowances that we intend to maintain until it is more likely than not the deferred tax assets will be realized. Our income tax expense recorded in the future will be reduced to the extent of decreases in our valuation allowances. The realization of our remaining deferred tax assets is dependent primarily on future taxable income in the appropriate jurisdictions. Any reduction in future taxable income including any future restructuring activities may require that we record an additional valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets. An increase in the valuation allowance would result in additional income tax expense in such period and could have a significant impact on our future earnings.

 Changes in tax laws and rates also could affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future. Management is not aware of any enacted changes that would have a material effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. The calculation of our tax liabilities includes estimates for uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations across multiple global jurisdictions where we conduct our operations. Under the uncertain tax position provisions of ASC 740, Income Taxes , we recognize liabilities for tax and related interest for issues in tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes and related interest will be due. These tax liabilities and related interest are reflected net of the impact of related tax loss carryforwards, as such tax loss carryforwards will be applied against these tax liabilities and will reduce the amount of cash tax payments due upon the eventual settlement with the tax authorities. These estimates may change due to changing facts and circumstances. Due to the complexity of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a settlement that differs from our current estimate of the tax liabilities and related interest. These tax liabilities and related interest are recorded in income taxes and accrued and other current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Pension Plans Our defined benefit pension plan expense and obligations are developed from actuarial assumptions. The funded status of our plans is recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and is measured as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the projected benefit obligation at the measurement date. The projected benefit obligation represents the actuarial present value of benefits projected to be paid upon retirement factoring in estimated future compensation levels. The fair value of plan assets represents the current market value of cumulative company and participant contributions made to irrevocable trust funds, held for the sole benefit of participants, which are invested by the trustee of the funds. The benefits under our defined benefit pension plans are based on various factors, such as years of service and compensation. Net periodic pension benefit cost is based on the utilization of the projected unit credit method of calculation and is charged to earnings on a systematic basis over the expected average remaining service lives of current participants, or, for inactive plans, over the remaining life expectancy of participants. Two critical assumptions in determining pension expense and obligations are the discount rate and expected long-term return on plan assets. We evaluate these assumptions at least annually. Other assumptions reflect demographic factors such as retirement, mortality, and employee turnover. These assumptions are evaluated periodically and updated to reflect our actual experience. Actual results may differ from actuarial assumptions. The discount rate represents the market rate for high-quality fixed income investments and is used to calculate the present value of the expected future cash flows for benefit obligations to be paid under our pension plans. A decrease in the discount rate increases the present value of pension benefit obligations. At fiscal year end 2021, a 25-basis-point decrease in the discount rate would have increased the present value of our pension obligations by 127 million; a 25-basis-point increase would have decreased the present value of our pension obligations by 119 million. We consider the current and expected asset allocations of our pension plans, as well as historical and expected long-term rates of return on those types of plan assets, in determining the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. A 50-basis-point decrease or increase in the expected long-term return on plan assets would have increased or decreased, respectively, our fiscal 2021 pension expense by 13 million. At fiscal year end 2021, the long-term target asset allocation in our U.S. plans master trust is 5 return-seeking assets and 95 liability-hedging assets. Asset re-allocation to meet that target is occurring over a multi-year period based on the funded status. We expect to reach our target allocation when the funded status of the plans exceeds 115 . Based on the funded status of the plans as of fiscal year end 2021, our target asset allocation is 67 return-seeking and 33 liability-hedging. Non-GAAP Financial Measure Organic Net Sales Growth (Decline) We present organic net sales growth (decline) as we believe it is appropriate for investors to consider this adjusted financial measure in addition to results in accordance with GAAP. Organic net sales growth (decline) represents net sales growth (decline) (the most comparable GAAP financial measure) excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rates, and acquisitions and divestitures that occurred in the preceding twelve months, if any. Organic net sales growth (decline) is a useful measure of our performance because it excludes items that are not completely under management s control, such as the 
 38 

Table of Contents 
 impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, and items that do not reflect the underlying growth of the company, such as acquisition and divestiture activity. Organic net sales growth (decline) provides useful information about our results and the trends of our business. Management uses this measure to monitor and evaluate performance. Also, management uses this measure together with GAAP financial measures in its decision-making processes related to the operations of our reportable segments and our overall company. It is also a significant component in our incentive compensation plans. We believe that investors benefit from having access to the same financial measures that management uses in evaluating operations. The tables presented in Results of Operations and Segment Results provide reconciliations of organic net sales growth (decline) to net sales growth (decline) calculated in accordance with GAAP. Organic net sales growth (decline) is a non-GAAP financial measure and should not be considered a replacement for results in accordance with GAAP. This non-GAAP financial measure may not be comparable to similarly-titled measures reported by other companies. The primary limitation of this measure is that it excludes the financial impact of items that would otherwise either increase or decrease our reported results. This limitation is best addressed by using organic net sales growth (decline) in combination with net sales growth (decline) to better understand the amounts, character, and impact of any increase or decrease in reported amounts. Forward-Looking Information Certain statements in this Annual Report are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are based on our management s beliefs and assumptions and on information currently available to our management. Forward-looking statements include, among others, the information concerning our possible or assumed future results of operations, business strategies, financing plans, competitive position, potential growth opportunities, potential operating performance improvements, acquisitions, divestitures, the effects of competition, and the effects of future legislation or regulations. Forward-looking statements include all statements that are not historical facts and can be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology such as the words believe, expect, plan, intend, anticipate, estimate, predict, potential, continue, may, and should, or the negative of these terms or similar expressions. Forward-looking statements involve risks, uncertainties, and assumptions. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements. Investors should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements. We do not have any intention or obligation to update forward-looking statements after we file this report except as required by law. The following and other risks, which are described in greater detail in Part I. Item 1A. Risk Factors, as well as other risks described in this Annual Report, could cause our results to differ materially from those expressed in forward- looking statements: conditions in the global or regional economies and global capital markets, and cyclical industry conditions; conditions affecting demand for products in the industries we serve, particularly the automotive industry; risk of future goodwill impairment; competition and pricing pressure; market acceptance of our new product introductions and product innovations and product life cycles; raw material availability, quality, and cost; fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and impacts of offsetting hedges; financial condition and consolidation of customers and vendors; reliance on third-party suppliers; 
 39 

Table of Contents 
 risks associated with current and future acquisitions and divestitures; global risks of business interruptions due to natural disasters or other disasters such as the COVID-19 pandemic, which have impacted and could continue to negatively impact our results of operations as well as customer behaviors, business, and manufacturing operations as well as our facilities and the facilities of our suppliers, and other aspects of our business; global risks of political, economic, and military instability, including volatile and uncertain economic conditions in China; risks associated with security breaches and other disruptions to our information technology infrastructure; risks related to compliance with current and future environmental and other laws and regulations; risks associated with compliance with applicable antitrust or competition laws or applicable trade regulations; our ability to protect our intellectual property rights; risks of litigation; our ability to operate within the limitations imposed by our debt instruments; the possible effects on us of various non-U.S. and U.S. legislative proposals and other initiatives that, if adopted, could materially increase our worldwide corporate effective tax rate, increase global cash taxes, and negatively impact our U.S. government contracts business; various risks associated with being a Swiss corporation; the impact of fluctuations in the market price of our shares; and the impact of certain provisions of our articles of association on unsolicited takeover proposals. 
 There may be other risks and uncertainties that we are unable to predict at this time or that we currently do not expect to have a material adverse effect on our business. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK In the normal course of business, our financial position is routinely subject to a variety of risks, including market risks associated with interest rate and foreign currency movements on outstanding debt and non-U.S. dollar denominated assets and liabilities and commodity price movements. We utilize established risk management policies and procedures in executing derivative financial instrument transactions to manage a portion of these risks. We do not execute transactions or hold derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Substantially all counterparties to derivative financial instruments are limited to major financial institutions with at least an A/A2 credit rating. There is no significant concentration of exposures with any one counterparty. Foreign Currency Exposures As part of managing the exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, we utilize cross-currency swap contracts and foreign currency forward contracts, a portion of which are designated as cash flow hedges. The objective of these contracts is to minimize impacts to cash flows and profitability due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates on intercompany and other cash transactions. In addition, we utilize cross-currency swap contracts to hedge our net investment in certain foreign operations. A 10 appreciation or depreciation of the underlying currency in our cross-currency swap contracts or foreign currency forward contracts from the fiscal year end 2021 market rates would have changed the unrealized value of our contracts by 240 million. A 10 appreciation or depreciation of the underlying currency in our cross-currency swap contracts or foreign currency forward contracts from the fiscal year end 2020 market rates would have changed the 
 40 

Table of Contents 
 unrealized value of our contracts by 265 million. Such gains or losses on these contracts would generally be offset by the losses or gains on the revaluation or settlement of the underlying transactions. Interest Rate and Investment Exposures We issue debt, as needed, to fund our operations and capital requirements. Such borrowings can result in interest rate exposure. To manage the interest rate exposure, we use interest rate swap contracts to convert a portion of fixed rate debt into variable rate debt. Based on our floating rate debt balance at fiscal year end 2020, a 50-basis-point increase in the levels of the U.S. dollar interest rates, with all other variables held constant, would have resulted in an immaterial increase in interest expense in fiscal 2020. There was no floating rate debt outstanding at fiscal year end 2021. We may use forward starting interest rate swap contracts to manage interest rate exposure in periods prior to the anticipated issuance of fixed rate debt. At fiscal year end 2021 and 2020, we had forward starting interest rate swap contracts which had an aggregate notional value of 450 million and were designated as cash flow hedges. We utilize investment swap contracts to manage earnings exposure on certain nonqualified deferred compensation liabilities. Commodity Exposures Our worldwide operations and product lines may expose us to risks from fluctuations in commodity prices. To limit the effects of fluctuations in the future market price paid and related volatility in cash flows, we utilize commodity swap contracts designated as cash flow hedges. We continually evaluate the commodity market with respect to our forecasted usage requirements over the next eighteen months and periodically enter into commodity swap contracts to hedge a portion of usage requirements over that period. At fiscal year end 2021, our commodity hedges, which related to expected purchases of gold, silver, copper, and palladium, were in a net gain position of 1 million and had a notional value of 512 million. At fiscal year end 2020, our commodity hedges, which related to expected purchases of gold, silver, copper, and palladium, were in a net gain position of 41 million and had a notional value of 312 million. A 10 appreciation or depreciation of commodity prices from the fiscal year end 2021 prices would have changed the unrealized value of our forward contracts by 51 million. A 10 appreciation or depreciation of commodity prices from the fiscal year end 2020 prices would have changed the unrealized value of our forward contracts by 35 million. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding financial instruments.

 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of TE Connectivity Ltd. Opinion on the Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of TE Connectivity Ltd. and subsidiaries (the Company as of September 24, 2021 and September 25, 2020, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), shareholders equity, and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended September 24, 2021, and the related notes and the schedule listed in the Index at Item 15 (collectively referred to as the financial statements ). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of September 24, 2021 and September 25, 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 24, 2021, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of September 24, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated November 9, 2021, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Change in Accounting Principle As discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, effective September 28, 2019, the Company adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Update 2016-02 which codified Accounting Standards Codification 842, Leases , using the modified retrospective approach. Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit Matters The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.

 Goodwill Sensors Reporting Unit within the Transportation Solutions Reportable Segment Refer to Notes 2 and 8 to the financial statements Critical Audit Matter Description The Company s evaluation of goodwill for impairment involves comparing the carrying amount of each reporting unit to its fair value on the first day of the fourth fiscal quarter or whenever the Company believes an event or other change in reporting unit structure requiring a more frequent assessment has occurred. The Company uses the income approach based on the present value of future cash flows to estimate fair value. The income approach is supported by guideline analyses (a market approach). These approaches incorporate several assumptions including future growth rates, discount rates, and market activity in assessing fair value and are reporting unit specific. The goodwill balance was 5.6 billion as of September 24, 2021, of which 0.3 billion was allocated to the Sensors reporting unit within the Transportation Solutions reportable segment. The fair value of this reporting unit exceeded its carrying amount, therefore, no impairment was recognized. We identified goodwill for the Sensors reporting unit as a critical audit matter because of the significant judgments made by management to estimate its fair value, especially considering the partial impairment charge recorded in the prior fiscal year and future revenue growth rates were based on an expectation of an increase in net sales in a product portfolio with limited available third-party industry reports. This required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort, including the need to involve our fair value specialists, when performing audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of management s estimates and assumptions related to forecasts of future revenue and operating margin and the selection of discount rates. How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit Our audit procedures related to the forecasts of future revenue and operating margin (the forecasts ), and the selection of discount rates for the Sensors reporting unit included the following, among others: 
 We tested the effectiveness of controls over management s goodwill impairment evaluation, including those over the determination of the fair value, such as controls related to forecasts and management s selection of discount rates. We evaluated management s ability to accurately forecast future revenue and operating margin by comparing actual results to management s historical forecasts. We evaluated the reasonableness of management s forecasts by comparing the forecasts to: 
 
 Historical operating results of the reporting unit. Historical operating results of the Company s other reporting units. Internal communications to management and the board of directors. External communications made by management to analysts and investors. Third-party industry reports for similar products. 
 
 With the assistance of our fair value specialists, we evaluated the reasonableness of the (1) valuation methodology and (2) discount rates by: 
 
 Testing the source information underlying the determination of the discount rates and the mathematical accuracy of the calculations. Developing a range of independent estimates and comparing those to the discount rates selected by management. 
 Income Taxes Realizability of Deferred Tax Assets Refer to Notes 2 and 16 to the financial statements Critical Audit Matter Description The Company recognizes deferred income taxes for temporary differences between the amount of assets and liabilities recognized for financial reporting and tax purposes. A valuation allowance is provided to offset deferred tax assets if, based upon the available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Future realization of deferred tax assets depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character prior to expiration. Sources of taxable income include future reversals of deferred tax assets and liabilities, expected future taxable income, taxable income in prior carryback years if permitted under the tax law, and tax planning strategies.

Table of Contents 
 Management has determined that it is more likely than not that sufficient taxable income will be generated in the future to realize a portion of its deferred tax assets, and therefore, a valuation allowance of 2.7 billion has been recorded to offset the Company s gross deferred tax assets as of September 24, 2021 of 5.3 billion. We identified the realizability of deferred tax assets as a critical audit matter because of the Company s tax structure and the significant judgments and estimates made by management to determine that sufficient taxable income will be generated in the future prior to expiration to realize a portion of its deferred tax assets. This required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort, including the need to involve our income tax specialists, when performing audit procedures to evaluate the appropriateness of qualifying tax planning strategies and the reasonableness of management s estimates of taxable income prior to expiration. How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit Our audit procedures related to the determination that it is more likely than not that sufficient taxable income will be generated in the future to realize deferred tax assets included the following, among others: 
 We tested the effectiveness of controls over management s estimates of the realization of the deferred tax assets, including those over the estimates of taxable income, the approval of tax planning strategies and the determination of whether it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized prior to expiration. We evaluated the reasonableness of management s assessment of the significance and weighting of negative evidence and positive evidence that is objectively verifiable. We evaluated management s ability to accurately estimate taxable income by comparing actual results to management s historical estimates and evaluating whether there have been any changes that would impact management s ability to continue accurately estimating taxable income. We tested the reasonableness of management s estimates of taxable income by comparing the estimates to: 
 
 Historical taxable income. Internal communications to management and the board of directors. Management s history of carrying out its stated plans and its ability to carry out its plans considering contractual commitments, available financing, or debt covenants. 
 
 We evaluated whether the estimates of future taxable income were consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit. We evaluated whether the taxable income in prior carryback years was of the appropriate character and available under the tax law. With the assistance of our income tax and other specialists, we evaluated (1) the appropriateness of qualifying tax planning strategies, including that they were prudent, feasible and would more likely than not result in the realization of deferred tax assets and (2) management s assessment that sufficient taxable income will be generated in the future to realize a portion of the deferred tax assets prior to expiration.

 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of TE Connectivity Ltd. Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of TE Connectivity Ltd. and subsidiaries (the Company as of September 24, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 24, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the financial statements as of and for the fiscal year ended September 24, 2021, of the Company and our report dated November 9, 2021 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements. Basis for Opinion The Company s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ Deloitte Touche LLP Philadelphia, Pennsylvania November 9, 2021

 of satisfaction of the related performance obligation. Since our performance obligations to deliver products are part of contracts that generally have original durations of or less, we have elected to use the optional exemption to not disclose the aggregate amount of transaction prices associated with unsatisfied or partially satisfied performance obligations. See Note 21 for net sales disaggregated by industry end market and geographic region which is summarized by segment and that we consider meaningful to depict the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows affected by economic factors. We generally warrant that our products will conform to our, or mutually agreed to, specifications and that our products will be free from material defects in materials and workmanship for a limited time. We limit our warranty to the replacement or repair of defective parts, or a refund or credit of the price of the defective product. We do not account for these warranties as separate performance obligations. Although products are generally sold at fixed prices, certain distributors and customers receive incentives or awards, such as sales rebates, return allowances, scrap allowances, and other rights, which are accounted for as variable consideration. We estimate these amounts in the same period revenue is recognized based on the expected value to be provided to customers and reduce revenue accordingly. Our estimates of variable consideration and ultimate determination of the estimated amounts to include in the transaction price are based primarily on our assessment of anticipated performance and historical and forecasted information that is reasonably available to us. for land improvements, 5 to for buildings and improvements, and 1 to for machinery and equipment. We periodically evaluate, when events and circumstances warrant, the net realizable value of property, plant, and equipment and other long-lived assets, relying on several factors including operating results, business plans, economic projections, and anticipated future cash flows. When indicators of potential impairment are present, the carrying values of the asset group are evaluated in relation to the operating performance and estimated future undiscounted cash flows of the underlying asset group. Impairment of the carrying value is recognized whenever anticipated future undiscounted cash flow estimates are less than the carrying value of the asset. Fair value estimates are based on assumptions concerning the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows and discount rates, reflecting varying degrees of perceived risk. to and costs are generally amortized on a straight-line basis. Evaluations of the remaining useful lives of determinable-lived intangible assets are performed on a periodic basis and when events and circumstances warrant.

 reporting units, all of which contained goodwill. There were reporting units in both the Transportation Solutions and Industrial Solutions segments and reporting unit in the Communications Solutions segment. When changes occur in the composition of one or more reporting units, goodwill is reassigned to the reporting units affected based on their relative fair values. Goodwill impairment is evaluated by comparing the carrying value of each reporting unit to its fair value on the first day of the fourth fiscal quarter of each year or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired. In assessing a potential impairment, management relies on several reporting unit-specific factors including operating results, business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows, transactions, and marketplace data. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and management s judgment in applying these factors to the impairment analysis. When testing for goodwill impairment, we identify potential impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, a goodwill impairment charge will be recorded for the amount of the excess, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. Fair value estimates used in the goodwill impairment tests are calculated using an income approach based on the present value of future cash flows of each reporting unit. The income approach is supported by a guideline analysis (a market approach). These approaches incorporate several assumptions including future growth rates, discount rates, income tax rates, and market activity in assessing fair value and are reporting unit specific. Changes in economic and operating conditions impacting these assumptions could result in goodwill impairments in future periods. million, million, and million, respectively.

Many of these costs are variable, fluctuating based on services provided, such as pallets shipped in and out of a location or square footage of space occupied. These costs, and any other variable rental costs, are excluded from our ROU assets and lease liabilities, and instead are expensed as incurred. Some of our leases may include options to either renew or early the lease.

 Other liabilities Restructuring reserves million and incurred a pre-tax loss on sale of million, related primarily to the recognition of cumulative translation adjustment losses of million and the guarantee liabilities discussed below. The sale of the SubCom business, which was previously included in our Communications Solutions segment, represented our exit from the telecommunications market and was significant to our sales and profitability, both to the Communications Solutions segment and to the consolidated company. We concluded that the divestiture was a strategic shift that had a major effect on our operations and financial results. As a result, the SubCom business met the held for sale and discontinued operations criteria and has been reported as such in all periods presented on our Consolidated Financial Statements. In connection with the sale, we contractually agreed to continue to honor performance guarantees and letters of credit related to the SubCom business projects that existed as of the date of sale. These performance guarantees and letters of credit had a combined value of approximately million as of fiscal year end 2021 and are expected to expire at various dates through fiscal 2025. At the time of sale, we determined that the fair value of these guarantees was million, which we recognized by a charge to pre-tax loss on sale. During fiscal 2021, we amended our agreement with SubCom and removed a requirement to issue new performance guarantees for certain projects entered into by the SubCom business following the sale. As of fiscal year end 2021, there were no such new performance guarantees outstanding. We have contractual recourse against the SubCom business if we are required to perform on any SubCom guarantees; however, based on historical experience, we do not anticipate having to perform.

 businesses, including First Sensor AG First Sensor ), for a combined cash purchase price of million, net of cash acquired, during fiscal 2020. The acquisitions were reported as part of our Transportation Solutions and Industrial Solutions segments from the date of acquisition. In connection with our acquisition of approximately of the outstanding shares of First Sensor, we and First Sensor entered into a Domination and Profit and Loss Transfer Agreement DPLTA which became effective in fiscal 2020. Under the terms of the DPLTA, First Sensor minority shareholders can elect either (1) to remain First Sensor minority shareholders and receive recurring annual compensation of per First Sensor share or (2) to put their First Sensor shares in exchange for compensation of per First Sensor share. The ultimate amount and timing of any future cash payments related to the DPLTA is uncertain. Our First Sensor noncontrolling interest balance, which was originally recorded at a fair value of million (equivalent to million) at the acquisition date, is recorded as redeemable noncontrolling interest outside of equity on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of fiscal year end 2021 and 2020 as the exercise of the put right by First Sensor minority shareholders is not within our control.

 During fiscal 2021 and 2020, we recognized goodwill of million and million, respectively, in connection with new acquisitions. See Note 5 for additional information regarding acquisitions. We completed our annual goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 and determined that impairment existed. During the quarter ended March 27, 2020, as a result of current and projected declines in sales and profitability of the Sensors reporting unit of the Transportation Solutions segment, due in part to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and projected reductions in global automotive production as of March 2020, we determined that an indicator of impairment had occurred and goodwill impairment testing of this reporting unit was required. We determined the fair value of the Sensors reporting unit to be billion as of March 27, 2020. This valuation was based on a discounted cash flows analysis incorporating our estimate of future operating performance, which we consider to be a level 3 unobservable input in the fair value hierarchy, and was corroborated using a market approach valuation. The goodwill impairment test indicated that the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeded its fair value by million.

 During fiscal 2021, Tyco Electronics Group S.A. TEGSA ), our wholly -owned subsidiary, issued million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due in February 2029. The notes are TEGSA s unsecured senior obligations and rank equally in right of payment with all existing and any future senior indebtedness of TEGSA and senior to any subordinated indebtedness that TEGSA may incur. TEGSA has a unsecured senior revolving credit facility Credit Facility with total commitments of billion. The Credit Facility contains provisions that allow for incremental commitments of up to million, an option to temporarily increase the financial ratio covenant following a qualified acquisition, and borrowings in designated currencies. The Credit Facility was amended in June 2021 primarily to extend the maturity date from November 2023 to June 2026. The amended Credit Facility contains customary provisions for the replacement of London Interbank Offered Rate LIBOR with successor rates and amends certain representations, warranties, and covenants applicable to us and TEGSA as obligors under the credit agreement. TEGSA had borrowings under the Credit Facility at fiscal year end 2021 or 2020. Borrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest at a rate per annum equal to, at the option of TEGSA, (1) LIBOR or, upon a phase-out of LIBOR, an alternative benchmark rate , (2) an alternate base rate equal to the highest of (i) Bank of America , N.A. s base rate, (ii) the federal funds effective rate plus 1 / 2 of 1 , and (iii) one-month LIBOR, or an alternative benchmark rate, plus , (3) an alternative currency daily rate , or (4) an alternative currency term rate , plus, in each case, an applicable margin based upon the senior, unsecured, long-term debt rating of TEGSA. TEGSA is required to pay an annual facility fee. Based on the applicable credit ratings of TEGSA, this fee ranges from to basis points of the lenders commitments under the Credit Facility. The Credit Facility contains a financial ratio covenant providing that if, as of the last day of each fiscal quarter, our ratio of Consolidated Total Debt to Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the Credit Facility) for the then most recently concluded period of consecutive fiscal quarters exceeds 3.75 to 1.0, an Event of Default (as defined in the Credit Facility) is triggered.

We believe that any potential payment of such estimated amounts will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. Guarantees In disposing of assets or businesses, we often provide representations, warranties, and/or indemnities to cover various risks including unknown damage to assets, environmental risks involved in the sale of real estate, liability for investigation and remediation of environmental contamination at waste disposal sites and manufacturing facilities, and unidentified tax liabilities and legal fees related to periods prior to disposition. We do not expect that these uncertainties will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. At fiscal year end 2021, we had outstanding letters of credit, letters of guarantee, and surety bonds of million, excluding those related to our SubCom business which are discussed in Note 4. . During fiscal 2015, we entered into cross-currency swap contracts to reduce our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with certain intercompany loans. The aggregate notional value of these contracts was million at fiscal year end 2021 and 2020. Under the terms of these contracts, which have been designated as cash flow hedges, we make interest payments in euros at per annum and receive interest in U.S. dollars at a weighted-average rate of per annum. Upon maturity in fiscal 2022, we will pay the notional value of the contracts in euros and receive U.S. dollars from our counterparties. In connection with the cross-currency swap contracts, both counterparties to each contract are required to provide cash collateral. These cross-currency swap contracts were recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as follows: Other liabilities

 (1) Gains and losses excluded from the hedging relationship are recognized prospectively in selling, general, and administrative expenses and are offset by losses and gains generated as a result of re-measuring certain intercompany loans to the U.S. dollar. 
 Hedge of Net Investment We hedge our net investment in certain foreign operations using intercompany loans and external borrowings denominated in the same currencies. The aggregate notional value of these hedges was million and million at fiscal year end 2021 and 2020, respectively. We also use a cross-currency swap program to hedge our net investment in certain foreign operations. The aggregate notional value of the contracts under this program was million and million at fiscal year end 2021 and 2020, respectively. Under the terms of these contracts, we receive interest in U.S. dollars at a weighted-average rate of per annum and pay interest. Upon the maturity of these contracts at various dates through fiscal 2025, we will pay the notional value of the contracts in the designated foreign currency and receive U.S. dollars from our counterparties. We are not required to provide collateral for these contracts.

 Interest Rate and Investment Risk Management We issue debt, as needed, to fund our operations and capital requirements. Such borrowings can result in interest rate exposure. To manage the interest rate exposure, we use interest rate swap contracts to convert a portion of fixed rate debt into variable rate debt. We may use forward starting interest rate swap contracts to manage interest rate exposure in periods prior to the anticipated issuance of fixed rate debt. The aggregate notional value of our forward starting interest rate swap

Commodity Hedges As part of managing the exposure to certain commodity price fluctuations, we utilize commodity swap contracts. The objective of these contracts is to minimize impacts to cash flows and profitability due to changes in prices of commodities used in production. These contracts had an aggregate notional value of million and million at fiscal year end 2021 and 2020, respectively, and were designated as cash flow hedges. These commodity swap contracts were recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as follows: Other assets Accrued and other current liabilities Other liabilities The impacts of these commodity swap contracts were as follows: Gains (losses) reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) into cost of sales ) We expect that significantly all of the balance in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) associated with commodity hedges will be reclassified into the Consolidated Statement of Operations within the next .

 As part of our continued effort to manage U.S. pension plan obligations, during the quarter ended September 24, 2021, we transferred approximately million of U.S. pension plan liabilities to an insurance company through the purchase of a group annuity contract funded by a transfer of plan assets totaling approximately million. As a result of this transaction, we recognized a settlement charge of million, which was recorded in net other income (expense) on the Consolidated Statement of Operations. In fiscal 2021, unrecognized actuarial gains recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) were primarily the result of favorable asset performance and higher discount rates for our non-U.S. and U.S. defined benefit pension plans as compared to fiscal 2020. In fiscal 2020, unrecognized actuarial gains recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) were primarily the result of favorable asset performance for our U.S. defined benefit pension plans, partially offset by lower U.S. discount rates and unfavorable asset performance for our non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans as compared to fiscal 2019. In determining the expected return on plan assets, we consider the relative weighting of plan assets by class and individual asset class performance expectations. The investment strategies for non-U.S. and U.S. pension plans are governed locally. Our investment strategy for our pension plans is to manage the plans on a going concern basis. Current investment policy is to achieve a reasonable return on assets, subject to a prudent level of portfolio risk, for the purpose of enhancing the security of benefits for participants. Projected returns are based primarily on pro forma asset allocation, expected long-term returns, and forward-looking estimates of active portfolio and investment management. At fiscal year end 2021, the long-term target asset allocation in our U.S. plans master trust is return-seeking assets and liability-hedging assets. Return-seeking assets, including non-U.S. and U.S. equity securities, are assets intended to generate returns in excess of pension liability growth. Liability-hedging assets, including government and corporate bonds, are assets intended to have characteristics similar to pension liabilities and are used to better match asset cash flows with expected obligation cash flows. Asset re-allocation to meet that target is occurring over a multi-year period based on the funded status. We expect to reach our target allocation when the funded status of the plans exceeds . Based on the funded status of the plans as of fiscal year end 2021, our target asset allocation is return-seeking and liability-hedging.

The aggregate amount of our common shares would not be considered material relative to the total pension fund assets. Our funding policy is to make contributions in accordance with the laws and customs of the various countries in which we operate as well as to make discretionary voluntary contributions from time to time. We expect to make the minimum required contributions of million and million to our non-U.S. and U.S. pension plans, respectively, in fiscal 2022. We may also make voluntary contributions at our discretion.

Insurance contracts are valued using cash surrender value, or face value of the contract if a cash surrender value is unavailable (level 2), as these values represent the amount that the plan would receive on termination of the underlying contract. Derivatives, short-term investments, and structured products are marked to fair value using models that are supported by observable market-based data (level 2). Real estate investments include investments in commingled real estate funds and are valued at net asset value which is calculated using unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity (level 3). Hedge funds are valued at their net asset value which is calculated using unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity (level 3).

 Fiscal 2021 and 2020 changes in Level 3 assets in non-U.S. plans were primarily the result of investment sales and net investment losses, respectively. Defined Contribution Retirement Plans We maintain several defined contribution retirement plans, the most significant of which is located in the U.S. These plans include 401(k) matching programs, as well as qualified and nonqualified profit sharing and share bonus retirement plans. Expense for the defined contribution plans is computed as a percentage of participants compensation and was million, million, and million for fiscal 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. Deferred Compensation Plans We maintain nonqualified deferred compensation plans, which permit eligible employees to defer a portion of their compensation. A record-keeping account is set up for each participant and the participant chooses from a variety of measurement funds for the deemed investment of their accounts. The measurement funds correspond to several funds in our 401(k) plans and the account balance fluctuates with the investment returns on those funds. At fiscal year end 2021 and 2020, total deferred compensation liabilities were million and million, respectively, and were recorded in other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. See Note 14 for additional information regarding our risk management strategy related to deferred compensation liabilities. Postretirement Benefit Plans In addition to providing pension and 401(k) benefits, we also provide certain health care coverage continuation for qualifying retirees from the date of retirement to age 65 or lifetime, as applicable. The accumulated postretirement benefit obligation was million and million at fiscal year end 2021 and 2020, respectively, and the underfunded status of the postretirement benefit plans was included primarily in long-term pension and postretirement liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

 The income tax expense for fiscal 2021 included a million income tax benefit related to changes in valuation allowances, of which million related to the net reduction in valuation allowances associated primarily with certain tax planning actions, as well as improved current and expected future operating profit and taxable income. In addition, the income tax expense for fiscal 2021 included a million income tax benefit related to an Internal Revenue Service approved change in the tax method of depreciating or amortizing certain assets and million of income tax expense associated with the tax impacts of an intercompany transaction. The income tax expense for fiscal 2020 included million of income tax expense related to the tax impacts of certain measures of the Switzerland Federal Act on Tax Reform and AHV Financing Swiss Tax Reform and an income tax benefit of million related to pre-separation tax matters and the termination of the Tax Sharing Agreement. See Swiss Tax Reform and Tax Sharing Agreement below for additional information. In addition, the income tax expense for fiscal 2020 included million of income tax expense related to increases to the valuation allowance for certain deferred tax assets, related primarily to the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result of the pandemic and its negative impact on our current and expected operating profit and taxable income, we believed it was more likely than not that a portion of our deferred tax assets will not be realized. The pre-tax goodwill impairment charge of million recorded during fiscal 2020 resulted in a tax benefit of million as the associated goodwill was primarily not deductible for income tax purposes. See Note 8 for additional information regarding the impairment of goodwill. The income tax benefit for fiscal 2019 included a million income tax benefit related to the tax impacts of certain measures of Swiss Tax Reform, a million income tax benefit related to the effective settlement of a tax audit in a non-U.S. jurisdiction, and million of income tax expense associated with the tax impacts of certain legal entity

 million (tax effected) recovery of prior years net write-downs of investments in subsidiaries in certain jurisdictions, with a corresponding decrease to tax loss and credit carryforwards. In addition, as discussed above, a million net reduction in valuation allowances was associated primarily with certain tax planning actions, as well as improved current and expected future operating profit and taxable income. We believe that we will generate sufficient future taxable income to realize the income tax benefits related to the remaining net deferred tax assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. We have provided income taxes for earnings that are currently distributed as well as the taxes associated with several subsidiaries earnings that are expected to be distributed in the future. No additional provision has been made for Swiss or non-Swiss income taxes on the undistributed earnings of subsidiaries or for unrecognized deferred tax liabilities for temporary differences related to basis differences in investments in subsidiaries, as such earnings are expected to be permanently reinvested, the investments are essentially permanent in duration, or we have concluded that no additional tax liability will arise as a result of the distribution of such earnings. As of fiscal year end 2021, certain subsidiaries had approximately billion of cumulative undistributed earnings that have been retained indefinitely and reinvested in our global manufacturing operations, including working capital; property, plant, and equipment; intangible assets; and research and development activities. A liability could arise if our intention to permanently reinvest such earnings were to change and amounts are distributed by such subsidiaries or if such subsidiaries are ultimately disposed. It is not practicable to estimate the additional income taxes related to permanently reinvested earnings or the basis differences related to investments in subsidiaries. As of fiscal year end 2021, we had approximately billion of cash, cash equivalents, and intercompany deposits, principally in our subsidiaries, that we have the ability to distribute to TEGSA, our Luxembourg subsidiary, which is the obligor of substantially all of our debt, and to TE Connectivity Ltd., our Swiss parent company, but we consider to be permanently reinvested. We estimate that up to billion of tax expense would be recognized on the Consolidated Financial Statements if our intention to permanently reinvest these amounts were to change. Our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate cash, cash equivalents, and intercompany deposits that are designated as permanently reinvested in order to fund our operations, including investing and financing activities.

We record accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as part of income tax expense (benefit). As of fiscal year end 2021 and 2020, we had million and million, respectively, of accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, recorded primarily in income taxes. During fiscal 2021, 2020, and 2019, we recognized income tax expense of million, benefits of million, and benefits of million, respectively, related to interest and penalties on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. We file income tax returns on a unitary, consolidated, or stand-alone basis in multiple state and local jurisdictions, which generally have statutes of limitations ranging from 3 to . Various state and local income tax returns are currently in the process of examination or administrative appeal.

 . Various non-U.S. subsidiary income tax returns are currently in the process of examination by taxing authorities. As of fiscal year end 2021, under applicable statutes, the following tax years remained subject to examination in the major tax jurisdictions indicated: In most jurisdictions, taxing authorities retain the ability to review prior tax years and to adjust any net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards from these years that are utilized in a subsequent period. Although it is difficult to predict the timing or results of our worldwide examinations, we estimate that approximately million of unrecognized income tax benefits, excluding the impact relating to accrued interest and penalties, could be resolved within the next twelve months. We are not aware of any other matters that would result in significant changes to the amount of unrecognized income tax benefits reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of fiscal year end 2021. Other Income Tax Matters Swiss Tax Reform Swiss Parliament approved the Federal Act on Tax Reform and AHV Financing in September 2018, and it was approved by public vote on May 19, 2019. Swiss Tax Reform eliminated certain preferential tax items and implemented new tax rates at both the federal and cantonal levels. On May 24, 2019, the federal tax authority issued guidance abolishing certain interest deductions effective January 1, 2020. As a result, during fiscal 2019, we recorded a million income tax benefit related primarily to the reduction to the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets. Based on our forecast of taxable income and the abolishment of certain interest deductions, we believed it was more likely than not that additional deferred tax assets for tax loss carryforwards in Switzerland would be realized in the future.

 million of income tax expense related primarily to cantonal implementation and the resulting write-down of certain deferred tax assets to the lower tax rates. Tax Sharing Agreement Upon our separation from Tyco International plc in fiscal 2007, we entered into a Tax Sharing Agreement with Tyco International plc (now part of Johnson Controls International plc) and Covidien plc (now part of Medtronic plc) under which we shared certain income tax liabilities for periods prior to and including June 29, 2007. Pursuant to the Tax Sharing Agreement, we entered into certain guarantee commitments and indemnifications. In fiscal 2020, we, Johnson Controls International plc, and Medtronic plc entered into an agreement to terminate the Tax Sharing Agreement. We believe that substantially all income tax matters that may be subject to the Tax Sharing Agreement have been settled with tax authorities and we do not expect any remaining tax matters to have a material effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. Accordingly, during fiscal 2020, we recognized an income tax benefit of million and net other income of million representing settlement of the remaining shared pre-separation income tax matters and indemnification balances. Dilutive impact of share-based compensation arrangements Diluted For fiscal 2020, there were million nonvested share awards and options outstanding with underlying exercise prices less than the average market prices of our common shares; however, these were excluded from the calculation of diluted loss per share as inclusion would be antidilutive as a result of our loss during the period. The following share options were not included in the computation of diluted earnings (loss) per share because the instruments underlying exercise prices were greater than the average market prices of our common shares and inclusion would be antidilutive:

Contributed Surplus As a result of cumulative equity transactions, including dividend activity and treasury share cancellations, our contributed surplus balance was reduced to zero with residual activity recorded against accumulated earnings as reflected on the Consolidated Statement of Shareholders Equity. To the extent that the contributed surplus balance continues to be zero, the impact of future transactions that normally would have been recorded as a reduction of contributed surplus will be recorded in accumulated earnings. Contributed surplus established for Swiss tax and statutory purposes Swiss Contributed Surplus is not impacted by our GAAP treatment. Swiss Contributed Surplus, subject to certain conditions, is a freely distributable reserve. As of fiscal year end 2021 and 2020, Swiss Contributed Surplus was CHF million and CHF million, respectively (equivalent to million and million, respectively). Dividends We paid cash dividends to shareholders of , , and per share in fiscal 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively.

Exhibit 4.1 Description of Securities Registered Pursuant to Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 As of November 8, 2021, TE Connectivity Ltd., a Swiss corporation, had one class of securities registered under Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ): Common Shares, par value CHF 0.57 per share (the Common Shares ). The following summary includes a brief description of the Common Shares, as well as certain related additional information. Unless the context requires otherwise, references to we, us, our and the Company refer to TE Connectivity Ltd. Share Capital Our share capital is CHF 191,576,932.17, which is divided into 336,099,881 registered shares with a par value of CHF 0.57 each. Authorized Share Capital Our Articles of Association (the Articles authorize our board of directors to increase share capital at any time until March 11, 2022 by an amount not exceeding CHF 95,788,465.80 through the issuance of up to 168,049,940 fully paid up registered shares with a par value of CHF 0.57 each. In an authorized capital increase, our shareholders would have preemptive rights to obtain newly issued registered shares in an amount proportional to the par value of the registered shares they already hold. Our board of directors, however, may withdraw or limit these preemptive rights in certain circumstances as set forth in our Articles and as described under Preemptive Rights and Advance Subscription Rights Withdrawal or Limitation of Preemptive Rights with Respect to Authorized Share Capital. Conditional Share Capital Our Articles provide that the share capital of the Company shall be increased by an amount not exceeding CHF 95,788,465.80 through the issuance of a maximum of 168,049,940 registered shares, payable in full, with a par value of CHF 0.57 each: through the exercise of conversion, option, exchange, warrant or similar rights for the subscription of shares granted to third parties or shareholders in connection with bonds (including convertible bonds and bonds with options), options, warrants or other securities issued or to be issued in national or international capital markets or new or already existing contractual obligations by or of the Company, one of its group companies or any of their respective predecessors (hereinafter the Rights-Bearing Obligations and/or the exercise of rights attached to Rights-Bearing Obligations granted to members of the board of directors, members of the executive management, employees, contractors, consultants or other persons providing services to the Company, group companies or a person that directly, or indirectly, through one or more intermediaries, controls or is controlled by, or is under common control with another person. 
 Preemptive Rights and Advance Subscription Rights Under the Swiss Code of Obligations (the Swiss Code ), the prior approval of a general meeting of shareholders generally is required to authorize the issuance of registered shares or rights to subscribe for, or convert into, registered shares. In addition, shareholders have preemptive rights or advance subscription rights (which are essentially the same as preemptive rights) in relation to such registered shares or rights in proportion to the respective par values of their holdings. With the affirmative vote of shareholders holding two-thirds of the voting rights and a majority of the par value of the registered shares represented at the general meeting, shareholders may withdraw or limit the preemptive rights or advance subscription rights. 
 1 

Withdrawal or Limitation of Preemptive Rights with Respect to Authorized Share Capital Our board of directors is authorized pursuant to our Articles to withdraw or limit the preemptive rights with respect to the issuance of registered shares from authorized capital: if the issue price of the new registered shares is determined by reference to the market price; if the registered shares are issued in connection with the acquisition of an enterprise or business or any part of an enterprise, business or investment, the financing or refinancing of any such transactions; if the registered shares are issued in connection with the financing of new investment plans; if the registered shares are issued in connection with the intended broadening of the shareholder constituency in certain financial or investor markets, for the purposes of the investment of strategic partners or in connection with the listing of the registered shares on domestic or foreign stock exchanges; in connection with a placement or sale of registered shares, the grant of an over-allotment option of up to 20 of the total number of registered shares in a placement or sale of registered shares to the initial purchasers or underwriters; or for the participation of directors, executive officers, employees, contractors, consultants and other persons performing services for our benefit or that of our subsidiaries and affiliates. 
 Withdrawal or Limitation of Advance Subscription Rights with Respect to Conditional Share Capital In connection with the issuance of Rights-Bearing Obligations convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for our registered shares, our board of directors is authorized pursuant to our Articles to withdraw or limit the advance subscription rights of shareholders with respect to registered shares issued from our conditional share capital: if the issuance is for purposes of financing or refinancing the acquisition of an enterprise, part(s) of an enterprise, investments in equity or other investments; if the issuance occurs in national or international capital markets or through a private placement; or for purposes of the defense of an actual, threatened or potential unsolicited takeover bid, in relation to which our board of directors, upon consultation with an independent financial adviser, has not recommended acceptance to the shareholders. 
 If the advance subscription rights are withdrawn or limited: the Rights-Bearing Obligations shall be issued or entered into at market conditions; the Rights-Bearing Obligations may be converted, exchanged or exercised during a maximum period of 30 years from the date on which the Rights-Bearing Obligations are issued; and the conversion, exchange or exercise price of the Rights-Bearing Obligations is to be set at least in line with the market conditions prevailing at the date on which the Rights-Bearing Obligations are issued. 
 Preemptive and advance subscription rights are excluded with respect to issuances from our conditional share capital to directors, officers, employees and other persons providing services to any of our subsidiaries or affiliates. 
 2 

Dividends and Distributions Rights Under Swiss law, dividends may be paid only if the Company has sufficient distributable profits from the previous fiscal year, or if the corporation has freely distributable reserves, each as presented on the audited annual unconsolidated Swiss statutory balance sheet of the Company. Reserves from capital contributions (as determined for Swiss tax purposes) qualify as freely distributable reserves and may be paid out as dividends to shareholders subject to certain conditions and to the extent permissible under the Swiss Code. Payments out of the registered share capital the aggregate par value of a company s registered share capital must be made by way of a capital reduction. The affirmative vote of shareholders holding a majority of the registered shares represented at a general meeting must approve reserve reclassifications and distributions of dividends. Distributions also may take the form of a distribution of cash or property that results in a reduction of our share capital recorded in the commercial register. Such a capital reduction requires the affirmative vote of shareholders holding a majority of the registered shares represented at the general meeting. A special audit report must confirm that creditors claims remain fully covered by assets despite the reduction in the share capital recorded in the commercial register. Upon approval by the general meeting of shareholders of the capital reduction, the board of directors must give public notice of the capital reduction resolution in the Swiss Official Gazette of Commerce three times and notify creditors that they may request, within two months of the third publication, satisfaction of or security for their claims. Under the Swiss Code, if our general reserves amount to less than 20 of the share capital recorded in the commercial register, then at least 5 of our annual profit must be retained as general reserves. The Swiss Code permits us to accrue additional general reserves. In addition, we are required to create a special reserve on our stand-alone annual statutory balance sheet in the amount of the purchase price of registered shares that any of our subsidiaries own and this amount may not be used for dividends or subsequent repurchases. Swiss corporations generally must maintain a separate company, unconsolidated statutory balance sheet for the purpose of determining the amounts available for the return of capital to shareholders, including by way of a distribution of dividends. Our auditor must confirm that a dividend proposal made to shareholders conforms with the requirements of the Swiss Code and our Articles. Dividends are due and payable in accordance with the terms of the shareholders resolution approving the payment. We make dividend payments to shareholders in US dollars. The reduction to our reserves in our Swiss statutory balance sheet, which is required to be made in Swiss francs, is determined based on the aggregate amount of the dividend and converted from US dollars to Swiss francs at the exchange rate in effect on the date of the relevant shareholder resolution. We are required under Swiss law to make any distributions which are in the form of a capital reduction out of registered share capital as denominated in Swiss francs. Voting Rights Each registered share carries one vote at a general meeting of shareholders. Pursuant to our Articles, shareholders generally pass resolutions and elect directors and auditors by the affirmative vote of an absolute majority of the registered shares represented at the general meeting of shareholders unless otherwise provided by law or our articles of association. An absolute majority means at least half plus one additional vote represented at the meeting. With respect to the election of directors, each holder of registered shares entitled to vote at the election has the right to vote, in person or by proxy, the number of registered shares held by him or her and entitled to vote for as many persons as there are directors to be elected. 
 3 

Supermajority Voting The Swiss Code and our Articles require the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of the share votes and a majority of the par value of the registered shares, each as represented at a general meeting, to approve the following matters: change of the Company s purpose; the creation of shares with preferred voting rights; the restriction on the registration of shares; an authorized or conditional increase in the nominal share capital; an increase in the nominal share capital through the conversion of capital surplus, through a contribution in kind, or in exchange for an acquisition of assets, or a grant of special privileges; the restriction or withdrawal of preemptive or advance subscription rights; a change in our place of incorporation; our dissolution; and a merger, demerger, conversion or other transaction as enumerated in Switzerland s Federal Act on Mergers, Demergers, Transformations and the Transfer of Assets (the Merger Act to the extent required by the Merger Act. 
 In addition, the amendment of certain provisions of our Articles requires the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of the share votes represented and a majority of the par value of the registered shares represented, and in certain instances, the affirmative vote of 80 of the total votes of shares entitled to vote. Rights upon Liquidation; Restrictions on Transfer Under Swiss law, any surplus arising out of liquidation, after the settlement of all claims of all creditors, will be distributed to shareholders in proportion to the paid-up par value of registered shares held, subject to Swiss withholding tax requirements. We have not imposed any restrictions applicable to the transfer of our registered shares. No Redemption or Conversion The registered shares are not convertible into shares of any other class or series or subject to redemption either by us or by the holder of the shares. Mergers and Other Business Combinations Our Articles require a special supermajority for any resolution of the general meeting of shareholders to engage in a business combination with an interested shareholder (one who acquired 15 or more of the share capital recorded in the commercial register without prior approval of the board of directors) for a period of three years following the time that such person became a 15 shareholder, subject to certain exceptions discussed below. 
 4 

The supermajority required is the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of all the shares entitled to vote which are not owned by the interested shareholder. Such a vote will not be required if: the board of directors approved the business combination prior to the time the shareholder became an interested shareholder; or upon consummation of the transaction which resulted in the shareholder becoming an interested shareholder, the interested shareholder owned at least 85 of the voting shares outstanding at the time the transaction commenced, excluding for purposes of determining the voting shares outstanding (but not the outstanding voting shares owned by the interested shareholders) those shares owned (i) by persons who are directors and also officers and (ii) employee share plans in which employee participants do not have the right to determine confidentially whether shares held subject to the plan will be tendered in a tender or exchange offer. 
 Certain Other Provisions of Our Articles of Association Our Articles include the following provisions, not previously discussed above, that may have an effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change of control of the Company: (i) an advance notice procedure for shareholders to nominate directors or present other proposals at general meetings; and (ii) shareholders may act only at shareholder meetings and not by written consent. The foregoing summary does not purport to be complete and is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by, the full text of the Articles and Organizational Regulations of the Company, each of which are exhibits to our Annual Report on Form 10-K. We encourage you to read both as well as the applicable provisions of the Swiss Code.

ARTICLE IV AWARDS 4.1 Eligibility. All Employees and Directors are eligible to be designated to receive Awards granted under the Plan, except as otherwise provided in this Article IV. 4.2 Form of Awards. Awards will be in the form determined by the Committee, in its discretion, and will be evidenced by an Award Certificate. Awards may be granted singly or in combination or in tandem with other Awards. 4.3 Stock Options and Stock Appreciation Rights. The Committee may grant Stock Options and Stock Appreciation Rights under the Plan to those Employees whom the Committee may from time to time select, in the amounts and pursuant to the other terms and conditions that the Committee, in its discretion, may determine and set forth in the Award Certificate, subject to the provisions below: (a) Form. Stock Options granted under the Plan will, at the discretion of the Committee and as set forth in the Award Certificate, be in the form of Incentive Stock Options, Nonqualified Stock Options or a combination of the two. If an Incentive Stock Option and a Nonqualified Stock Option are granted to the same Participant under the Plan at the same time, the form of each will be clearly identified, and they will be deemed to have been granted in separate grants. In no event will the exercise of one Award affect the right to exercise the other Award. Stock Appreciation Rights may be granted either alone or in connection with concurrently or previously granted Nonqualified Stock Options. (b) Exercise Price. The Committee will set the Exercise Price of Fair Market Value Stock Options or Stock Appreciation Rights granted under the Plan at a price that is not less than the Fair Market Value of a Share on the date of grant, subject to adjustment as provided in Section 5.3. The Committee will set the Exercise Price of Premium-Priced Stock Options at a price that is higher than the Fair Market Value of a Share as of the date of grant, provided that such price is no higher than 150 percent of such Fair Market Value. The Exercise Price of Incentive Stock Options will be equal to or greater than 110 percent of the Fair Market Value of a Share as of the date of grant if the Participant receiving the Stock Options owns stock possessing more than 10 percent of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock of the Company or any subsidiary or parent corporation of the Company, as defined in Section 424 of the Code. The Exercise Price of a Stock Appreciation Right granted in tandem with a Stock Option will equal the Exercise Price of the related Stock Option. The Committee will set forth the Exercise Price of a Stock Option or Stock Appreciation Right in the Award Certificate. Stock Options granted under the Plan will, at the discretion of the Committee and as set forth in the Award Certificate, be Fair Market Value Stock Options, Premium-Priced Stock Options or a combination of Fair Market Value Stock Options and Premium- Priced Stock Options. (c) Term and Timing of Exercise. Each Stock Option or Stock Appreciation Right granted under the Plan will be exercisable in whole or in part, subject to the following conditions, unless determined otherwise by the Committee: (i) The Committee will determine and set forth in the Award Certificate the date on which any Award of Stock Options or Stock Appreciation Rights to a Participant may first be exercised. Unless the applicable Award Certificate provides otherwise, a Stock Option or Stock Appreciation Right will become vested and exercisable in equal annual installments over a period of four years beginning immediately after the date on which the Stock Option or Stock Appreciation Right was granted. The right to exercise a Stock Option or Stock Appreciation Right will lapse no later than 10 years after the date of grant (or five years in the case of an Incentive Stock Option granted to an Employee who owns stock possessing more than 10 percent of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock of the Company or any subsidiary or parent corporation of the Company, as defined in Section 424 of the Code), except to the extent necessary to comply with applicable laws outside of the United States or to preserve the tax advantages of the Award outside the United States. (ii) Unless the applicable Award Certificate provides otherwise, upon the death or Disability of a Participant who has outstanding Stock Options or Stock Appreciation Rights, the unvested Stock Options or Stock Appreciation Rights will become fully vested and will lapse, and will not thereafter be exercisable, upon the earlier of (A) their original expiration date or (B) the date that is three years after the date on which the Participant dies or incurs a Disability. 
 9 

(iii) With respect to Awards granted prior to the Effective Date, unless the applicable Award Certificate provides otherwise, upon the Retirement of a Participant, a pro rata portion of the Participant s Stock Options and Stock Appreciation Rights will vest so that the total number of vested Stock Options or Stock Appreciation Rights held by the Participant at Termination of Employment (including those that have already vested as of such date) will be equal to (A) the total number of Stock Options or Stock Appreciation Rights originally granted to the Participant under each Award multiplied by (ii) a fraction, the numerator of which is the period of time (in whole months) that have elapsed since the date of grant, and the denominator of which is four years (or such other applicable vesting term as is set forth in the Award Certificate). With respect to Awards granted on or after the Effective Date, unless the applicable Award Certificate provides otherwise, upon the Retirement of a Participant, provided that the Participant has provided Retirement Notice in the case of a voluntary Termination of Employment relating to Retirement, the Participant s Stock Options and Stock Appreciation Rights will continue to vest under the terms and conditions of the Stock Option and Stock Appreciation Right following the Termination of Employment to the same extent the Participant would have vested had the Participant not had a Termination of Employment, provided that the Participant continues to satisfy all other applicable conditions as may be established by the Committee on or prior to the date of the Termination of Employment with respect to such continued vesting. Unless the Award Certificate provides otherwise, such Participant s Stock Options and Stock Appreciation Rights will lapse, and will not thereafter be exercisable, upon the earlier of (A) their original expiration date or (B) the date that is three years after the date of Termination of Employment (or, for Awards granted on or after the Effective Date in the case of Retirement, five years after Termination of Employment). (iv) Upon the Termination of Employment of a Participant that does not meet the requirements of paragraphs (ii) or (iii) above, or as otherwise provided in Section 5.4 (Change in Control), any unvested Stock Options or Stock Appreciation Rights will be forfeited unless the Award Certificate provides otherwise. Any Stock Options or Stock Appreciation Rights that are vested as of such Termination of Employment will lapse, and will not thereafter be exercisable, upon the earlier of (A) their original expiration date or (B) the date that is ninety (90) days after the date of such Termination of Employment unless the Award Certificate provides otherwise. (v) Stock Options and Stock Appreciation Rights of a deceased Participant may be exercised only by the estate of the Participant or by the person given authority to exercise the Stock Options or Stock Appreciation Rights by the Participant s will or by operation of law. If a Stock Option or Stock Appreciation Right is exercised by the executor or administrator of a deceased Participant, or by the person or persons to whom the Stock Option or Stock Appreciation Right has been transferred by the Participant s will or the applicable laws of descent and distribution, the Company will be under no obligation to deliver Shares or cash until the Company is satisfied that the person exercising the Stock Option or Stock Appreciation Right is the duly appointed executor or administrator of the deceased Participant or the person to whom the Stock Option or Stock Appreciation Right has been transferred by the Participant s will or by applicable laws of descent and distribution. (vi) A Stock Appreciation Right granted in tandem with a Stock Option is subject to the same terms and conditions as the related Stock Option and will be exercisable only to the extent that the related Stock Option is exercisable. (d) Payment of Exercise Price. The Exercise Price of a Stock Option must be paid in full when the Stock Option is exercised. Stock certificates will be registered and delivered only upon receipt of payment. Payment of the Exercise Price may be made in cash or by certified check, bank draft, wire transfer, or postal or express money order, provided that the format is approved by the Company or a designated third-party administrator. The Committee, in its discretion may also allow payment to be made by any of the following methods, as set forth in the Award Certificate: (i) Delivering a properly executed exercise notice to the Company or its agent, together with irrevocable instructions to a broker to deliver to the Company, within the typical settlement cycle for the sale of equity securities on the relevant trading market (or otherwise in accordance with the provisions of Regulation T issued by the Federal Reserve Board), the amount of sale proceeds with respect to the portion of the Shares to be acquired having a Fair Market Value on the date of exercise equal to the sum of the applicable portion of the Exercise Price being so paid; 
 10 

(ii) Tendering (actually or by attestation) to the Company previously acquired, and that have a Fair Market Value on the day prior to the date of exercise equal to the applicable portion of the Exercise Price being so paid, provided that the Board has specifically approved the repurchase of such Shares (unless such approval is not required by the terms of the bye-laws of the Company) and the Committee has determined that, as of the date of repurchase, the Company is, and after the repurchase will continue to be, able to pay its liabilities as they become due; or (iii) Provided such payment method has been expressly authorized by the Board or the Committee in advance and subject to any requirements of applicable law and regulations, instructing the Company to reduce the number of Shares that would otherwise be issued by such number of Shares as have in the aggregate a Fair Market Value on the date of exercise equal to the applicable portion of the Exercise Price being so paid. (e) Incentive Stock Options. Incentive Stock Options granted under the Plan will be subject to the following additional conditions, limitations and restrictions: (i) Eligibility. Incentive Stock Options may be granted only to Employees of the Company or a Subsidiary that is a subsidiary or parent corporation of the Company, within the meaning of Section 424 of the Code. (ii) Timing of Grant. No Incentive Stock Option will be granted under the Plan after March 7, 2027. (iii) Amount of Award. Subject to Section 5.3, no more than 10 million Shares may be available for grant in the form of Incentive Stock Options. The aggregate Fair Market Value (as of the date of grant) of the Shares with respect to which the Incentive Stock Options awarded to any Employee first become exercisable during any calendar year may not exceed 100,000 (U.S.). For purposes of this 100,000 (U.S.) limit, the Employee s Incentive Stock Options under this Plan and all other plans maintained by the Company and its Subsidiaries will be aggregated. To the extent any Incentive Stock Option would exceed the 100,000 (U.S.) limit, the Incentive Stock Option will afterwards be treated as a Nonqualified Stock Option for all purposes to the extent required by the Code and underlying regulations and rulings. (iv) Timing of Exercise. If the Committee exercises its discretion in the Award Certificate to permit an Incentive Stock Option to be exercised by a Participant more than three months after the Participant has ceased being an Employee (or more than 12 months if the Participant is permanently and totally disabled, within the meaning of Section 22(e) of the Code), the Incentive Stock Option will afterwards be treated as a Nonqualified Stock Option to the extent required by the Code and underlying regulations and rulings. For purposes of this paragraph (iv), an Employee s employment relationship will be treated as continuing intact while the Employee is on military leave, sick leave or another approved leave of absence if the period of leave does not exceed 90 days, or a longer period to the extent that the Employee s right to reemployment with the Company or a Subsidiary is guaranteed by statute or by contract. If the period of leave exceeds 90 days and the Employee s right to reemployment is not guaranteed by statute or contract, the employment relationship will be deemed to have ceased on the 91st day of the leave. (v) Transfer Restrictions. In no event will the Committee permit an Incentive Stock Option to be transferred by an Employee other than by will or the laws of descent and distribution, and any Incentive Stock Option awarded under this Plan will be exercisable only by the Employee during the Employee s lifetime. (f) Exercise of Stock Appreciation Rights. Upon exercise of a Participant s Stock Appreciation Rights, the Company will pay cash or Shares or a combination of cash and Shares, in the discretion of the Committee and as described in the Award Certificate. Cash payments will be equal to the excess of the Fair Market Value of a Share on the date of exercise over the Exercise Price, for each Share for which a Stock Appreciation Right was exercised. If Shares are paid for the Stock Appreciation Right, the Participant will receive a number of whole Shares equal to the quotient of the cash payment amount divided by the Fair Market Value of a Share on the date of exercise. 
 11 

(g) No Repricing. Except as otherwise provided in Section 5.3, in no event will the Committee (i) decrease the Exercise Price of a Stock Option or Stock Appreciation Right after the date of grant or (ii) cancel outstanding Stock Options or Stock Appreciation Rights in exchange for a cash payment or for a grant of replacement Stock Options or Stock Appreciation Rights with a lower Exercise Price than that of the replaced Stock Options or Stock Appreciation Rights or other Awards, without first obtaining the approval of the holders of a majority of the Shares who are present in person or by proxy at a meeting of the Company s stockholders and entitled to vote. 4.4 Annual Performance Bonuses. The Committee may grant Annual Performance Bonuses under the Plan in the form of cash or Shares to the Reporting Persons and Key Employees that the Committee may from time to time select, in the amounts and pursuant to the terms and conditions that the Committee may determine and set forth in the Award Certificate, subject to the provisions below: (a) Performance Cycles. Annual Performance Bonuses will be awarded in connection with a 12-month (or longer) Performance Cycle, which will be the fiscal year of the Company. (b) Eligible Participants. The Committee will determine the Reporting Persons and Key Employees who will be eligible to receive an Annual Performance Bonus that are Qualified Performance-Based Awards under the Plan within 90 days after the commencement of the relevant Performance Cycle (or such other date as may be required or permitted under applicable regulations under Section 162(m) of the Code). (c) Performance Measures; Targets; Award Criteria. (i) For Annual Performance Bonuses that are Qualified Performance-Based Awards, within 90 days after the commencement of a Performance Cycle (or such other date as may be required or permitted under applicable regulations under Section 162(m) of the Code), and while the attainment of the Performance Measures remains substantially uncertain, the Committee will fix and establish in writing (A) the Performance Measures that will apply to that Performance Cycle; (B) the Target Amount payable to each Participant; and (C) subject to subsection (d) below, the criteria for computing the amount that will be paid with respect to each level of attained performance. The Committee will also set forth the minimum level of performance, based on objective factors, that must be attained during the Performance Cycle before any Annual Performance Bonus will be paid and the percentage of the Target Amount that will become payable upon attainment of various levels of performance that equal or exceed the minimum required level. (ii) The Committee may, in its discretion, select Performance Measures that measure the performance of the Company or one or more business units, divisions or Subsidiaries of the Company. The Committee may select Performance Measures that are absolute or relative to the performance of one or more comparable companies or an index of comparable companies. (iii) The Committee, in its discretion, may, on a case-by-case basis, modify the amount payable to any Reporting Person or Key Employee with respect to any given Performance Cycle, provided, however, that with respect to Qualified Performance-Based Awards, the amount payable under any such Award may not be increased and no reduction will result in an increase in the amount payable under any Annual Performance Bonus of another Key Employee. (d) Payment, Certification. No Annual Performance Bonus pursuant to a Qualified Performance-Based Award will vest until the Committee certifies in writing the level of performance attained for the Performance Cycle in relation to the applicable Performance Measures. (e) Form of Payment. Annual Performance Bonuses will be paid in cash or Shares. All such Performance Bonuses shall be paid no later than the 15th day of the third month following the end of the calendar year (or, if later, following the end of the Company s fiscal year) in which such Performance Bonuses are no longer subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture (as determined for purposes of Section 409A of the Code), except to the extent that a Participant has elected to defer payment under the terms of a duly authorized deferred compensation arrangement in which case the terms of such arrangement shall govern. (f) Section 162(m) of the Code. It is the intent of the Company that Annual Performance Bonuses that are Qualified Performance-Based Awards satisfy the requirements for performance-based compensation for purposes of Section 162(m) of the Code, that this Section 4.4 be interpreted in a manner that permits such Awards to satisfy the applicable requirements of Section 162(m)(C) of the Code and related regulations, and that the Plan be operated so that the Company may take a full tax deduction for Annual Performance Bonuses that are Qualified Performance- 
 12 

Based Awards. If any provision of this Plan or any Annual Performance Bonus would otherwise frustrate or conflict with this intent, the provision will be interpreted and deemed amended so as to avoid this conflict. (g) Retirement, Death, Disability and Other Events. Unless otherwise determined by the Committee, if a Participant would be entitled to an Annual Performance Bonus but for the fact that the Participant s employment with the Company terminated prior to the end of the Performance Cycle as a result of the Participant s Retirement, death or Disability, or such other event as designated by the Committee, the Participant may, in the Committee s discretion, receive an Annual Performance Bonus Award, pro rated for the portion of the Performance Cycle that the Participant completed and which is payable at the same time after the end of the Performance Cycle that payments to other Annual Performance Bonus Award recipients are made. 4.5 Long Term Performance Awards.

(b) Eligible Participants. The Committee will determine the Employees who will be eligible to receive a Long Term Performance Award for the Performance Cycle that are Qualified Performance-Based Awards within 90 days after the commencement of the relevant Performance Cycle (or such other date as may be required or permitted under applicable regulations under Section 162(m) of the Code), provided that the Committee may determine the eligibility of a Participant who receives a Long Term Performance Award for the Performance Cycle that is not a Qualified Performance-Based Award after the expiration of the 90-day period. (c) Performance Measures; Targets; Award Criteria. (i) For Long Term Performance Awards that are Qualified Performance-Based Awards, within 90 days after the commencement of a Performance Cycle (or such other date as may be required or permitted under applicable regulations under Section 162(m) of the Code), and while the attainment of the Performance Measures remains substantially uncertain, the Committee will fix and establish in writing (A) the Performance Measures that will apply to that Performance Cycle; (B) with respect to Performance Units, the Target Amount payable to each Participant; (C) with respect to Restricted Units and Restricted Stock, the Target Vesting Percentage for each Participant; and (D) subject to subsection (d) below, the criteria for computing the amount that will be paid or will vest with respect to each level of attained performance. The Committee will also set forth the minimum level of performance, based on objective factors, that must be attained during the Performance Cycle before any Long Term Performance Award will be paid or vest, and the percentage of Performance Units that will become payable and the percentage of performance- based Restricted Units or Shares of Restricted Stock that will vest upon attainment of various levels of performance that equal or exceed the minimum required level. (ii) The Committee may, in its discretion, select Performance Measures that measure the performance of the Company or one or more business units, divisions or Subsidiaries of the Company. The Committee may select Performance Measures that are absolute or relative to the performance of one or more comparable companies or an index of comparable companies. (iii) The Committee, in its discretion, may, on a case-by-case basis, modify the amount of Long Term Performance Awards payable to any Key Employee with respect to any given Performance Cycle, provided, however, that with respect to Qualified Performance-Based Awards, the amount payable under any such Award may not be increased and no reduction will result in an increase in the dollar amount or number of Shares payable under any Long Term Performance Award of another Key Employee. (iv) With respect to a Long Term Performance Award (or any portion thereof) that is not a Qualified Performance-Based Award, the Committee may establish, in its discretion, performance criteria other than the Performance Measures that will be applicable for the Performance Cycle. 
 13 

(d) Payment, Certification. No Long Term Performance Award granted pursuant to a Qualified Performance-Based Award will vest with respect to any Employee until the Committee certifies in writing the level of performance attained for the Performance Cycle in relation to the applicable Performance Measures. Long Term Performance Awards that are not Qualified Performance-Based will be based on the Performance Measures, or other applicable performance criteria, and payment formulas that the Committee, in its discretion, may establish for these purposes. These Performance Measures, or other performance criteria, and formulas may be the same as or different than the Performance Measures and formulas that apply to Qualified Performance-Based Awards. (e) Form of Payment. Long Term Performance Awards in the form of Performance Units may be paid in cash or full Shares, in the discretion of the Committee, and as set forth in the Award Certificate. Performance-based Restricted Units and Restricted Stock will be paid in full Shares. Payment with respect to any fractional Share will be in cash in an amount based on the Fair Market Value of the Share as of the date the Performance Unit becomes payable. All such Long Term Performance Awards shall be paid no later than the 15th day of the third month following the end of the calendar year (or, if later, following the end of the Company s fiscal year) in which such Long Term Performance Awards are no longer subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture (as determined for purposes of Code Section 409A), except to the extent that a Participant has elected to defer payment under the terms of a duly authorized deferred compensation arrangement, in which case the terms of such arrangement shall govern. (f) Section 162(m) of the Code. It is the intent of the Company that Long Term Performance Awards that are Qualified Performance-Based Awards satisfy the requirements for performance-based compensation for purposes of Section 162(m) of the Code, that this Section 4.5 be interpreted in a manner that permits such Awards to satisfy the applicable requirements of Section 162(m)(C) of the Code and related regulations with respect to Long Term Performance awards made to Key Employees, and that the Plan be operated so that the Company may take a full tax deduction for Long Term Performance Awards that are Qualified Performance-Based Awards. If any provision of this Plan or any Long Term Performance Award would otherwise frustrate or conflict with this intent, the provision will be interpreted and deemed amended so as to avoid this conflict. (g) Retirement, Death, Disability and Other Events. Unless the Award Certificate provides otherwise, if a Participant would be entitled to a Long Term Performance Award but for the fact that the Participant s employment with the Company terminated prior to the end of the Performance Cycle as a result of the Participant s Retirement (for any Award granted prior to the Effective Date), death or Disability, or such other event as designated by the Committee, the Participant may, in the Committee s discretion, receive a Long Term Performance Award, prorated for the portion of the Performance Cycle that the Participant completed and payable at the same time after the end of the Performance Cycle that payments to other Long Term Performance Award recipients are made. Unless the Award Certificate provides otherwise, for any Award granted on or after the Effective Date, if a Participant would be entitled to a Long Term Performance Award but for the fact that the Participant s employment with the Company terminated prior to the end of the Performance Cycle as a result of the Participant s Retirement, provided that the Participant has provided Retirement Notice in the case of a voluntary Termination of Employment relating to Retirement, the Long Term Performance Award will continue to vest under the terms and conditions of the Award Certificate following the Termination of Employment to the same extent the Participant would have vested had the Participant not had a Termination of Employment, and such Long Term Performance Award will be payable at the same time after the end of the Performance Cycle that payments to other Long Term Performance Award recipients are made, provided that the Participant continues to satisfy all other applicable conditions as may be established by the Committee on or prior to the date of the Retirement with respect to such continued vesting. (h) Dividends and Dividend Equivalents. In the event of a payment of dividends on Common Stock, the Committee may credit Long Term Performance Awards made under this Section 4.5 with Dividend Equivalents in accordance with terms and conditions established in the discretion of the Committee. Unless otherwise provided in the applicable Award Certificate, Dividend Equivalents will be subject to the same vesting requirements as the underlying Long-Term Performance Award and will become payable or deliverable only to the extent that the underlying Long-Term Performance Award vests and becomes payable or deliverable. In no event will Dividend Equivalents be payable or deliverable prior to the vesting date of the underlying Long-Term Performance Award. The number of any Dividend Equivalents credited to a Participant s Award upon the payment of a dividend on Common Shares will be equal to the quotient produced by dividing the cash value of the dividend by the Fair Market Value of one Share as of the date the dividend is paid. 4.6 Other Stock-Based Awards. The Committee may, from time to time, grant Awards (other than Stock Options, Stock Appreciation Rights, Annual Performance Bonuses or Long Term Performance Awards) to any Employee who the Committee may from time to time select, which Awards consist of, or are denominated in, payable in, valued in whole or in part by reference to, or otherwise related to, Shares. These Awards may include, among other forms, Restricted Stock, 
 14 

Restricted Units, or Deferred Stock Units. The Committee will determine, in its discretion, the terms and conditions that will apply to Awards granted pursuant to this Section 4.6, which terms and conditions will be set forth in the applicable Award Certificate. (a) Vesting. Unless the Award Certificate provides otherwise, restrictions on Stock-Based Awards granted under this Section 4.6 will lapse in equal annual installments over a period of four years beginning immediately after the date of grant. If the restrictions on Stock-Based Awards have not lapsed or been satisfied as of the Participant s Termination of Employment, the Shares will be forfeited by the Participant if the termination is for any reason other than the Retirement, death or Disability of the Participant or a Change in Control, unless as otherwise provided in the Award Certificate. Unless the Award Certificate provides otherwise, (i) all restrictions on Stock-Based Awards granted pursuant to this Section 4.6 will lapse upon the death or Disability of the Participant, (ii) in the event of Retirement for any Award granted prior to the Effective Date, the Award will vest pro rata with respect to the portion of the four-year vesting term (or such other vesting term as is set forth in the Award Certificate) that the Participant has completed as of the Participant s Termination of Employment and provided that the Participant has satisfied all other applicable conditions established by the Committee with respect to such pro rata vesting, (iii) in the event of Retirement for any Award granted on or after the Effective Date, provided that the Participant has provided Retirement Notice in the case of a voluntary Termination of Employment relating to Retirement, the Award will continue to vest under the terms and conditions of the Award Certificate following the Termination of Employment to the same extent the Participant would have vested had the Participant not had a Termination of Employment, provided that the Participant continues to satisfy all other applicable conditions as may be established by the Committee on or prior to the date of Retirement with respect to such continued vesting, and (iv) in the event of a Change in Control, Stock-Based Awards will be treated in accordance with Section 5.4. In no event may the vesting period of a time-based full-value share award be less than three years (on either a cliff or graded vesting basis), except that the Committee may award up to 10 percent of the shares authorized for issuance under Section 5.1 with a vesting period of less than three years under such circumstances as it deems appropriate. (b) Grant of Restricted Stock. The Committee may grant Restricted Stock to any Employee, which Shares will be registered in the name of the Participant and held for the Participant by the Company. The Participant will have all rights of a stockholder with respect to the Shares, including the right to vote and to receive dividends or other distributions, except that the Shares may be subject to a vesting schedule and will be forfeited if the Participant attempts to sell, transfer, assign, pledge or otherwise encumber or dispose of the Shares before the restrictions are satisfied or lapse. (c) Grant of Restricted Units. The Committee may grant Restricted Units to any Employee, which Units will be paid in cash or whole Shares or a combination of cash and Shares, as determined in the discretion of the Committee. The Committee will determine the terms and conditions applicable to the grant of Restricted Units, which terms and conditions will be set forth in the Award Certificate. For each Restricted Unit that vests, one Share will be paid or an amount in cash equal to the Fair Market Value of a Share, as set forth in the Award Certificate, will be delivered to the Participant on the applicable delivery date. (d) Grant of Deferred Stock Units. The Committee may grant Deferred Stock Units to any Employee, which Units will be paid in whole Shares upon the Employee s Termination of Employment if the restrictions on the Units have lapsed. One Share will be paid for each Deferred Stock Unit that becomes payable. (e) Dividends and Dividend Equivalents. In the event of a payment of dividends on Common Stock, the Committee may credit Other Stock-Based Awards made under this Section 4.6 with Dividend Equivalents in accordance with terms and conditions established in the discretion of the Committee. Unless otherwise provided in the applicable Award Certificate, Dividend Equivalents will be subject to the same vesting requirements as the underlying Other Stock-Based Award and will become payable or deliverable only to the extent that the underlying Other Stock-Based Award vests and becomes payable or deliverable. In no event will Dividend Equivalents be payable or deliverable prior to the vesting date of the underlying Other Stock-Based Award. The number of any Dividend Equivalents credited to a Participant s Award upon the payment of a dividend on Common Shares will be equal to the quotient produced by dividing the cash value of the dividend by the Fair Market Value of one Share as of the date the dividend is paid. 4.7 Director Awards. (a) The Committee may grant Deferred Stock Units to each Director in such an amount as the Board, in its discretion, may approve in advance. Each such Deferred Stock Unit will vest as determined by the Committee and set forth in the Award Certificate and will be paid in Shares within 30 days following the recipient s Termination of Directorship, subject to deferral under any applicable deferred compensation plan approved by the Committee, in which case the terms of such arrangement shall govern. Dividend Equivalents or additional Deferred Stock Units will be credited to each Director s 
 15 

account when dividends are paid on Common Stock to the shareholders, and will be paid to the Director at the same time that the Deferred Stock Units are paid to the Director. (b) The Committee may grant Director Shares to each Director in such amounts as the Board, in its discretion, may approve in advance. (c) The Committee may, in its discretion, grant Stock Options, Stock Appreciation Rights and other Stock-Based Awards to Directors. 4.8 Substitute Awards. The Committee may make Awards under the Plan to Acquired Grantees through the assumption of, or in substitution for, outstanding stock-based awards previously granted to such Acquired Grantees by the Acquired Company. Such assumed or substituted Awards will be subject to the terms and conditions of the original awards made by the Acquired Company, with such adjustments therein as the Committee considers appropriate to give effect to the relevant provisions of any agreement for the acquisition of the Acquired Company, provided that any such adjustment with respect to Nonqualified Stock Options and Stock Appreciation Rights shall satisfy the requirements of Treas. Reg. 1.409A-1(b)(5)(v)(D) and otherwise ensure that such awards continue to be exempt from Code Section 409A and provided that any adjustment to Awards that are subject to Code Section 409A is in compliance with Code Section 409A and the regulations and rulings thereunder. Any grant of Incentive Stock Options pursuant to this Section 4.8 will be made in accordance with Section 424 of the Code and any final regulations published thereunder. 4.9 Limit on Individual Grants. Subject to Sections 5.1 and 5.3, no Employee may be granted more than 6 million Shares over any calendar year pursuant to Awards of Stock Options, Stock Appreciation Rights and performance- based Restricted Stock and performance-based Restricted Units, except that an incentive Award of no more than 10 million Shares may be made pursuant to Stock Options, Stock Appreciation Rights, performance-based Restricted Stock and performance-based Restricted Units (based upon the Award level as of the date of grant) to any person who has been hired within the calendar year as a Key Employee. The maximum amount that may be paid in cash or Shares pursuant to Annual Performance Bonuses or Long Term Performance Awards paid in Performance Units to any one Employee is 10 million (U.S.) (based upon the Award level as of the date of grant) for any Performance Cycle of 12 months. For any longer Performance Cycle, this maximum will be adjusted proportionally. 4.10 Termination for Cause; Clawback. (a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, if a Participant incurs a Termination of Directorship or Termination of Employment for Cause, then all Stock Options, Stock Appreciation Rights, Annual Performance Bonuses, Long Term Performance Awards, Restricted Units, Restricted Stock and other Stock-Based Awards are subject to immediate cancellation at the discretion of the Company. The exercise of any Stock Option or Stock Appreciation Right or the payment of any Award may be delayed, in the Company s discretion, in the event that a potential termination for Cause is pending, subject to ensuring an exemption from or compliance with Code Section 409A and the underlying regulations and rulings. If a Participant incurs a Termination of Employment for Cause, or the Company becomes aware (after the Participant s Termination of Employment) of conduct on the part of the Participant that would be grounds for a Termination of Employment for Cause, then, as determined in the discretion of the Company, the Participant will be required to deliver to the Company (i) Shares (or, in the discretion of the Committee, cash) in an amount that is equal in value to the amount of any profit the Participant realized upon the exercise of an Option during the period beginning six (6) months prior to the Participant s Termination of Employment and ending on the later of two (2) year anniversary of such Termination of Employment and the date you fully exercised any stock option granted hereunder; and (ii) the number of Shares (or, in the discretion of the Committee, the cash value of said shares) the Participant received for Restricted Shares, Restricted Units or other Stock-Based Awards that vested during the period described in (i) above. (b) In addition, any Award Certificate (or any part thereof) may provide for the cancellation or forfeiture of an Award or the forfeiture and repayment to the Company of any gain related to an award, or other provisions intended to have a similar effect, upon such terms and conditions as may be determined by the Committee in accordance with any Company claw-back or forfeiture policy, as may be amended from time to time, including as required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, or other applicable law, regulation or stock exchange listing requirement, as may be in effect from time to time, and which may operate to create additional rights for the Company with respect to awards and recovery of amounts relating thereto. By accepting Awards under the Plan, Participants agree and acknowledge that they are obligated to cooperate with, and provide any and all assistance necessary to, the Company to recover or recoup any award or amount paid under this Plan subject to claw-back pursuant to such law, government regulation, stock exchange listing requirement or Company policy. Such cooperation and assistance shall include, but is not limited to, executing, completing and submitting any documentation necessary to recover or recoup any award or amounts paid under this Plan from a Participant s accounts, or pending or future compensation awards.

ARTICLE V SHARES SUBJECT TO THE PLAN; ADJUSTMENTS 5.1 Shares Available. The Shares issuable under the Plan will be authorized but unissued Shares, and, to the extent permissible under applicable law, Shares acquired by the Company, any Subsidiary or any other person or entity designated by the Company. The shareholders of the Company have authorized for issuance the following number of Shares: (a) June 29, 2007: five percent (5 of the Shares outstanding as of that date; (b) March 10, 2010: an additional fifteen million (15,000,000) Shares; (c) March 7, 2012: an additional twenty million (20,000,000) Shares; and (d) March 8, 2017: an additional ten million (10,000,000) Shares, subject to adjustment in accordance with Section 5.3. No more than 10 million Shares of the total Shares issuable under the Plan may be available for grant in the form of Incentive Stock Options, subject to adjustment in accordance with Section 5.3. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 5.1, (i) when Shares are issued pursuant to a grant of Stock Options or Stock Appreciation Rights, the total number of Shares remaining available for grant will be decreased by one per Share issued, and (ii) when Shares are issued pursuant to a grant of Restricted Stock, Restricted Units, Deferred Stock Units, Performance Units or as payment of an Annual Performance Bonus or other Stock-Based Award, the total number of Shares remaining available for grant will be decreased by a margin of at least 1.8 per Share issued. In addition, in the case of the settlement of any stock-settled Stock Appreciation Right, the total number of Shares available for grant will be decreased by the total number of Shares underlying the Award, regardless of the number of Shares used to the Stock Appreciation Right on the day of settlement. 5.2 Counting Rules. The following Shares related to Awards under this Plan may again be available for issuance under the Plan, in addition to the Shares described in Section 5.1: (a) Shares related to Awards paid in cash; (b) Shares related to Awards that expire, are forfeited or cancelled or terminate for any other reason without issuance of Shares, and provided that each such forfeited, cancelled or terminated Share that was originally issued pursuant to a grant of Restricted Stock, Restricted Units, Deferred Stock Units, Performance Units or as payment of an Annual Performance Bonus or other Stock- Based Award shall be counted as 1.8 Shares; (c) Any Shares issued in connection with Awards that are assumed, converted or substituted as a result of the acquisition of an Acquired Company by the Company or a combination of the Company with another company; and (d) Any Shares of Restricted Stock that are returned to the Company upon a Participant s Termination of Employment. Shares that are (i) tendered by a Participant or withheld by the Company in payment of the exercise, base or purchase price relating to an Award, (ii) tendered by the Participant or withheld by the Company to satisfy any taxes or tax withholding obligations with respect to an Award, or (iii) not issued or delivered as a result of the net settlement of an outstanding Stock Option or Stock Appreciation Right under the Plan, as applicable, will not be available for future Awards under the Plan. 5.3 Adjustments. In the event of a change in the outstanding Shares by reason of a stock split, reverse stock split, dividend or other distribution (whether in the form of cash, Shares, other securities or other property), extraordinary cash dividend, recapitalization, merger, consolidation, split-up, spin-off, reorganization, combination, repurchase or exchange of Shares or other securities or similar corporate transaction or event, the Committee shall make an appropriate adjustment to prevent dilution or enlargement of the benefits or potential benefits intended to be made available under the Plan. Any such adjustment with respect to Nonqualified Stock Options and Stock Appreciation Rights shall satisfy the requirements of Treas. Reg. 1.409A-1(b)(5)(v)(D) and otherwise ensure that such awards continue to be exempt from Code Section 409A, and any adjustment to Awards that are subject to Code Section 409A shall comply with Code Section 409A and the regulations and rulings thereunder. Any adjustment made by the Committee under this Section 5.3 will be conclusive and binding for all purposes under the Plan. 
 17 

5.4 Change in Control. (a) Unless otherwise provided under the terms of an applicable Award Certificate, (i) all outstanding Stock Options and Stock Appreciation Rights will become exercisable as of the effective date of a Participant s Change in Control Termination if the Awards are not otherwise vested, and all conditions will be waived with respect to outstanding Restricted Stock, Restricted Units and other Stock-Based Awards (other than Long Term Performance Awards) and Deferred Stock Units, and (ii) each Participant who has been granted an Annual Performance Bonus or Long Term Performance Award that is outstanding as of the date of such Participant s Change in Control Termination will be deemed to have achieved a level of performance, as of the Change in Control Termination, that would cause all (100 of the Participant s Target Amounts to become payable, except with respect to portions of the Bonus or Award that have already been determined and certified by the Committee, in which case those portions of the Bonus or Award will become payable at the certified performance level. Unless the Committee determines otherwise in its discretion (either when the award is granted or any time thereafter), in the event that Awards outstanding as of the date of a Change in Control that are payable in shares of Company Common Stock will not be substituted with comparable awards payable or redeemable in shares of publicly-traded stock after the Change in Control, each such outstanding Award (i) will become fully vested (at target, where applicable) immediately prior to the Change in Control and (ii) each such Award that is a Stock Option will be settled in cash, without the Participant s consent, for an amount equal to the amount that could have been attained upon the exercise of such Award immediately prior to the Change in Control had such Award been exercisable or payable at such time. (b) In addition to or in lieu of the other actions described in Section 5.4(a), the Committee has the authority in the event of a Change in Control to exercise its discretion in good faith to take such other actions with respect to outstanding Awards as are deemed reasonable and appropriate under the circumstances to assure that the value of such Awards and Participants opportunities to recognize the value of such Awards are preserved. Such actions may be taken without the consent of the Participant and may include without limitation the following: (i) the Committee may determine that outstanding Stock Options and Stock Appreciation Rights shall be fully exercisable, and restrictions on Restricted Stock, Restricted Units, Deferred Stock Units and other Stock-Based Awards shall lapse, as of the date of the Change in Control or such other time (prior to a Participant s Change in Control Termination) as the Committee determines appropriate under the existing circumstances, (ii) the Committee may require that a Participant surrender outstanding Stock Options and Stock Appreciation Rights in exchange for one or more payments by the Company, in cash or Common Stock as determined by the Committee, in an amount equal to the amount by which the then Fair Market Value of the shares of Common Stock subject to the Participant s unexercised Stock Options and Stock Appreciation Rights exceeds the exercise price, if any, and on such terms as the Committee determines (it being understood that if the per share Fair Market Value is less than or equal to the per share exercise price, the Stock Option or Stock Appreciation Right, as applicable, shall be cancelled for no consideration), (iii) after giving Participants an opportunity to exercise their outstanding Stock Options and Stock Appreciation Rights, the Committee may terminate any or all unexercised Stock Options and Stock Appreciation Rights at such time as the Committee deems appropriate, (iv) the Committee may determine that Annual Performance Bonuses and/or Long Term Performance Awards will be paid out at their target level, in cash or Common Stock as determined by the Committee, or (v) the Committee may determine that Awards that remain outstanding after the Change in Control shall be converted to similar grants of, or assumed by, the surviving corporation (or a parent or subsidiary of the surviving corporation or successor). Such acceleration, surrender, termination, settlement or conversion shall take place as of the date of the Change in Control or such other date as the Committee may specify. The Committee may specify how an Award will be treated in the event of a Change in Control either when the Award is granted or at any time thereafter, including without limitation by approval of language included in an agreement entered into by the Company in connection with a Change in Control, except as otherwise provided herein. 5.5 Fractional Shares. No fractional Shares will be issued under the Plan. Except as otherwise provided in Section 4.5(e), if a Participant acquires the right to receive a fractional Share under the Plan, the Participant will receive, in lieu of the fractional Share, a full Share as of the date of settlement, unless otherwise provided by the Committee. 
 18 

ARTICLE VI AMENDMENT AND TERMINATION 6.1 Amendment. The Plan may be amended at any time and from time to time by the Board without the approval of stockholders of the Company, except that no material revision to the terms of the Plan will be effective until the amendment is approved by the stockholders of the Company. A revision is material for this purpose if, among other changes, it materially increases the number of Shares that may be issued under the Plan (other than an increase pursuant to Section 5.3), expands the types of Awards available under the Plan, materially expands the class of persons eligible to receive Awards under the Plan, materially extends the term of the Plan, materially decreases the Exercise Price at which Stock Options or Stock Appreciation Rights may be granted, reduces the Exercise Price of outstanding Stock Options or Stock Appreciation Rights, or results in the replacement of outstanding Stock Options and Stock Appreciation Rights with new Awards that have an Exercise Price that is lower than the Exercise Price of the replaced Stock Options and Stock Appreciation Rights, or if approval by stockholders of the Company is necessary to comply with any applicable law, tax or regulatory requirement, or listing requirement of the New York Stock Exchange or any other national exchange on which the Shares are listed, for which or with which the Board deems it necessary or desirable to qualify or comply. No amendment of the Plan or any outstanding Award made without the Participant s written consent may materially impact any right of a Participant with respect to an outstanding Award. 6.2 Termination. The Plan will terminate upon the earlier of the following dates or events to occur: (a) the adoption of a resolution of the Board terminating the Plan; or (b) June 27, 2027. No Awards will be granted under this Plan after it has terminated. The termination of the Plan, however, will not alter or impair any of the rights or obligations of any person under any Award previously granted under the Plan without such person s consent. After the termination of the Plan, any previously granted Awards will remain in effect and will continue to be governed by the terms of the Plan and the applicable Award Certificate. ARTICLE VII GENERAL PROVISIONS 7.1 Nontransferability of Awards. Effective March 8, 2017, no Award under the Plan (regardless of when granted) will be subject in any manner to alienation, anticipation, sale, assignment, pledge, encumbrance or transfer, and no other persons will otherwise acquire any rights therein, except by will or by the laws of descent or distribution. Restricted Stock may be freely transferred after the restrictions lapse or are satisfied and the Shares are delivered, provided, however, that Restricted Stock awarded to an affiliate of the Company may be transferred only pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act, or pursuant to an effective registration for resale under the Securities Act. For purposes of this subsection (d), affiliate will have the meaning assigned to that term under Rule 144. 7.2 Withholding of Taxes. The Committee, in its discretion, may satisfy a Participant s tax withholding obligations by any of the following methods or any method as it determines to be in accordance with the laws of the jurisdiction in which the Participant resides, has domicile or performs services. (a) Stock Options and Stock Appreciation Rights. As a condition to the delivery of Shares pursuant to the exercise of a Stock Option or Stock Appreciation Right, the Committee may require that the Participant, at the time of exercise, pay to the Company by cash, certified check, bank draft, wire transfer or postal or express money order an amount sufficient to satisfy any applicable tax withholding obligations. The Committee may also, in its discretion, accept payment of tax withholding obligations through any of the Exercise Price payment methods described in Section 4.3(d). (b) Other Awards Payable in Shares. The Participant shall satisfy the Participant s tax withholding obligations arising in connection with the release of restrictions on Restricted Units, Restricted Stock and other Stock- Based Awards by payment to the Company in cash or by certified check, bank draft, wire transfer or postal or express money order, provided that the format is approved by the Company or a designated third-party administrator. However, subject to any requirements of applicable law, the Company may also satisfy the Participant s tax withholding obligations by other methods, including selling or withholding Shares that would otherwise be available for delivery, provided that the Board or the Committee has specifically approved such payment method in advance. 
 19 

(c) Cash Awards. The Company may satisfy a Participant s tax withholding obligation arising in connection with the payment of any Award in cash by withholding cash from such payment. 7.3 Special Forfeiture Provision. The Committee may, in its discretion, provide in an Award Certificate that if the Participant engages in acts that are deemed to be detrimental to the best interests of the Company, including without limitation, (i) any breach of the Company s Guide to Ethical Conduct or engagement in any other act that could result in the Participant s Termination of Employment for Cause, or (ii) the Participant s engagement in activities that are deemed to be competitive or potentially competitive to the interests of the Company or any Subsidiary, including entering into any employment or consultation arrangement with any entity or person engaged in any business in which the Company or any Subsidiary is engaged without prior written approval of the Company if, in the sole judgment of the Company, the business is competitive with the Company or any Subsidiary or business unit or such employment or consultation arrangement would present a risk that the Participant would likely disclose Company proprietary information (as determined by the Company), then the Participant s outstanding Awards can be forfeited and any profits realized or Shares delivered as a result of the payment, vesting or exercise of Awards before or after the Participant s Termination of Employment will be subject to forfeiture and reimbursement to the Company under such terms and conditions as are deemed appropriate by the Committee. 7.4 No Implied Rights. The establishment and operation of the Plan, including the eligibility of a Participant to participate in the Plan, will not be construed as conferring any legal or other right upon any Director for any continuation of directorship or any Employee for the continuation of employment through the end of any Performance Cycle or other period. The Company expressly reserves the right, which may be exercised at any time and in the Company s sole discretion, to discharge any individual or treat him or her without regard to the effect such discharge might have upon him or her as a Participant in the Plan. 7.5 No Obligation to Exercise Awards. The grant of a Stock Option or Stock Appreciation Right will impose no obligation upon the Participant to exercise the Award. 7.6 No Rights as Stockholders. A Participant who is granted an Award under the Plan will have no rights as a stockholder of the Company with respect to the Award unless and until certificates for the Shares underlying the Award are registered in the Participant s name and (other than in the case of Restricted Stock) delivered to the Participant. The right of any Participant to receive an Award by virtue of participation in the Plan will be no greater than the right of any unsecured general creditor of the Company. 7.7 Indemnification of Committee. The Company will indemnify, to the fullest extent permitted by law, each person made or threatened to be made a party to any civil or criminal action or proceeding by reason of the fact that the person, or the executor or administrator of the person s estate, is or was a member of the Committee or a delegate of the Committee. 7.8 No Required Segregation of Assets. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary will be required to segregate any assets that may at any time be represented by Awards granted pursuant to the Plan. 7.9 Nature of Payments. All Awards made pursuant to the Plan are in consideration of services for the Company or a Subsidiary. Any gain realized pursuant to Awards under the Plan constitutes a special incentive payment to the Participant and will not be taken into account as compensation for purposes of any other employee benefit plan of the Company or a Subsidiary, except as the Committee otherwise provides. The adoption of the Plan will have no effect on Awards made or to be made under any other benefit plan covering an employee of the Company or a Subsidiary or any predecessor or successor of the Company or a Subsidiary. 7.10 Securities Law Compliance. Awards under the Plan are intended to satisfy the requirements of Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act. If any provision of this Plan or any grant of an Award would otherwise frustrate or conflict with this intent, that provision will be interpreted and deemed amended so as to avoid conflict. No Participant will be entitled to a grant, exercise, transfer or payment of any Award if the grant, exercise, transfer or payment would violate the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 or any other applicable law. 7.11 Section 409A Compliance. To the extent applicable, it is intended that the Plan and all Awards hereunder comply with, or be exempt from, the requirements of Section 409A of the Code and the Treasury Regulations and other guidance issued thereunder, and that the Plan and all Award Agreements shall be interpreted and applied by the Committee in a manner consistent with this intent in order to avoid the imposition of any additional tax under Section 409A of the Code. To the extent any Award granted under the Plan either qualifies for an exemption from the requirements of Section 409A of the Code or is subject to Section 409A of the Code, the Plan and the Award Certificate will be interpreted such that the Award qualifies for an exemption or, if Section 409A of the Code is applicable, in accordance with Section 409A of the Code and Department of Treasury regulations and other interpretive guidance issued thereunder, including without limitation any such 
 20 

regulations or other guidance that may be issued after the Effective Date. Notwithstanding any provision of the Plan, in the event that the Committee determines that any Award may be subject to Section 409A of the Code, the Committee may adopt such amendments to the Plan and/or the applicable Award Certificate or adopt policies and procedures or take any other action or actions, including an action or amendment with retroactive effect, that the Committee determines is necessary or appropriate to (i) exempt the Award from the application of Section 409A of the Code or (ii) comply with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code. Any Award that provides for a payment to any Participant who is a specified employee of deferred compensation that is subject to Code Section 409A(a)(2) and that becomes payable upon, or that is accelerated upon, such Participant s Termination of Employment, shall not be made on or before the date which is six months following such Participant s Termination of Employment (or, if earlier, such Participant s death). A specified employee for this purpose shall be determined by the Committee or its delegate in accordance with the provisions of Code Section 409A and the regulations and rulings thereunder. If a grant under the Plan is subject to Section 409A of the Code, then (i) distributions shall only be made in a manner and upon an event permitted under Section 409A of the Code, (ii) payments to be made upon termination of employment shall only be made upon a separation from service under Section 409A of the Code, (iii) unless the grant agreement specifies otherwise, each installment payment shall be treated as a separate payment for purposes of Section 409A of the Code, and (iv) in no event shall a Participant, directly or indirectly, designate the calendar year in which a distribution is made except as permitted in accordance with Section 409A of the Code. Neither a Participant nor any of a Participant s creditors or beneficiaries shall have the right to subject any deferred compensation (within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code) payable under the Plan and grants of deferred compensation hereunder to any anticipation, alienation, sale, transfer, assignment, pledge, encumbrance, attachment or garnishment. Except as permitted under Section 409A of the Code, any deferred compensation (within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code) payable to a Participant or for a Participant s benefit under the Plan and grants of deferred compensation hereunder may not be reduced by, or offset against, any amount owing by a Participant to the Company or any of its affiliates. In any case, a Participant shall be solely responsible and liable for the satisfaction of all taxes and penalties that may be imposed on a Participant or for a Participant s account in connection with the Plan and grants hereunder (including any taxes, interest and/or penalties under Section 409A of the Code), and neither the Company nor any of its affiliates shall have any obligation to indemnify or otherwise hold a Participant harmless from any or all of such taxes, interest and/or penalties. 7.12 Governing Law, Severability. The Plan and all determinations made and actions taken under the Plan will be governed by the law of Switzerland and construed accordingly. If any provision of the Plan is held unlawful or otherwise invalid or unenforceable in whole or in part, the unlawfulness, invalidity or unenforceability will not affect any other parts of the Plan, which parts will remain in full force and effect. 7.13. Non U.S. Participants . In order to facilitate the making of any grant or combination of grants under the Plan, the Committee may provide for such special terms for awards to Participants who are foreign nationals or who are employed by the Company or any Subsidiary outside of the United States of America or who provide services to the Company under an agreement with a foreign nation or agency, as the Committee may consider necessary or appropriate to accommodate differences in local law, tax policy or custom, to comply with applicable foreign laws or facilitate the offering and administration of the Plan in view of such foreign laws and to allow for tax-preferred treatment of Awards. Moreover, the Committee may approve such supplements to or amendments, restatements or alternative versions of the Plan (including, without limitation, sub-plans) and modify exercise procedures, and other terms and procedures, as it may consider necessary or appropriate for such purposes, without thereby affecting the terms of the Plan as in effect for any other purpose, and the Secretary or other appropriate officer of the Company may certify any such document as having been approved and adopted in the same manner as the Plan. No such special terms, supplements, amendments, restatements, sub-plans or modifications, however, will include any provisions that are inconsistent with the terms of the Plan as then in effect unless the Plan could have been amended to eliminate such inconsistency without further approval by the shareholders of the Company.

The Company matching contribution will be paid on employee contributions made to the Plan up to a maximum annual contribution of 40,000 (US). For purposes of determining the Company s maximum annual contribution in countries outside the United States, the U.S. dollar equivalent of the 40,000 employee contribution (or other designated annual employee contribution) for any calendar year will be based on the exchange rate in effect on the first business day of December of the prior calendar year. The Committee, from time to time, may increase or decrease the percentage of the Company s contribution to the Participant s payroll deduction if the interests of the Company so require. The matching contributions hereunder are not intended to be entitled or part of the regular compensation of any Participant. The Company will pay all commissions relating to the purchase of the Shares under the Plan, and the Company will pay all administrative costs associated with the implementation and operation of the Plan. ARTICLE 7 AUTHORIZATION FOR ENTERING THE PLAN An eligible employee may enter the Plan by enrolling in the Plan and specifying his/her contribution amount in the manner authorized by the Company. Such authorization will take effect as of the next practicable payroll period. Unless a Participant authorizes changes to his/her payroll deductions in accordance with Article 5 or withdraws from the Plan, his/her deductions under the latest authorization on file with the Company shall continue from one payment period to the succeeding payment period as long as the Plan remains in effect. ARTICLE 8 PURCHASE OF SHARES All Shares purchased under the Plan which are purchased on the open market shall be purchased by a broker designated, from time to time, by the Committee. On a monthly basis, as soon as practicable following the month end, the Company shall remit the total of contributions to the broker for the purchase of the Shares. The broker will then execute the purchase order and the Plan Administrator shall allocate Shares (or fraction thereof) to each participant s individual recordkeeping account. In the event the purchase of Shares takes place over a number of days and at different prices, then each participant s allocation shall be adjusted on the basis of the average price per Share over such period. All Shares issued to the Plan from newly-issued or Treasury Shares will be allocated to Participants accounts as of the eighth trading day of the month and will be allocated based on the average of the high and low prices of the Company s stock on the New York Stock exchange on such date. ARTICLE 9 ISSUANCE OF SHARES Unless otherwise determined by the Committee or its designee, the Shares purchased under the Plan shall be held by the Plan Administrator or its nominee. Participants shall receive annual statements that will evidence all activity in the accounts that have been established on their behalf. Such statements will be issued by the Plan Administrator or its nominee. Participants may also review periodic statements electronically if provided more frequently than annually by the Plan Administrator. In the event a Participant wishes to hold certificates in his/her own name, the Participant must instruct the Plan Administrator or its nominee independently and bear the costs associated with the issuance of such certificates and pay, if required, a fee for each certificate so issued. Fractional Shares shall be liquidated on a cash basis only in lieu of the issuance of certificates for such fractional Shares upon the employee s withdrawal. ARTICLE 10 SALE OF SHARES PURCHASED UNDER THE PLAN Each Participant may sell at any time all or any portion of the Shares acquired under the Plan by notifying the Plan Administrator, or its designee, who will direct the broker to execute the sale on behalf of the Participant. The Participant shall pay the broker s commission and any other expenses incurred with regard to the sale of the 
 2 

Shares. All such sales of the Shares will be subject to compliance with any applicable federal or state securities, tax or other laws. Each participant assumes the risk of any fluctuations in the market price of the Shares. ARTICLE 11 WITHDRAWAL FROM THE PLAN A Participant may cease making contributions to the Plan at any time by changing his/her payroll deduction to zero as described in Article 5. In order to execute a sale of all or part of the Shares purchased under the Plan, the Participant must contact the Plan Administrator, or its designee, directly. If the Participant desires to withdraw from the Plan by liquidating all or part of his/her shareholder interest, he/she shall receive the proceeds from the sale thereof, minus the commission and other expenses on such sale. ARTICLE 12 NO TRANSFER OR ASSIGNMENT A Participant s right to purchase Shares under the Plan through payroll deduction is his/hers alone and may not be transferred or assigned to, or availed of, by any other person. ARTICLE 13 TERMINATION OF EMPLOYEE RIGHTS All of the employee s rights under the Plan will terminate when he/she ceases to be an eligible employee due to retirement, resignation, death, termination, or any other reason. A notice of withdrawal will be deemed to have been received from a Participant on the day of his/her final payroll deduction. If a Participant s payroll deductions are interrupted by any legal process, a withdrawal notice will be deemed as having been received on the day the interruption occurs. ARTICLE 14 TERMINATION AND AMENDMENT TO THE PLAN The Plan may be terminated at any time by the Company s Board of Directors if the interests of the Company so require. Upon such termination, or any other termination of the Plan, all payroll deductions not used to purchase Shares will be refunded. The Board of Directors also reserves the right to amend the Plan, from time to time, in any respect and authorizes the Committee to approve amendments to the Plan on its behalf. ARTICLE 15 LOCAL TAX LAWS If the provisions of the Plan contradict local tax laws, the local tax laws shall prevail.

TE CONNECTIVITY SUPPLEMENTAL SAVINGS AND RETIREMENT PLAN ARTICLE I Purpose 
 1.1 Supplemental Savings and Retirement Plan . The name of this plan is the TE Connectivity Supplemental Savings and Retirement Plan (prior to January 1, 2017, the Tyco Electronics Corporation Supplemental Savings and Retirement Plan) (the Plan ). The Plan was originally effective as of the separation of Tyco Electronics Ltd. and its underlying Subsidiaries (as defined in Section 2.11(a) )from the Tyco International Ltd. controlled group of corporations (the Separation ), which occurred on June 29, 2007 Original Effective Date ). The Plan was created as a spin-off from and was a continuation of the Tyco Supplemental Savings and Retirement Plan Tyco SSRP with respect to the Accounts of certain Participants who were aligned with the Tyco Electronics business unit in conjunction with the Separation. The Plan was also created to provide certain of the key employees of the Company and the key employees of its parents, Subsidiaries and affiliates with the ability to defer receipt of compensation that would otherwise be payable to them and to make up for amounts that could not be contributed on their behalf as matching contributions under the TE Connectivity Retirement Savings and Investment Plan (f/k/a the Tyco Electronics Corporation Retirement Savings and Investment Plan) due to certain restrictions applicable under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code ). This amendment and restatement of the Plan, effective as of January 1, 2018 (the Restated Effective Date ), is intended, except for amounts that were deferred and vested as of December 31, 2004, to be interpreted and applied so as to comply in all respects with the provisions of Section 409A of the Code and regulations and rulings promulgated thereunder and, if necessary, any provision shall be held null and void to the extent such provision (or part thereof) fails to comply with Section 409A or the regulations promulgated thereunder. 
 
 Effective January 1, 2017, the name of the Company, Tyco Electronics Corporation, changed to TE Connectivity Corporation, and the name of the Plan was changed to the TE Connectivity Supplemental Savings and Retirement Plan. These name changes have no impact on the benefits accrued, eligibility of persons to participate in the Plan, or rights of Participants under the Plan. 1.2 Benefits Under the Tyco SSRP and the Plan . With respect to each Participant (or Beneficiary, as applicable) who participated in the Tyco SSRP prior to the Separation and who was aligned with the Tyco Electronics business unit, Tyco International Management Company transferred from the Tyco SSRP to such Participant s or Beneficiary s Account under the Plan an amount equal to the value of the notional accounts credited to the Participant or Beneficiary under the Tyco SSRP immediately prior to such transfer. Benefits for any Participant or Beneficiary that were credited under the Tyco SSRP prior to the Original Effective Date and that were transferred to this Plan will be determined in accordance with the provisions of the Tyco SSRP (and, if applicable, under the Tyco Deferred Compensation Plan for deferrals prior to January 1, 2005), but paid under this Plan unless modifications to such transferred benefits are 

 1 

specifically provided herein or by a subsequent amendment to this Plan, or if an election contemplated under Section 10.21 is made available. Benefits credited on and after the Original Effective Date and before the Restated Effective Date shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of this Plan as originally adopted on June 29, 2007 and any administrative actions taken thereunder to comply in good faith with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code and the regulations and rulings promulgated thereunder, unless modifications to such benefits are specifically provided herein or by a subsequent amendment to this Plan, or if an election contemplated under Section 10.21 is made available. Benefits credited on and after the Restated Effective Date shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of this Plan as amended and restated herein. 
 1.3 Transfer of Accounts as a Result of the BNS Divesture . Effective as of the closing date of the corporate transaction described in the Stock and Asset Purchase Agreement by and among TE Connectivity, Ltd., CommScope Holding Company, Inc., and CommScope, Inc. dated January 27, 2015 (the BNS Divestiture ), the Accounts of Plan participants in the Broadband Network Solutions business unit who are terminated as a result of the BNS Divestiture will be transferred out of the Plan to the plan established by CommScope, Inc. to receive such accounts. 
 1.4 Changes to the Plan as the Result of Changes to the Matching Contribution Structure of the Tyco Electronics Corporation Retirement Savings and Investment Plan . The RSIP (as defined in Section 2.36 was amended, effective January 1, 2016, to provide Non-Standard Matching Contribution Structures for certain acquired business units or Affiliated Companies that are different from the Standard Matching Contribution Structure under the RSIP. The Plan was amended to provide that employees (who would otherwise be Eligible Employees) of any business unit or Affiliated Company that adopts a Non-Standard Matching Contribution Structure rather than the Standard Matching Contribution Structure will be excluded from participation in the Plan, until the Annual Enrollment Period coincident with or immediately following the date the business unit or the Affiliated Company adopts the Standard Matching Contribution Structure or the employee transfers to another business unit or Affiliated Company that provides the Standard Matching Contribution Structure. 
 1.5 Plan Amendments . The Plan is amended, generally effective January 1, 2021, to reflect that RSIP Elections will be determined based on both the Participant s pre-tax and/or Roth percentage election in the RSIP. The Plan was previously amended, generally effective January 1, 2018, to incorporate prior amendments, to change the name of the Plan from the Tyco Electronics Corporation Supplemental Savings and Retirement Plan to the TE Connectivity Supplemental Savings and Retirement Plan (effective January 1, 2017), to automatically extend eligibility to Eligible Employees in Band 4, and to provide that Company contributions will only be made to Participants who are actively participating in the Plan. 
 1.6 Deferred Compensation Plan . The Company intends that the Plan shall at all times be maintained on an unfunded basis for federal income tax purposes under the Code, and administered as a non-qualified, top hat plan exempt from the substantive requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended 

 2

 5.3 Deferral Limits . The Plan Administrator may change the minimum or maximum deferral percentages from time to time. Any such limits shall be communicated by the Plan Administrator prior to the due date for the Enrollment and Payment Agreement.

 5.4 Period of Commitment .

Such election shall be deemed an irrevocable commitment by such Participant to defer hereunder a percentage of his or her periodic Compensation equal to the Participant s RSIP Election for such Plan Year, with such deferrals commencing at the time the Participant s pretax and Roth RSIP contributions are suspended for the Plan Year as the result of the imposition of any limitation under the RSIP or applicable law or any procedure established by the Plan Administrator in accordance with applicable law and continuing for the remainder of the Plan Year; provided that a Participant who elects to make Spillover Deferrals will be deemed to have made a commitment to maintain his or her RSIP Election in effect for the entire Plan Year (up to the time of such suspension) without change. An individual who first becomes an Eligible Employee on or after the last Saturday in October of any Plan Year but prior to December 31 of such Plan Year may file a Spillover Deferral election described in this Section 6.1 effective for the next Plan Year, no later than such December 31 . 
 
 Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent necessary, the Plan Administrator may permit an Administrative Error Correction. 6.2 Matching Credits . An Eligible Employee who has elected to make Compensation Deferrals for a Plan Year shall receive Matching Credits, equal to the Participant s Maximum Matching Percentage multiplied by (i) the dollar amount of the Participant s Compensation Deferrals under Section 5.1 for such Plan Year on Compensation up to the 

 13 

applicable annual dollar limitation set forth in Section 401(a)(17) of the Code, and (ii) the amount of Compensation for such Plan Year from which Spillover Deferrals (if any) are made under Section 6.1 (disregarding any such Compensation that exceeds the applicable annual dollar limitation set forth in Section 401(a)(17) of the Code). For purposes of this Section 6.2 , the Participant s Maximum Matching Percentage each payroll period during the Plan Year will equal the matching percentage credited to the Participant s tax-deferred contributions and Roth contributions under RSIP during that same period. If the Participant is deferring amounts under this Plan, but is not making tax-deferred or Roth contributions to the RSIP during a particular payroll period, then the Maximum Matching Percentage for that payroll period shall be the lowest matching percentage available under RSIP; provided, however, that any Participant who, during the Plan Year, transfers to a business unit or to an Affiliated Company that has adopted a Non-Standard Matching Contribution Structure, and by reason of such transfer is no longer an Eligible Employee, shall continue to have the same Maximum Matching Percentage apply that was in effect prior to the transfer for the remainder of the Plan Year during which the Participant has an irrevocable deferral election but is not otherwise an Eligible Employee. Matching Credits shall be credited to a Participant s Account at such time or times as may be determined by the Plan Administrator in its sole discretion, but in no event less frequently than annually. 
 6.3 Company Credits . A Participant who has elected to make Compensation Deferrals for a Plan Year shall receive Company Credits for such Plan Year in an amount equal to the Participant s Maximum Matching Percentage for such Plan Year multiplied by the Participant s Compensation in excess of the annual dollar limitation set forth in Section 401(a)(17) of the Code for such Plan Year; provided, however, that no Company Credit will be made to a Participant unless the Participant is actively participating in the Plan by making Compensation Deferrals. For purposes of this Section 6.3 , the Participant s Maximum Matching Percentage will equal the matching percentage credited to the Participant s tax-deferred contributions and Roth contributions under RSIP at the point that either the Section 402(g) limit is reached or the Section 401(a)(17) limit is exceeded; provided, however, that any Participant who, during the Plan Year, transfers to a business unit or to an Affiliated Company that has adopted a Non-Standard Matching Contribution Structure, and by reason of such transfer is no longer an Eligible Employee, shall continue to have the same Maximum Matching Percentage apply that was in effect prior to the transfer for the remainder of the Plan Year during which the Participant has an irrevocable deferral election but is not otherwise an Eligible Employee. Company Credits shall be credited to a Participant s Account at such time or times as may be determined by the Plan Administrator in its sole discretion, but in no event less frequently than annually, as of the last day of a Plan Year. A Participant who has elected to make Compensation Deferrals for a Plan Year, and who receives a Company Credit for such Plan Year, shall have the portion of his or her Account attributable to such Company Credit, if vested, distributed as specified in his or her Enrollment and Payment Agreement for such Plan Year. Prior to the Restated Effective Date, a Participant who has not elected to make Compensation Deferrals for a Plan Year, but who receives a Company Credit for such Plan Year (and has not previously received any Company Credit under the Plan), shall file with the Plan Administrator an Enrollment and Payment Agreement as soon as practicable (but no later than 30 days) after becoming eligible for 

 14 

such Company Credit, electing the timing and form of payment of the portion of the Participant s Account attributable to such Company Credit, if vested. Such election shall be deemed to apply also to any Company Credit received in any future Plan Year for which the Participant does not have in effect an Enrollment and Payment Agreement. If such Participant does not file an Enrollment and Payment Agreement by the date specified by the Plan Administrator, he or she shall be deemed to have elected to have the portion of his or her Account attributable to such Company Credit, and each Company Credit received in a future Plan Year for which the Participant does not have in effect an Enrollment and Payment Agreement, paid (if vested) as a Specified Date Payment in a single lump sum in the fifth Plan Year following the Plan Year for which each such Company Credit was received . 
 6.4 Discretionary Credits . A Participant who is an Eligible Employee for any Plan Year may receive a Discretionary Credit for such Plan Year. Such credit shall be in such amount as may be determined by the Company in its sole discretion, and shall be credited to the Participant s Account at such time or times as may be determined by the Company in its sole discretion. A Participant who has elected to make Compensation Deferrals for a Plan Year, and who receives a Discretionary Credit for such Plan Year, shall have the portion of his or her Account attributable to such Discretionary Credit (if vested) distributed as specified in his or her Enrollment and Payment Agreement for such Plan Year. A Participant who has not elected to make Compensation Deferrals for a Plan Year, but who receives a Discretionary Credit for such Plan Year (and has not previously received any Discretionary Credit under the Plan), shall file with the Plan Administrator an Enrollment and Payment Agreement as soon as practicable (but no later than 30 days) after becoming eligible for such Discretionary Credit, electing the timing and form of payment of the portion of the Participant s Account attributable to such Discretionary Credit (if vested). Such election shall be deemed to apply also to any Discretionary Credit received in any future Plan Year for which the Participant does not have in effect an Enrollment and Payment Agreement. If such Participant does not file an Enrollment and Payment Agreement by the date specified by the Plan Administrator, he or she shall be deemed to have elected to have the portion of his or her Account attributable to such Discretionary Credit, and each Discretionary Credit received in a future Plan Year for which the Participant does not have in effect an Enrollment and Payment Agreement, paid (if vested) as a Specified Date Payment in a single lump sum in the fifth Plan Year following the Plan Year for which each such Discretionary Credit was received. 
 6.5 Vesting of Matching, Company and Discretionary Credits . Effective October 1, 2017, Participants who are actively employed on or after September 29, 2017 shall become 100 vested in their past and future Matching Credits and Company Credits (subject to Section 10.12 ).

The portion of a Participant Account attributable to Discretionary Credits shall become 100 vested upon the date and/or upon 

 15 

the occurrence of the event(s) specified by the Company in its sole discretion (subject to Section 10.12 ).

A Conditional Specified Date Payment shall be made, or shall commence, within 60 days of the March 1 st of the year following the year in which the applicable payment trigger occurs. For the avoidance of doubt, any Specified Date Payment elected prior to October 1, 2017 that references the date the Participant is vested shall be interpreted to mean the date the Participant would have been vested based on the Plan s vesting schedule at the time the Specified Date Payment was elected. The changes to the Plan s vesting schedule, effective October 1, 2017, shall not change or accelerate any Specified Payment Date. 
 8.2 Change in Election .

 17 

the date of the first scheduled installment payment), provided that such new election delays the payment year by at least five years from the original payment year, and provided, further, that such change in election shall not be effective until 12 months from the date it is filed. A Participant s reemployment following the commencement of installment payments shall not cause any suspension or interruption in such installment payments. The provisions of this Section 8.2 shall apply to all change elections made on or after January 1, 2009; change elections made prior to such date shall be governed by Section 10.2 . 
 8.3 Cash-Out Payments .

 8.5 Valuation of Payments . Any lump sum benefit under Sections 8.1 , 8.2 or 8.3 shall be payable in an amount equal to the value of the Participant s Account (or relevant portion thereof) as of the trading day immediately preceding the relevant payment date, with the Measurement Funds being deemed to have been liquidated on that date to make the payment. The first annual installment payment in a series of installment payments shall be equal to (i) the value of the Participant s Account (or relevant portion thereof) as of the trading day immediately preceding the relevant payment date, with the Measurement Funds being deemed to have been liquidated on that date to make the payment, divided by (ii) the number of installment payments elected by the Participant. The remaining installments shall be paid in an amount equal to (a) the value of such Account (or relevant portion thereof) as of the trading day immediately preceding the relevant payment date, with the Measurement Funds being deemed to have been liquidated on that date to make the payment, divided by (b) the number of remaining unpaid installment payments. For purposes of this Section, trading day means a day that the New York Stock Exchange (or, if applicable, any other recognized national securities exchange) is open for business.

 18 

8.7 (but in no event to exceed the maximum permitted amount determined under Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(ii) of the Code). 
 8.7 Withholding Taxes .

Each Participant, however, shall be responsible for the payment of all individual tax liabilities relating to any such benefits. 
 8.8 Effect of Payment . The full payment of the applicable benefit under this ARTICLE VIII shall completely discharge all obligations on the part of the Company to the Participant (and each Beneficiary) with respect to the operation of this Plan, and the Participant s (and Beneficiary s) rights under this Plan shall terminate. 
 8.9 Special Payment Rules for Tyco Deferred Compensation Plan DCP Accounts . Unless a Participant has made a revised election under Section 8.2 or 10.21 , payment of the Participant s account attributable to amounts that were previously deferred under the DCP will be made or commence at the time specified under the terms of the DCP, but the form of payment will be governed by the terms of the election made by the Participant with respect to the account, notwithstanding DCP rules that would invalidate the form of payment, provided, however, that the value of the Participant s Account balance is at least 10,000. 
 8.10 Aggregation of Account Balance Plans . Pursuant to Treas. Reg. Section 1.409A-1(c)(2), all account balance plans, as defined in Treas. Reg. Section 1.409A-1(c)(2)(A)(1)-(2), including the Plan, shall be treated as deferred under a single plan. 
 
 ARTICLE IX Claims Procedures 
 9.1 Filing a Claim . Any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to the Plan shall be filed in writing with the Plan Administrator in accordance with the Plan Administrator s procedures. The Plan Administrator shall make all determinations concerning such claim. Any decision by the Plan Administrator denying such claim shall be in writing using language calculated to be understood by the Participant and shall be delivered to the Participant or Beneficiary filing the claim Claimant ). 
 (a) In General . Notice of a denial of benefits (other than Disability benefits) will be provided within 90 days of the Plan Administrator s receipt of the Claimant s claim for benefits. If the Plan Administrator determines that it needs additional time to review the claim, the Plan Administrator will provide the Claimant with a notice of the extension before the end of the initial 90-day period. The extension will not be more than 90 days from the end of the initial 90-day period, and the notice of extension will explain the special circumstances that require the extension and the date by which the Plan Administrator expects to make a decision. 

 19 

(b) Disability Benefits . Notice of denial of Disability benefits will be provided within 45 days of the Plan Administrator s receipt of the Claimant s claim for Disability benefits (unless such period is extended, as provided below). If the Plan Administrator determines that it needs additional time to review the Disability claim, the 45-day period may be extended by the Plan Administrator for up to 30 days. The Plan Administrator will provide the Claimant with a notice of the extension before the end of the initial 45-day period. If the Plan Administrator determines that a decision cannot be made within the first 30-day extension due to matters beyond the control of the Plan Administrator, the period for making a determination may be further extended for an additional 30 days. If such an additional extension is necessary, the Plan Administrator shall notify the Claimant prior to the expiration of the initial 30-day extension. Any notice of extension shall indicate the circumstances necessitating the extension of time, the date by which the Plan Administrator expects to furnish a notice of decision, the standards on which entitlement to a benefit is based, the unresolved issues that prevent a decision on the claim, and any additional information needed to resolve those issues. A Claimant will be provided a minimum of 45 days to submit any necessary additional information to the Plan Administrator. In the event that a 30-day extension is necessary due to a Claimant s failure to submit information necessary to decide a claim, the period for furnishing a notice of decision shall be tolled from the date on which the notice of the extension is sent to the Claimant until the earlier of the date the Claimant responds to the request for additional information or the response deadline. 
 (c) Contents of Notice . If a claim for benefits is completely or partially denied, notice of such denial shall include a written explanation, using language calculated to be understood by the Participant. 
 (i) The decision shall set forth (a) the specific reason or reasons for such denial; (b) specific reference(s) to the relevant provision(s) of this Plan on which such denial is based; (c) a description, where appropriate, as to how the Claimant can perfect the claim, including a description of any additional material or information necessary to complete the claim and why such material or information is necessary; (d) the appropriate information as to the steps to be taken if the Participant wishes to submit the claim for review; (e) the time limits for requesting a review under Section 9.2 ; and (f) a statement of the Claimant s right to bring a civil action under Section 502(a) of ERISA following an adverse decision on review. 
 (ii) In the case of a complete or partial denial of a Disability benefit claim, the notice shall also provide a statement that the Plan Administrator will provide to the Claimant, upon request and free of charge, a copy of any internal rule, guideline, protocol, or other similar criterion that was relied upon in making the decision. 
 
 9.2 Appeal of Denied Claims . A Claimant whose claim has been completely or partially denied shall be entitled to appeal the claim denial by filing a written appeal with the Plan Administrator within the deadlines described below. A Claimant (or his or her authorized representative) who timely requests a review of the denied claim may review, upon request and free of charge, copies of all documents, records and other information relevant to the denial and may submit written comments, documents, records and other 

 20 

information relevant to the claim to the Plan Administrator. All written comments, documents, records, and other information shall be considered relevant if the information (a) was relied upon in making a benefits determination; (b) was submitted, considered or generated in the course of making a benefits decision regardless of whether it was relied upon to make the decision; or (c) demonstrates compliance with administrative processes and safeguards established for making benefit decisions. The Plan Administrator may, in its sole discretion and if it deems appropriate or necessary, decide to hold a hearing with respect to the claim appeal. 
 (a) In General . Appeal of a denied benefits claim (other than a Disability benefits claim) must be filed in writing with the Plan Administrator no later than 60 days after receipt of the written notification of such claim denial. The Plan Administrator shall make its decision regarding the merits of the denied claim within 60 days following receipt of the appeal (or within 120 days after such receipt in a case where there are special circumstances requiring an extension of time for reviewing the appealed claim). If an extension of time for reviewing the appeal is required, notice of the extension shall be furnished to the Claimant prior to the commencement of the extension. The notice will indicate the special circumstances requiring the extension of time and the date by which the Plan Administrator expects to render the determination on review. The review will take into account comments, documents, records and other information submitted by the Claimant relating to the claim without regard to whether such information was submitted or considered in the initial benefit determination. 
 (b) Disability Benefits . Appeal of a denied Disability benefits claim must be filed in writing with the Plan Administrator no later than 180 days after receipt of the notification of such claim denial. The review shall be conducted by the Plan Administrator (exclusive of the person who made the initial adverse decision or such person s subordinate). In reviewing the appeal, the Plan Administrator shall (1) not afford deference to the initial denial of the claim, (2) consult a medical professional who has appropriate training and experience in the field of medicine relating to the Claimant s disability and who was neither consulted as part of the initial denial nor is the subordinate of such individual, and (3) identify the medical or vocational experts whose advice was obtained with respect to the initial benefit denial, without regard to whether the advice was relied upon in making the decision. The Plan Administrator shall make its decision regarding the merits of the denied claim within 45 days following receipt of the appeal or within 90 days after such receipt, in a case where there are special circumstances requiring an extension of time for reviewing the appealed claim. If an extension of time for reviewing the appeal is required because of special circumstances, written notice of the extension shall be furnished to the Claimant prior to the commencement of the extension. The notice will indicate the special circumstances requiring the extension of time and the date by which the Plan Administrator expects to render the determination on review. Following its review of any additional information submitted by the Claimant, the Plan Administrator shall render a decision on its review of the denied claim. 
 (c) Contents of Notice . If a benefits claim is completely or partially denied on review, notice of such denial shall set forth the reasons for denial in language calculated to be understood by the Participant. 

 21 

(i) The decision on review shall set forth (a) the specific reason or reasons for the denial; (b) specific reference(s) to the relevant provision(s) of this Plan on which the denial is based; (c) a statement that the Claimant is entitled to receive, upon request and free of charge, reasonable access to and copies of all documents, records, or other information relevant (as defined above) to the Claimant s claim; and (d) a statement of the Claimant s right to bring an action under Section 502(a) of ERISA. 
 (ii) For the denial of a Disability benefit, the notice will also include a statement that the Plan Administrator will provide, upon request and free of charge, (a) any internal rule, guideline, protocol or other similar criterion relied upon in making the decision; and (b) any medical opinion relied upon to make the decision. 
 
 9.3 Legal Action . A Claimant may not bring any legal action relating to a claim for benefits under the Plan unless and until the Claimant has followed the claims procedures under the Plan and exhausted his or her administrative remedies under such claims procedures. 
 9.4 Discretion of the Plan Administrator . All interpretations, determinations and decisions of the Plan Administrator with respect to any claim shall be made in its sole discretion, and shall be final and conclusive. 
 
 ARTICLE X Miscellaneous 
 10.1 Protective Provisions . Each Participant and Beneficiary shall cooperate with the Plan Administrator by furnishing any and all information requested by the Plan Administrator in order to facilitate the payment of benefits hereunder. If a Participant or Beneficiary refuses to cooperate with the Plan Administrator, the Company shall have no further obligation to the Participant or Beneficiary under the Plan, other than payment of the then-current balance of the Participant s Accounts in accordance with prior elections and subject to Section 10.12 . 
 10.2 Inability to Locate Participant or Beneficiary . In the event that the Plan Administrator is unable to locate a Participant or Beneficiary within two years following the date the Participant was to commence receiving payment, the entire amount allocated to the Participant s Account shall be forfeited. If, after such forfeiture, the Participant or Beneficiary later claims such benefit, such benefit shall be reinstated without interest or earnings from the date payment was to commence pursuant to ARTICLE VIII . 
 10.3 Designation of Beneficiary . Each Participant may designate in writing a Beneficiary or Beneficiaries (which Beneficiary may be an entity other than a natural person if approved by the Plan Administrator in its sole discretion) to receive any payments that may be made under the Plan following the Participant s death. No Beneficiary designation shall become effective until it is in writing and it is filed with the Plan Administrator. A Beneficiary designation under the Plan may be separate from all other retirement-type plans sponsored by the Company. Such designation may be changed or canceled by the Participant at any time without the consent of any such Beneficiary. Any such designation, change or cancellation must be made in a form 

 22 

approved by the Plan Administrator and shall not be effective until received by the Plan Administrator or its designee. If no Beneficiary has been named, or the designated Beneficiary or Beneficiaries have predeceased the Participant, the Beneficiary shall be the Participant s estate. If a Participant designates more than one Beneficiary, the interests of such Beneficiaries shall be paid in equal shares, unless the Participant has specifically designated otherwise. 
 10.4 No Contract of Employment . Neither the establishment of the Plan, nor any modification thereof, nor the creation of any fund, trust or account, nor the payment of any benefits shall be construed as giving any Participant, or any person whosoever, the right to be retained in the service of the Company, and all Participants and other employees shall remain subject to discharge to the same extent as if the Plan had never been adopted. 
 10.5 No Limitation on Company Actions . Nothing contained in the Plan shall be construed to prevent the Company from taking any action that is deemed by it to be appropriate or in its best interest. No Participant, Beneficiary, or other person shall have any claim against the Company as a result of such action. 
 10.6 Obligations to Company . If a Participant becomes entitled to a payment of benefits under the Plan, and if at such time the Participant has outstanding any debt, obligation, or other liability representing an amount owing to the Company, then the Company may offset such amount owed to it against the amount of benefits otherwise distributable; provided, however, that such deductions cannot exceed 5,000 in the aggregate. Such determination shall be made by the Plan Administrator in its sole discretion. 
 10.7 No Liability for Action or Omission . Neither the Company nor any director, officer or employee of the Company shall be responsible or liable in any manner to any Participant, Beneficiary or any person claiming through them for any benefit or action taken or omitted in connection with the granting of benefits, the continuation of benefits, or the interpretation and administration of this Plan. 
 10.8 Non-Alienation of Benefits . Except as otherwise specifically provided herein, all amounts payable hereunder shall be paid only to the person or persons designated by the Plan and not to any other person or corporation. No part of a Participant s Account shall be liable for the debts, contracts, or engagements of any Participant, or his or her Beneficiary or successors in interest, nor shall such accounts of a Participant be subject to execution by levy, attachment, or garnishment or by any other legal or equitable proceeding, nor shall any such person have any right to alienate, anticipate, commute, pledge, encumber, or assign any benefits or payments hereunder in any manner whatsoever. If any Participant, Beneficiary or successor in interest is adjudicated bankrupt or purports to anticipate, alienate, sell, transfer, assign, pledge, encumber or charge any payment from the Plan, voluntarily or involuntarily, the Plan Administrator, in its discretion, may cancel such payment (or any part thereof) to or for the benefit of such Participant, Beneficiary or successor in interest in such manner as the Plan Administrator shall direct. Notwithstanding the foregoing, all or a portion of a 

 23 

Participant s Account may be awarded to an alternate payee (within the meaning of Section 206(d)(3)(K) of ERISA) if and to the extent so provided in a judgment, decree or order that, in the Plan Administrator s sole discretion, would meet the applicable requirements for qualification as a qualified domestic relations order (within the meaning of Section 206(d)(3)(B)(i) of ERISA) if the Plan were subject to the provisions of Section 206(d) of ERISA. Such amounts shall be payable to the alternate payee in the form of a lump sum distribution and shall be paid within 90 days following the Plan Administrator s determination that the order satisfies the requirements to be a qualified domestic relations order. 
 10.9 Liability for Benefit Payments . The obligation to pay or provide for payment of a benefit hereunder to any Participant or his or her Beneficiary shall, at all times, be the sole and exclusive liability and responsibility of the company that employed the Participant immediately prior to the event giving rise to a payment obligation (the Responsible Company ). No other company or parent, affiliated, Subsidiary or associated company shall be liable or responsible for such payment, and nothing in this Plan shall be construed as creating or imposing any joint or shared liability for any such payment (other than the TEL guarantee set forth in Section 10.10 below). The fact that a company or a parent, affiliated, Subsidiary or associated company other than the Responsible Company actually makes one or more payments to a Participant or his or her Beneficiary shall not be deemed a waiver of this provision; rather, any such payment shall be deemed to have been made on behalf of and for the account of the Responsible Company. 
 10.10 TEL Guarantee . TEL guarantees the payment by the Responsible Company (as defined in Section 10.9 of any benefits provided for or contemplated under this Plan that either (i) the Responsible Company concedes are due and owing to a Participant or Beneficiary or (ii) are finally determined to be due and owing to a Participant or Beneficiary, but that in either case the Responsible Company fails to pay. 
 10.11 Unfunded Status of Plan . The Plan is intended to constitute an unfunded deferred and supplemental retirement compensation plan for Participants, with all benefits payable hereunder constituting an unfunded contractual payment obligation of the Company. Nothing contained in the Plan, and no action taken pursuant to the Plan, shall create or be construed to create a trust of any kind. The Company shall reflect on its books the Participants interests hereunder, but no Participant or any other person shall under any circumstances acquire any property interest in any specific assets of the Company. Nothing contained in this Plan and no action taken pursuant hereto shall create or be construed to create a fiduciary relationship between the Company and any Participant or other person. A Participant s right to receive payments under the Plan shall be no greater than the right of an unsecured general creditor of the Company. Except to the extent that the Company determines that a rabbi trust may be established in connection with the Plan, all payments shall be made from the general funds of the Company, and no special or separate fund shall be established and no segregation of assets shall be made to assure payment. The Company s obligations under this Plan are not assignable or transferable except to (i) any corporation or partnership which acquires all or substantially all of the Company s assets or (ii) any corporation or partnership into 

 24 

which the Company may be merged or consolidated. The provisions of the Plan shall inure to the benefit of each Participant and the Participant s Beneficiaries, heirs, executors, administrators or successors in interest. 
 10.12 Forfeiture for Cause . Notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan, if a Participant s employment is terminated for Cause, or if the Plan Administrator determines that a Participant who has a Separation from Service for any other reason had engaged in conduct prior to his or her Separation from Service that would have constituted Cause, then the Plan Administrator may determine in its sole discretion that such Participant s Account under the Plan shall be forfeited and shall not be payable hereunder. 
 10.13 Recovery of Overpayment . The Plan has a right of reimbursement against any person who receives or holds a payment from the Plan in excess of the amount to which a Participant, spouse, or Beneficiary is entitled under the terms of the Plan. The Plan Administrator may recover the amount overpaid in any manner determined by the Plan Administrator to be in the best interests of the Plan, including, but not limited to, by legal action against the recipient and/or holder of the overpayment or offset against other or future benefits payable to or with respect to the Participant, spouse, or Beneficiary under the Plan. The provisions of this Section are intended to clarify existing rights of the Plan and apply to all past or future overpayments. 
 10.14 Governing Law; Venue . This Plan shall be construed in accordance with and governed by the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania to the extent not superseded by federal law, without reference to the principles of conflict of laws. The courts of competent jurisdiction in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania shall have exclusive jurisdiction for all claims, actions and other proceedings involving or relating to the Plan or any party in interest, including, by way of example and without limitation, a claim or action (i) to recover benefits allegedly due under the Plan or by reason of any law; (ii) to enforce rights under the Plan; (iii) to clarify rights to future benefits under the Plan; or (iv) that seeks a remedy, ruling or judgment of any kind against the Plan or a party in interest. 
 10.15 Severability of Provisions . If any provision of this Plan shall be held invalid or unenforceable, such invalidity or unenforceability shall not affect any other provisions hereof, and this Plan shall be construed and enforced as if such provisions had not been included. 
 10.16 Headings and Captions . The headings and captions herein are provided for reference and convenience only, shall not be considered part of the Plan, and shall not be employed in the construction of the Plan. 
 10.17 Gender, Singular and Plural . All pronouns and any variations thereof shall be deemed to refer to the masculine, feminine, or neuter, as the identity of the person or persons may require. As the context may require, the singular may read as the plural and the plural as the singular. 
 10.18 Notice . Any notice or filing required or permitted to be given to the Plan Administrator under the Plan shall be sufficient if in writing and hand delivered, or sent 

 25 

by registered or certified mail, to TE Connectivity Corporation, Attn: Employee Benefits Administrative Committee, c/o TE Law Department, 1050 Westlakes Drive, Berwyn, PA 19312-2423 or to such other person or entity as the Plan Administrator may designate from time to time. Such notice shall be deemed given as of the date of delivery, or, if delivery is made by mail, as of the date shown on the postmark on the receipt for registration or certification. 
 10.19 Amendment and Termination . The Plan may be amended, suspended, or terminated at any time by the Company in whole or in part in its sole discretion; provided, however, that no such amendment, suspension or termination shall result in any reduction in the value of a Participant s Account determined as of the effective date of such amendment. In addition, the Plan, and/or the terms of any election made hereunder, may be amended at any time and in any respect by the Company or by the Plan Administrator if and to the extent recommended by counsel in order to conform to the requirements of Section 409A of the Code and regulations thereunder or to any other Section of the Code or regulation that bears on the tax-deferred character of the benefits provided hereunder or to maintain the tax-qualified status of the RSIP. In the event of any suspension or termination of the Plan or any portion thereof, payment of affected Participants Accounts shall be made under and in accordance with the terms of the Plan and the applicable elections (except that the Plan Administrator may determine, in its sole discretion, to accelerate payments to all such Participants if and to the extent that such acceleration is permitted under Section 409A of the Code and regulations thereunder). 
 10.20 Delay of Payment for Specified Employees . Notwithstanding any provision of this Plan to the contrary, in the case of any Participant who is a specified employee as of the date of such Participant s Separation from Service within the meaning of Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Code, no Separation Payments under this Plan may be made, or may commence, before the date which is six months after such Participant s Separation from Service Date (or, if earlier, the date of the Participant s death). 
 10.21 Special Rule Regarding Election Changes on or Before December 31, 2008 . To the extent permitted under the provisions of Internal Revenue Service Notice 2005-1, A-19(c) and subsequent related guidance, the Company may, in its sole discretion, permit a Participant to modify an existing election with respect to the timing and form of payment of the Participant s Account hereunder, including, in the Company s discretion, amounts deferred under the Tyco Deferred Compensation Plan that were vested as of December 31, 2004 and would otherwise not be subject to the provisions of this Plan, without regard to the limitations set forth in Section 8.2 , so long as (i) such modification is made on or before December 31, 2008, (ii) such modified election is consistent with the provisions of Sections 8.1 and 10.19 hereof, and (iii) the modified election is made in a year prior to the year in which payment would have been made hereunder but for such election. Participants who are offered such an election for amounts deferred under this Plan (or under a predecessor plan) prior to the Restated Effective Date and who decline to make such an election shall thereafter have that portion of their Account attributable to such deferrals governed by the provisions of this Plan as in effect as of the Restated Effective Date and any previous elections applicable thereto (except to the extent otherwise required in order to comply with Section 409A of the Code).
