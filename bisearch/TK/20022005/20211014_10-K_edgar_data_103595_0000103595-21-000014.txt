PART I 
 (All dollar amounts are in thousands, except per share and per square foot data). 

ITEM I. BUSINESS 
 
 GENERAL 
 
 Village Super Market, Inc. (the Company or Village was founded in 1937. Village operates a chain of twenty-nine ShopRite supermarkets, five Fairway Markets and three Gourmet Garage specialty markets located in New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania and Maryland. 
 
 The Company is a member of Wakefern Food Corporation ("Wakefern"), the nation's largest retailer-owned food cooperative and owner of the ShopRite, Fairway and Gourmet Garage names. This relationship provides Village many of the economies of scale in purchasing, distribution, own branded products, advanced retail technology, marketing and advertising associated with chains of greater size and geographic coverage. The ShopRite Price Plus preferred customer program enables Village to offer continuity programs, focus on target marketing initiatives and to offer discounts and attach digital coupons directly to a customer's Price Plus card. 
 
 During fiscal 2021, sales per store were 52,713 and sales per average square foot of selling space were 1,349. 
 
 Below is a summary of the range of store sizes at July 31, 2021: 
 Total Square Feet Number of Stores Greater than 60,000 16 50,001 to 60,000 9 40,001 to 50,000 5 20,000 to 40,000 4 Less than 20,000 3 Total 37 
 
 These larger store sizes enable the Company s stores to provide a one-stop shopping experience and to feature expanded specialty departments such as an onsite bakery, an expanded delicatessen, a variety of natural and organic foods, ethnic and international foods, prepared foods and pharmacies. Many of our stores emphasize a Power Alley, which features high margin, fresh, convenience offerings in an area within the store that provides quick customer entry and exit for those customers shopping for today's lunch or dinner. 
 
 Online grocery ordering for in-store pick up or home delivery through ShopRite from Home is available in all of our ShopRite stores. Customers can browse our circular, create and edit shopping lists and use ShopRite from Home through shoprite.com or the ShopRite app. Additionally, the ShopRite Order Express app enables customers to pre-order deli, catering, specialty 

occasion cakes and other items. Online ordering for home delivery through third party services is available in all Fairway and Gourmet Garage stores. In April 2020 we also added online ordering for home delivery through third party services in all ShopRite stores. 
 
 The following table shows the percentage of the Company's sales allocated to various product categories during each of the periods indicated: 
 
 Product Categories 2021 2020 Groceries 34.7 35.9 Dairy and Frozen 17.2 17.1 Produce 13.2 11.9 Meats 9.8 9.9 Non-Foods 7.0 7.9 Deli and Prepared Food 7.7 7.4 Pharmacy 3.3 3.8 Seafood 3.2 2.9 Bakery 2.4 2.1 Liquor 1.1 0.7 Other 0.4 0.4 100 100 
 
 A variety of factors affect the profitability of each of the Company's stores, including competition, size, access and parking, lease terms, management supervision, and the strength of the applicable banner in the local community. The Company gives ongoing attention to the d cor and format of its stores and tailors each store's product mix to the preferences of the local community. Village continually evaluates individual stores to determine if they should be closed, remodeled or replaced. 
 
 ACQUISITIONS, DEVELOPMENT AND EXPANSION 
 
 The Company has an ongoing program to upgrade and expand its supermarket chain. This program has included store remodels as well as the opening or acquisition of additional stores. When remodeling, Village has sought, whenever possible, to increase the amount of selling space in its stores. 
 
 We have budgeted 40,000 for capital expenditures in fiscal 2022. Planned expenditures include three major remodels, several smaller store remodels, the purchase of Galloway store shopping center, one new Gourmet Garage store, continued expansion of ShopRite from Home and self-checkout, and various merchandising, technology, equipment and facility upgrades. 
 
 Additional store remodels and sites for new stores are in various stages of development. Village will also consider additional acquisitions should appropriate opportunities arise. 
 
 Fiscal 2021 
 
 Fiscal 2021 capital expenditures include one major remodel, continued expansion of ShopRite from Home and self-checkout, and various merchandising, technology, equipment and facility upgrades. 
 
 On February 22, 2021, Village closed the ShopRite store located in Silver Spring, Maryland. Despite continued investment in marketing and promotional programs, the store was unable to generate sales at a level sufficient to maintain profitability, resulting in its closure. The impacts associated with this closure were not material to the consolidated financial statements. 
 
 Fiscal 2020 
 
 On May 14, 2020, Village completed its acquisition of certain assets, including five supermarkets averaging 52,000 sq. ft. (30,000 selling sq. ft.), a production distribution center (the PDC and the intellectual property of Fairway Group Holdings Corp. and certain of its subsidiaries Fairway ), including the names Fairway and Fairway Markets for 73,622, net of cash acquired. Four of the supermarkets are in Manhattan, specifically the Upper West Side, Upper East Side, Kips Bay and Chelsea locations, and a fifth store is located in Pelham, NY. Like Village, Fairway traces its roots back to a neighborhood 
 2 

market over 80 years ago. Fairway Markets offer a one-stop destination shopping experience with an emphasis on fresh, unique, and high quality offerings paired with an expansive variety of natural, organic, specialty and gourmet products. The PDC is a centralized commissary that promotes production efficiency, product quality and consistency in the bakery, prepared foods, meals to go and other perishable product categories. Production costs at the PDC, including materials, labor and overhead, are included in Cost of sales. The Fairway acquisition expanded our presence in New York City under an iconic city brand and provides Village the ability to expand centralized food production to support stores under all of our banners. 
 
 Fiscal 2020 capital expenditures include costs associated with the opening of an 82,000 sq. ft. (52,000 selling sq. ft.) store in Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania that replaced our existing 53,000 sq. ft. store, expansion of ShopRite from Home, including the opening of an automated micro-fulfillment center in southern New Jersey, one major store remodel, several smaller remodels and equipment upgrades, including those in the integration of the Fairway acquisition. 
 
 WAKEFERN FOOD CORPORATION 
 
 The Company is the second largest member of Wakefern and owns 12.2 of Wakefern s outstanding stock as of July 31, 2021. Wakefern, which was organized in 1946, is the nation s largest retailer-owned food cooperative. Wakefern and its 48 shareholder members operate 362 supermarkets and other retail formats, including 92 stores operated by Wakefern. Only Wakefern and its members are entitled to use the ShopRite, Fairway and Gourmet Garage names and trademarks, and to participate in related advertising and promotional programs. 
 
 The principal benefits to the Company from its relationship with Wakefern are the use of the ShopRite, Fairway and Gourmet Garage names and trademarks, volume purchasing, store and own branded products, distribution and warehousing economies of scale, advertising and promotional programs (including the ShopRite Price Plus card) and the development of advanced retail technology. The Company believes that the ShopRite and Fairway names are widely recognized by its customers and is a factor in their decisions about where to shop. Store and own branded products accounted for approximately 12.4 of ShopRite sales in fiscal 2021. 
 
 Wakefern distributes as a "patronage dividend" to each of its stockholders a share of substantially all of its earnings in proportion to the dollar volume of purchases by the stockholder from Wakefern during each fiscal year. 
 
 While Wakefern has a substantial professional staff, it operates as a member owned cooperative. Executives of most members make contributions of time to the business of Wakefern. Executives of the Company spend a significant amount of their time working on various Wakefern committees, which oversee and direct Wakefern purchasing, merchandising and other programs. In addition, Nicholas Sumas, the Company s Co-President, is a member of the Wakefern Board of Directors. 
 
 Most of the Company's advertising is developed and placed by Wakefern's professional advertising staff. Wakefern is responsible for all broadcast television, radio, print and digital advertisements. Wakefern bills its members using various formulas which allocate advertising costs in accordance with the estimated proportional benefits to each member from such advertising. The Company also places Wakefern developed materials with local newspapers. In addition, Wakefern and its affiliates provide the Company with other services including workers' compensation, liability and property insurance, supplies, certain equipment purchasing, coupon processing, certain financial accounting applications, retail technology support, including shoprite.com, gourmetgarage.com, fairway.com, branded apps and other store services. 
 
 Wakefern operates warehouses and distribution facilities in Elizabeth, Keasbey, Whitehouse, Dayton, Newark and Jamesburg, New Jersey and Gouldsboro, Breinigsville and Hatfield Pennsylvania. The Company and all other members of Wakefern are parties to the Wakefern Stockholders' Agreement which provides for certain commitments by, and restrictions on, all shareholders of Wakefern. This agreement extends until ten years from the date that stockholders representing 75 of Wakefern sales notify Wakefern that those stockholders request the Wakefern Stockholders' Agreement be terminated. Each member is obligated to purchase from Wakefern a minimum of 85 of its requirements for products offered by Wakefern. If this purchase obligation is not met, the member is required to pay Wakefern's profit contribution shortfall attributable to this failure. The Company fulfilled this obligation in fiscal 2021 and 2020. This agreement also requires that in the event of unapproved changes in control of the Company or a sale of the Company or of individual Company stores, except to a qualified successor, the Company in such cases must pay Wakefern an amount equal to the annual profit contribution shortfall attributable to the sale of a store or change in control. No payments are required if the volume lost by a shareholder as a result of the sale of a store is replaced by such shareholder by increased volume in existing or new stores. A "qualified successor" must be, or agree to become, a member of Wakefern, and may not own or operate any supermarkets, other than ShopRite, PriceRite, The Fresh Grocer, Fairway, Gourmet Garage or Dearborn Market supermarkets, in the states of New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Vermont, New Hampshire, 
 3 

Maine or the District of Columbia, or own or operate more than 25 non-ShopRite supermarkets in any other locations in the United States. 
 
 Wakefern, under circumstances specified in its bylaws, may refuse to sell merchandise to, and may repurchase the Wakefern stock of, any member. Such circumstances include a member's bankruptcy filing, certain unapproved transfers by a member of its supermarket business or its capital stock in Wakefern, unapproved acquisition by a member of certain supermarket or grocery wholesale supply businesses, the material breach by a member of any provision of the bylaws of Wakefern or any agreement with Wakefern, or a failure to fulfill financial obligations to Wakefern. 
 
 Any material change in Wakefern's method of operation or a termination or material modification of the Company's relationship with Wakefern following termination of the above agreements, or otherwise, might have an adverse impact on the conduct of the Company's business and could involve additional expense for the Company. The failure of any Wakefern member to fulfill its obligations under these agreements or a member's insolvency or withdrawal from Wakefern could result in increased costs to remaining members. 
 
 Wakefern does not prescribe geographical franchise areas to its members. The specific locations at which the Company, other members of Wakefern, or Wakefern itself, may open new units under the ShopRite, PriceRite, The Fresh Grocer, Fairway, Gourmet Garage or Dearborn Market names are, however, subject to the approval of Wakefern's Site Development Committee. This committee is composed of persons who are not employees or members of Wakefern. Committee decisions to deny a site application may be appealed to the Wakefern Board of Directors. Wakefern assists its members in their site selection by providing appropriate demographic data, volume projections and estimates of the impact of the proposed store on existing member supermarkets in the area. 
 
 Each of Wakefern's members is required to make capital contributions to Wakefern based on the number of stores operated by that member and the purchases from Wakefern generated by those stores. As additional stores are opened or acquired by a member, additional capital must be contributed by it to Wakefern. The Company s investment in Wakefern and affiliates was 33,004 at July 31, 2021. The total amount of debt outstanding from all capital pledges to Wakefern is 3,423 at July 31, 2021. The maximum per store investment increased from 950 to 975 in fiscal 2021, resulting in an additional 670 capital pledge, which was paid in fiscal 2021. 
 
 As required by the Wakefern bylaws, the Company s investment in Wakefern is pledged to Wakefern to secure the Company s obligations to Wakefern. In addition, five members of the Sumas family have guaranteed the Company s obligations to Wakefern. These personal guarantees are required of any 5 shareholder of the Company who is active in the operation of the Company. Wakefern does not own any securities of the Company or its subsidiaries. The Company s investment in Wakefern entitles the Company to enough votes to elect one member to the Wakefern Board of Directors due to cumulative voting rights. 
 
 LABOR 
 
 As of July 31, 2021, the Company employed approximately 7,268 persons with approximately 70 working part-time. Approximately 89 of the Company s employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements. Contracts with the Company s seven unions have expiration dates between March 2020 and August 2025. Approximately 10 of our associates are represented by unions whose contracts have expired or will expire within one year. Many of the Company s competitors are similarly unionized. 
 
 SEASONALITY 
 
 The majority of our revenues are generally not seasonal in nature. However, revenues tend to be higher during the major holidays throughout the year. 
 
 REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT 
 
 The Company s business requires various licenses and the registration of facilities with state and federal health and drug regulatory agencies. These licenses and registration requirements obligate the Company to observe certain rules and regulations, and a violation of these rules and regulations could result in a suspension or revocation of licenses or registrations and fines or penalties. In addition, most licenses require periodic renewals. The Company has not experienced material difficulties with respect to obtaining or retaining licenses and registrations.

COMPETITION 
 
 The supermarket business is highly competitive and characterized by narrow profit margins. Village competes directly with multiple retail formats both in-store and online, including national, regional and local supermarket chains as well as warehouse clubs, supercenters, drug stores, discount general merchandise stores, fast food chains, restaurants, dollar stores and convenience stores. Some of the Company's principal competitors include Acme, Aldi, Amazon/Whole Foods, BJs, Costco, Foodtown, Giant, Kings, Lidl, Safeway, Stop Shop, Target, Trader Joe's, Wal-Mart, Wegmans and Weis. Competition with these outlets is based on price, store location, convenience, promotion, product assortment, quality and service. Some of these competitors have greater financial resources, lower merchandise acquisition costs and lower operating expenses than we do. 
 
 AVAILABLE INFORMATION 
 
 As a member of the Wakefern cooperative, Village relies upon our customer focused websites, shoprite.com, gourmetgarage.com and fairway.com, for interaction with customers and prospective employees. This website is maintained by Wakefern for the benefit of all ShopRite supermarkets, and therefore does not contain any financial information related to the Company. 
 
 The Company will provide paper copies of the annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and press releases free of charge upon request to any shareholder. In addition, electronic copies of these filings can be obtained at sec.gov.

ITEM 2. PROPERTIES 
 
 As of July 31, 2021, Village owns the sites of six of its supermarkets (containing 412,000 square feet of total space), all of which are freestanding stores, except the Egg Harbor store, which is part of a shopping center, and the micro-fulfillment center in southern New Jersey. The remaining 31 stores (containing 1,614,000 square feet of total space), PDC and the corporate headquarters are leased, with initial lease terms generally ranging from 20 to 30 years, usually with renewal options. Twenty-three of these leased stores are located in shopping centers or city storefronts and the remaining eight are freestanding stores. Most of the Company s leases contain renewal options at increased rents of five years each at the Company s sole discretion. These options enable Village to retain the use of facilities in desirable operating areas. Each renewal option is evaluated when recognizing the lease right-of-use assets and liabilities, and the Company utilizes the lease term for which it is reasonably certain to use the underlying asset. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet. The Company is obligated under all leases to pay for real estate taxes, utilities and liability insurance, and under certain leases to pay additional amounts based on maintenance and a percentage of sales in excess of stipulated amounts. The Company accounts for rent holidays, escalating rent provisions, and construction allowances on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. 
 
 As of July 31, 2021, finance lease right-of-use assets of 12,806 are included in property, equipment and fixtures, net in the Company's consolidated balance sheet. 
 
 The annual rental payment, including finance leases, for all of the Company's leased facilities for the year ended July 31, 2021 was approximately 37,457. For additional information on lease obligations, see Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements. 
 
 Village is a limited partner in two partnerships, one of which owns a shopping center in which one of our leased stores is located. The Company is also a general partner in a partnership that is a lessor of one of the Company's freestanding stores. 
 
 On October 13, 2021, Village completed the acquisition of the Galloway store shopping center for 9,800. As of July 31, 2021, the right-of-use asset and obligation related to the Galloway store's lease were 873 and 887, respectively.

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
 
 Superstorm Sandy devastated Village's trade area on October 29, 2012 and resulted in the closure of almost all of our stores for periods of time ranging from a few hours to eight days. Village disposed of substantial amounts of perishable product and also incurred repair, labor and other costs as a result of the storm. Wakefern, as the policy holder, has pursued recovery of uncollected insurance claims on behalf of all Wakefern members through litigation against the insurance carrier and others since October 2013. Litigation over this matter has ended and the Company received an additional in the 4th quarter of fiscal 2020 which was recognized as a reduction in operating and administrative expense. Village has received a total of related to losses incurred as a result of Superstorm Sandy. 
 
 The Company is involved in other litigation incidental to the normal course of business. Company management is of the opinion that the ultimate resolution of these legal proceedings should not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position, results of operations or liquidity of the Company.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 
 (Dollars in thousands, except per share and per square foot data). 
 
 OVERVIEW 
 
 Village operates a chain of twenty-nine ShopRite supermarkets, five Fairway Markets and three Gourmet Garage specialty markets located in New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania and Maryland. Village is the second largest member of Wakefern Food Corporation Wakefern ), the nation s largest retailer-owned food cooperative and owner of the ShopRite, Fairway and Gourmet Garage names. This ownership interest in Wakefern provides Village with many of the economies of scale in purchasing, distribution, advanced retail technology, marketing and advertising associated with larger chains. 
 
 On February 22, 2021, Village closed the ShopRite store located in Silver Spring, Maryland. Despite continued investment in marketing and promotional programs, the store was unable to generate sales at a level sufficient to maintain profitability, resulting in its closure. The impacts associated with this closure were not material to the consolidated financial statements. 
 
 On May 14, 2020, Village completed its acquisition of certain assets, including five supermarkets averaging 52,000 sq. ft. (30,000 selling sq. ft.), a production distribution center (the PDC and the intellectual property of Fairway Group Holdings Corp. and certain of its subsidiaries Fairway ), including the names Fairway and Fairway Markets for 73,622, net of cash acquired. Four of the supermarkets are in Manhattan, specifically the Upper West Side, Upper East Side, Kips Bay and Chelsea locations, and a fifth store is located in Pelham, NY. Like Village, Fairway traces its roots back to a neighborhood market over 80 years ago. Fairway Markets offer a one-stop destination shopping experience with an emphasis on fresh, unique, and high quality offerings paired with an expansive variety of natural, organic, specialty and gourmet products. The PDC is a centralized commissary that promotes production efficiency, product quality and consistency in the bakery, prepared foods, meals to go and other perishable product categories. Production costs at the PDC, including materials, labor and overhead, are included in Cost of sales. The Fairway acquisition expands our presence in New York City under an iconic city brand and provides Village the ability to expand centralized food production to support stores under all of our banners. 
 
 On November 1, 2019, Village opened an 82,000 sq. ft. (52,000 selling sq. ft.) ShopRite in Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania and replaced our existing 53,000 sq. ft. store. 
 
 The supermarket industry is highly competitive and characterized by narrow profit margins. The Company competes directly with multiple retail formats, both in-store and online, including national, regional and local supermarket chains as well as warehouse clubs, supercenters, drug stores, discount general merchandise stores, fast food chains, restaurants, dollar stores and convenience stores. Village competes by using low pricing, providing a superior customer service experience and a broad range of consistently available quality products, including our own brands portfolio. The ShopRite Price Plus preferred customer program enables Village to offer continuity programs, focus on target marketing initiatives and to offer discounts and attach digital coupons directly to a customer's Price Plus card. 
 
 The Company s stores, six of which are owned, average 55,000 total square feet. These larger store sizes enable the Company s stores to provide a one-stop shopping experience and to feature expanded higher margin specialty departments such as an on-site bakery, an expanded delicatessen, a variety of natural and organic foods, ethnic and international foods, prepared foods and pharmacies. Many of our stores emphasize a Power Alley, which features high margin, fresh, convenience offerings in an area within the store that provides quick customer entry and exit for those customers shopping for today's lunch or dinner. Certain of our stores include the Village Food Garden concept featuring a restaurant style kitchen, and several kiosks offering a wide variety of store prepared specialty foods for both take-home and in-store dining. 
 
 Online grocery ordering for in-store pick up or home delivery through ShopRite from Home is available in all of our ShopRite stores. Customers can browse our circular, create and edit shopping lists and use ShopRite from Home through shoprite.com or the ShopRite app. Additionally, the ShopRite Order Express app enables customers to pre-order deli, catering, specialty occasion cakes and other items. Online ordering for home delivery through third party services is available in all Fairway and Gourmet Garage stores. In April 2020 we also added online ordering for home delivery through third party services in all ShopRite stores. 
 
 We consider a variety of indicators to evaluate our performance, such as same store sales; percentage of total sales by department (mix); shrink; departmental gross profit percentage; sales per labor hour; units per labor hour; and hourly labor rates. 
 
 10 

The Company utilizes a 52 - 53 week fiscal year, ending on the last Saturday in the month of July. Fiscal 2021 contains 53 weeks and fiscal 2020 contains 52 weeks. 
 
 COVID-19 
 
 The Company was significantly impacted by the COVID-19 outbreak as it operates in and around one of the early U.S. epicenters of the health crisis. The Company is classified as an essential business and has remained open to serve our customers and the communities in which we operate. We continue to experience changes in customer shopping habits, shifts in product mix and increased demand through digital channels as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Demand remains high in most stores, however sales at Fairway and Gourmet Garage locations in Manhattan have been negatively impacted by localized residential population migration out of the city and less commuter and tourist traffic. We expect continued uncertainty in our business as well as the local and regional economies in which we operate depending on the duration and intensity of the COVID-19 pandemic (see the "Outlook" section below for further discussion of risks and uncertainties). 
 
 NON-GAAP MEASURES 
 The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements, including the related notes, are presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles GAAP ). We provide non-GAAP measures, including Adjusted net income and Adjusted operating and administrative expenses management believes these metrics are useful to investors and analysts. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as an alternative to GAAP measures such as net income, operating income, operating and administrative expense or any other GAAP measure of performance. These measures should not be reviewed in isolation or considered as a substitute for our financial results as reported in accordance with GAAP. We believe Adjusted net income and Adjusted operating and administrative expense are useful metrics to investors and analysts because they present more accurate year-over-year comparisons of our net income and operating and administrative expense. Other companies may have different definitions of Non-GAAP Measures and provide for different adjustments, and comparability to the Company's results of operations may be impacted by such differences. The Company's presentation of Non-GAAP Measures should not be construed as an implication that its future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 
 The following table sets forth the components of the consolidated statements of operations of the Company as a percentage of sales: 
 
 July 31, 2021 July 25, 2020 Sales 100.00 100.00 Cost of sales 72.17 71.93 Gross profit 27.83 28.07 Operating and administrative expense 24.57 24.65 Depreciation and amortization 1.69 1.74 Impairment of assets 0.14 Operating income 1.43 1.68 Interest expense (0.19) (0.14) Interest income 0.18 0.22 Income before income taxes 1.42 1.76 Income taxes 0.44 0.38 Net income 0.98 1.38 
 
 SALES 
 
 Sales were 2,030,330 in fiscal 2021, an increase of 225,736, or 12.5 from fiscal 2020. Sales increased 35,433, or 2.0 , due to fiscal 2021 containing 53 weeks. Excluding the impact of the 53rd week, sales increased due to the Fairway acquisition completed on May 14, 2020, the opening of the Stroudsburg replacement store on November 1, 2019 and a same store sales increase of 1.8 . Excluding the impact of the 53rd week, same store sales increased 7.5 in fiscal 2021 on a two-year stacked basis compared to fiscal 2019. 
 
 Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have experienced higher average basket sizes and decreased transaction counts as customers have consolidated shopping trips. Additionally, both food inflation and increased Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program ("SNAP") benefits positively impacted sales. Same store digital sales growth accelerated through both ShopRite from Home and partnerships with online grocery picking and delivery services, increasing 68 in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 and 219 on a two-year stacked basis. During the COVID-19 pandemic, fiscal 2021 sales at Fairway and Gourmet Garage locations in Manhattan have been significantly negatively impacted due primarily to residential population migration out of the city and less commuter and tourist traffic. 
 
 New stores and replacement stores are included in same store sales in the quarter after the store has been in operation for four full quarters. Store renovations and expansions are included in same store sales immediately. 
 
 GROSS PROFIT 
 
 Gross profit as a percentage of sales decreased to 27.83 in fiscal 2021 compared to 28.07 in fiscal 2020. Higher margins associated with Fairway increased gross profit (.22 ), despite higher costs as we transition and integrate commissary operations into our business. Excluding the impact of Fairway, gross profit as a percentage of sales decreased .46 due primarily to decreased departmental gross margin percentages (.48 and increased warehouse assessment charges from Wakefern (.34 ), partially offset by a favorable change in product mix (0.17 ), lower promotional spending (0.16 and increased patronage dividends and rebates received from Wakefern (.03 ). Departmental gross profits decreased due partly to price investments. 
 
 OPERATING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE 
 
 Operating and administrative expense as a percentage of sales decreased to 24.57 in fiscal 2021 compared to 24.65 in fiscal 2020. Adjusted operating and administrative expense as a percentage of sales increased to 24.76 in fiscal 2021 compared to 24.63 in fiscal 2020. 
 
 13 

Adjusted operating and administrative expense increased due primarily to increased occupancy costs due primarily to the Fairway acquisition (.56 and increased external fees and transportation costs associated with digital sales (.42 ), partially offset by decreased costs related to COVID-19, including enhanced wages and benefits, security and outside sanitation services (.62 and lower payroll and fringe benefit costs (.24 ). Payroll and fringe benefits decreased primarily due to leverage from higher sales, reductions in service department offerings, labor shortages and productivity initiatives partially offset by the addition of Fairway, growth of ShopRite from Home and minimum wage and demand driven pay rate increases. 
 
 DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION 
 
 Depreciation and amortization expense was 34,195 and 31,358 in fiscal 2021 and 2020, respectively. Depreciation and amortization expense increased in fiscal 2021 compared to the prior year due to depreciation related to assets acquired as part of the Fairway acquisition. 
 
 IMPAIRMENT OF ASSETS 
 
 Impairment of assets includes non-cash charges related to the Fairway trade name of 2,386 (see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements) and the long-lived assets for one Gourmet Garage store of 514. 
 
 INTEREST EXPENSE 
 
 Interest expense was 3,943 and 2,611 in fiscal 2021 and 2020, respectively. Interest expense increased in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 due primarily to interest expense related to the credit agreement entered into on May 6, 2020 (see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements). 
 
 INTEREST INCOME 
 
 Interest income was 3,633 and 4,060 in fiscal 2021 and 2020, respectively. Interest income decreased in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 due primarily to lower interest rates for amounts invested in variable rate notes receivable from Wakefern and demand deposits invested at Wakefern. 
 
 INCOME TAXES 
 
 The Company s effective income tax rate was 30.7 and 21.4 in fiscal 2021 and 2020, respectively. 
 
 Fiscal 2020 includes a 2,512 benefit from a federal net operating loss carryback at a rate higher than the current statutory tax rate. Excluding the impact of these adjustments, the effective income tax rate was 29.3 in fiscal 2020. The increase in the effective tax rate in fiscal 2021 is due primarily to favorable return to provision adjustments in fiscal 2020 and increased state taxable income in higher tax rate jurisdictions. 
 
 NET INCOME 
 
 Net income was 19,994 in fiscal 2021 compared to 24,939 in fiscal 2020. Adjusted net income was 18,914 in fiscal 2021 compared to 23,087 in fiscal 2020. Adjusted net income decreased 18 in fiscal 2021 compared to the prior year due primarily to lower sales volumes in Manhattan and higher costs as we transition and integrate commissary operations into our business.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
 
 Critical accounting policies are those accounting policies that management believes are important to the portrayal of the Company s financial condition and results of operations. These policies require management s most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. 
 
 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
 
 IMPAIRMENT 
 
 The Company reviews the carrying values of its long-lived assets, such as property, equipment and fixtures for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of assets may not be recoverable. Such review analyzes the undiscounted estimated future net cash flows from asset groups at the store level to determine if the carrying value of such assets are recoverable from their respective cash flows. If impairment is indicated, it is measured by comparing the fair value of the long-lived asset groups to their carrying value. 
 
 Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested at the end of each fiscal year, or more frequently if circumstances dictate, for impairment. The Company utilizes valuation techniques, such as earnings multiples, in addition to the Company s market capitalization, to assess goodwill for impairment. Calculating the fair value of a reporting unit requires the use of estimates. Management believes the fair value of Village s one reporting unit exceeds its carrying value at July 31, 2021. Should the Company s carrying value of its one reporting unit exceed its fair value, the amount of any resulting goodwill impairment may be material to the Company s financial position and results of operations. The fair value of indefinite-lived intangible assets are estimated based on the discounted cash flow model using the relief from royalty method. 
 
 Manhattan store sales have been impacted by localized residential population migration out of Manhattan and less commuter and tourist traffic during the COVID-19 pandemic. Due to uncertainty regarding the duration and extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Manhattan, the Company recognized an impairment charge related to the Fairway trade name of 2,386 for year ended July 31, 2021. 
 
 PATRONAGE DIVIDENDS 
 
 As a stockholder of Wakefern, Village earns a share of Wakefern s earnings, which are distributed as a patronage dividend. This dividend is based on a distribution of substantially all of Wakefern s operating profits for its fiscal year (which ends on or about September 30) in proportion to the dollar volume of purchases by each member from Wakefern during that fiscal year. Patronage dividends are recorded as a reduction of cost of sales as merchandise is sold. Village accrues estimated patronage dividends due from Wakefern quarterly based on an estimate of the annual Wakefern patronage dividend and an estimate of Village s share of this annual dividend based on Village s estimated proportional share of the dollar volume of business transacted with Wakefern that year. The patronage dividend receivable based on these estimates was 11,860 and 11,204 at July 31, 2021 and July 25, 2020, respectively. 
 
 BUSINESS COMBINATIONS 
 
 We account for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires that once control is obtained, all the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at their respective fair values at the date of acquisition. The determination of fair values of identifiable assets and liabilities requires estimates and the use of valuation techniques when market value is not readily available. For intangible assets acquired in a business combination, we typically determine the fair value based on the discounted cash flow model, specifically the relief from royalty method for intangible assets related to a trade name. Significant estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include, but are not limited to, the amount and timing of future revenues, cash flows, growth rates, discount rates and useful lives. The excess of the purchase price over fair values of identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. 

15 

PENSION PLANS 
 
 The determination of the Company s obligation and expense for Company-sponsored pension plans is dependent, in part, on Village s selection of assumptions used by actuaries in calculating those amounts. These assumptions are described in Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements and include, among others, the discount rate, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and the rate of increase in compensation costs. Actual results that differ from the Company s assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and, therefore, generally affect recognized expense in future periods. While management believes that its assumptions are appropriate, significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in the Company s assumptions may materially affect cash flows, pension obligations and future expense. 
 
 The objective of the discount rate assumption is to reflect the rate at which the Company s pension obligations could be effectively settled based on the expected timing and amounts of benefits payable to participants under the plans. Our methodology for selecting the discount rate as of July 31, 2021 was to match the plans' cash flows to that of a yield curve on high-quality fixed-income investments. Based on this method, we utilized a weighted-average discount rate of 2.44 at July 31, 2021 compared to 2.26 at July 25, 2020. Changes in the discount rate and updated assumptions on mortality tables and improvement scales resulted in a net decrease in the projected benefit obligation by approximately (1,206) at July 31, 2021. Village evaluated the expected increase in compensation costs of 4.50 and concluded no changes in this assumption was necessary in estimating pension plan obligations and expense. The Company utilizes a liability-driven investment ("LDI") strategy. A LDI strategy focuses on maintaining a close to fully-funded status over the long-term with minimal funded status risk. This is achieved by investing more of the plan assets in fixed income instruments to more closely match the duration of the plan liability. The investment allocation to fixed income instruments will increase as each plans' funded status increases. Based on the Company s LDI strategy, the Company assumed a weighted-average assumed long-term rate of return on plan assets of 3.36 in fiscal 2021. 
 
 Sensitivity to changes in the major assumptions used in the calculation of the Company s pension plans is as follows: 
 
 Percentage point change Projected benefit obligation decrease (increase) Expense decrease (increase) Discount rate + / - 1.0 9,693 (12,211) 376 (436) Expected return on assets + / - 1.0 589 (589) 
 
 Village made no contributions in both fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020 to these Company-sponsored pension plans. In fiscal 2020 the Company began the process of terminating the Village Super Market, Inc. Employees Retirement Plan. Upon satisfaction of all regulatory requirements, which is expected to occur during fiscal 2022, the Company will fully fund and liquidate all plan assets to purchase annuity contracts from an insurance company for all participants who do not elect a lump sum distribution. At the time of settlement, the Company will recognize a non-cash pre-tax charge representing the plan s remaining unrecognized losses within accumulated other comprehensive loss as of the termination date. As of July 31, 2021, the funded status of this plan is a net liability of 3,844 and the pre-tax amount included in Accumulated other comprehensive loss is 15,155. Contributions to the remaining plans are expected to be immaterial in fiscal 2022.

The change in cash flows from operating activities in fiscal 2021 was primarily due to changes in working capital and net income adjusted for non-cash items including depreciation and amortization, share-based compensation, deferred taxes, loss on pension settlements, the provision to value inventories at LIFO and the gain on sale of prescription lists and property, equipment and fixtures. 
 
 16 

Working capital changes, including other assets and other liabilities, decreased net cash provided by operating activities by 1,587 in fiscal 2021 compared an increase in net cash provided by operating activities of 1,127 in fiscal 2020. This change in impact of working capital is due primarily to lower accounts payable to Wakefern and Accounts payable and accrued expense due to inventory turnover and operations normalizing after the initial impact of the pandemic partially offset by changes in timing of income tax payments. 
 
 During fiscal 2021, Village used cash to fund capital expenditures of 25,233, dividends of 13,050, principal payments of long-term debt of 8,414 and additional investments of 2,287 in notes receivable from Wakefern, net of proceeds received on matured notes. Capital expenditures include one major remodel, continued expansion of ShopRite from Home and self-checkout, and various merchandising, technology, equipment and facility upgrades. 
 
 During fiscal 2020, Village used cash to fund capital expenditures of 54,495, dividends of 12,965, treasury stock purchases of 4,389 and additional investments of 2,800 in notes receivable from Wakefern, net of proceeds received on matured notes. The 73,622 purchase price for the Fairway acquisition was funded by 50,000 drawn on the Company s unsecured revolving line of credit and a 25,500 unsecured term loan pursuant to the Company's Credit Facility. Capital expenditures include costs associated with the opening of an 82,000 sq. ft. (52,000 selling sq. ft.) store in Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania that replaced our existing 53,000 sq. ft. store, expansion of ShopRite from Home, including the opening of an automated micro-fulfillment center in southern New Jersey, one major store remodel, several smaller remodels and equipment upgrades, including those in the integration of the Fairway acquisition. 
 
 LIQUIDITY and DEBT 
 
 Working capital was 44,023 and 34,522 at July 31, 2021 and July 25, 2020, respectively. Working capital ratios at the same dates were 1.29 and 1.21 to one, respectively. The Company s working capital needs are reduced, since inventories are generally sold by the time payments to Wakefern and other suppliers are due. 
 
 We have budgeted 40,000 for capital expenditures in fiscal 2022. Planned expenditures include three major remodels, several smaller store remodels, the purchase of the Galloway store shopping center, one new Gourmet Garage store, continued expansion of ShopRite from Home and self-checkout, and various merchandising, technology, equipment and facility upgrades. The Company s primary sources of liquidity in fiscal 2022 are expected to be cash and cash equivalents on hand at July 31, 2021 and operating cash flow generated in fiscal 2022. 
 
 At July 31, 2021, the Company held variable rate notes receivable due from Wakefern of 27,325 that earn interest at the prime rate plus 1.25 and mature on August 15, 2022 and 27,970 that earn interest at the prime rate plus .75 and mature on February 15, 2024. Wakefern has the right to prepay these notes at any time. Under certain conditions, the Company can require Wakefern to prepay the notes, although interest earned since inception would be reduced as if it was earned based on overnight money market rates as paid by Wakefern on demand deposits. 
 
 At July 31, 2021, Village had demand deposits invested at Wakefern in the amount of 86,670. These deposits earn overnight money market rates. 
 
 On May 6, 2020, Village entered into a credit agreement (the Credit Facility with Wells Fargo National Bank, National Association Wells Fargo that supersedes in its entirety the prior credit agreement with Wells Fargo dated November 9, 2017. The principal purpose of the Credit Facility is to finance general corporate and working capital requirements and Village s acquisition of certain Fairway assets. Among other things, the Credit Facility provides for a maximum loan amount of 150,500 as further set forth below: 
 
 An unsecured revolving line of credit providing a maximum amount available for borrowing of 125,000. Indebtedness under this agreement bears interest at the applicable LIBOR rate plus 1.10 and expires on May 6, 2025. 
 
 An unsecured term loan with a maximum loan amount of 25,500. On May 12, 2020, Village executed a 25,500 term note, repayable in equal monthly installments based on a seven-year amortization schedule through May 4, 2027 and bearing interest at the applicable LIBOR rate plus 1.35 . Additionally, Village executed an interest rate swap for a notional amount equal to the term loan amount that fixes the base LIBOR rate at .41 per annum through May 4, 2027, resulting in a fixed effective interest rate of 1.76 on the term note. 
 
 On September 1, 2020, Village converted 50,000 of its revolving line of credit to a secured converted term loan. The conversion reduced the maximum amount available for borrowing under the revolving line of credit from 125,000 to 75,000. The term loan bears interest at the applicable LIBOR rate plus 1.50 and is repayable in equal monthly 
 17 

installments based on a fifteen-year amortization schedule beginning on the conversion date. Additionally, Village previously executed a forward interest rate swap, effective on the conversion date, for a notional amount equal to the term loan amount that fixes the base LIBOR rate at 0.69 per annum for 15 years, resulting in a fixed effective interest rate of 2.19 on the converted term loan. The term loan is secured by real properties of Village Super Market, Inc. and its subsidiaries, including the sites of three Village stores. 
 
 The Credit Facility also provides for up to 25,000 of letters of credit 7,336 outstanding at July 31, 2021), which secure obligations for store leases and construction performance guarantees to municipalities. The Credit Facility contains covenants that, among other conditions, require a minimum tangible net worth, a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio and a maximum adjusted debt to EBITDAR ratio. The Company was in compliance with all covenants of the credit agreement at July 31, 2021. As of July 31, 2021, 67,664 remained available under the unsecured revolving line of credit. 
 
 During fiscal 2021, Village paid cash dividends of 13,050. Dividends in fiscal 2021 consist of 1.00 per Class A common share and .65 per Class B common share. 
 
 During fiscal 2020, Village paid cash dividends of 12,965. Dividends in fiscal 2020 consist of 1.00 per Class A common share and .65 per Class B common share. 
 
 OUTLOOK 
 
 This annual report contains certain forward-looking statements about Village s future performance. These statements are based on management s assumptions and beliefs in light of information currently available. Such statements relate to, for example: economic conditions; uninsured losses; expected pension plan contributions; projected capital expenditures; expected dividend payments; cash flow requirements; inflation expectations; public health conditions; and legal matters; and are indicated by words such as will, expect, should, intend, anticipates, believes and similar words or phrases. The Company cautions the reader that there is no assurance that actual results or business conditions will not differ materially from the results expressed, suggested or implied by such forward-looking statements. The Company undertakes no obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect developments or information obtained after the date hereof. 
 
 Due to continued uncertainties in the extent and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on our business, we will not provide same store sales guidance for fiscal 2022. 
 We have budgeted 40,000 for capital expenditures in fiscal 2022. Planned expenditures include three major remodels, several smaller store remodels, the purchase of the Galloway store shopping center, one new Gourmet Garage store, continued expansion of ShopRite from Home and self-checkout, and various merchandising, technology, equipment and facility upgrades. 
 The Board s current intention is to continue to pay quarterly dividends in 2022 at the most recent rate of .25 per Class A and .1625 per Class B share. 
 We believe cash and cash equivalents on hand, operating cash flow and the Company's Credit Facility will be adequate to meet anticipated requirements for working capital, capital expenditures and debt payments for the foreseeable future. 
 We expect our effective income tax rate in fiscal 2022 to be in the range of 30.5 - 31.5 . 
 We expect approximately 15,891 of net periodic pension costs in fiscal 2022 related to the three Company sponsored defined benefit pension plans, including a 15,155 non-cash, pre-tax settlement charge representing the remaining unrecognized losses within accumulated other comprehensive loss related to a plan termination expected to occur during fiscal 2022. The Company will fully fund this plan and liquidate all plan assets to purchase annuity contracts from an insurance company for all participants who do not elect a lump sum distribution. As of July 31, 2021, the funded status of this plan is a net liability of 3,844. Contributions to the remaining plans are expected to be immaterial in fiscal 2022. 
 18 

Various uncertainties and other factors could cause actual results to differ from the forward-looking statements contained in this report. These include: 
 
 The Company operates in and around one of the epicenters of the initial COVID-19 health crisis in the United States with much of our trade area under stay-at-home orders from mid-March 2020 through June 2020. The Company is classified as an essential business and has remained open to serve our customers and the communities in which we operate. The continuing impact on our business, including the length and impact of stay-at-home orders and/or regional quarantines, labor shortages and employment trends, disruptions to supply chains, higher operating costs, the form and impact of economic stimulus and general overall economic instability, is uncertain at this time and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Furthermore, the impact of the COVID-19 health crisis may exacerbate other risks and uncertainties included herein, which could have a material effect on the Company. 
 The Fairway acquisition involves a number of risks, uncertainties and challenges, including under-performance relative to our expectations, additional capital requirements, unforeseen expenses or delays, imprecise assumptions or our inability to achieve projected cost savings or other synergies, competitive factors in the marketplace and difficulties integrating the business, including merging company cultures, cultivating brand strategy, expansion of food production and conforming the acquired company's technology, standards, processes, procedures and controls. Sales and operating profits have underperformed compared to projected amounts due primarily to population migration out of Manhattan and less commuter and tourist traffic during the COVID-19 pandemic. Many of these potential circumstances are outside of our control and any of them could result in an adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows and the diversion of management time and resources. 
 The supermarket business is highly competitive and characterized by narrow profit margins. Results of operations may be materially adversely impacted by competitive pricing and promotional programs, industry consolidation and competitor store openings. Village competes directly with multiple retail formats both in-store and online, including national, regional and local supermarket chains as well as warehouse clubs, supercenters, drug stores, discount general merchandise stores, fast food chains, restaurants, dollar stores and convenience stores. Some of these competitors have greater financial resources, lower merchandise acquisition costs and lower operating expenses than we do. 
 The Company s stores are concentrated in New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania and Maryland. We are vulnerable to economic downturns in these states in addition to those that may affect the country as a whole. Economic conditions such as inflation, deflation, interest rate fluctuations, movements in energy costs, social programs, minimum wage legislation, unemployment rates, disturbances due to social unrest and changing demographics may adversely affect our sales and profits. 
 Village purchases substantially all of its merchandise from Wakefern. In addition, Wakefern provides the Company with support services in numerous areas including advertising, workers' compensation, liability and property insurance, supplies, certain equipment purchasing, coupon processing, certain financial accounting applications, retail technology support, and other store services. Further, Village receives patronage dividends and other product incentives from Wakefern and also has demand deposits and notes receivable due from Wakefern. 
 
 Any material change in Wakefern s method of operation or a termination or material modification of Village s relationship with Wakefern could have an adverse impact on the conduct of the Company s business and could involve additional expense for Village. The failure of any Wakefern member to fulfill its obligations to Wakefern or a member s insolvency or withdrawal from Wakefern could result in increased costs to the Company. Additionally, an adverse change in Wakefern s results of operations could have an adverse effect on Village s results of operations. 
 Approximately 89 of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements. Any work stoppages could have an adverse impact on our financial results. If we are unable to control health care and pension costs provided for in the collective bargaining agreements, we may experience increased operating costs. 
 The Company could be adversely affected if consumers lose confidence in the safety and quality of the food supply chain. The real or perceived sale of contaminated food products by us could result in a loss of consumer confidence and product liability claims, which could have a material adverse effect on our sales and operations. 
 19 

Certain of the multi-employer plans to which we contribute are underfunded. As a result, we expect that contributions to these plans may increase. Additionally, the benefit levels and related items will be issues in the negotiation of our collective bargaining agreements. Under current law, an employer that withdraws or partially withdraws from a multi-employer pension plan may incur a withdrawal liability to the plan, which represents the portion of the plan s underfunding that is allocable to the withdrawing employer under very complex actuarial and allocation rules. The failure of a withdrawing employer to fund these obligations can impact remaining employers. The amount of any increase or decrease in our required contributions to these multi-employer pension plans will depend upon the outcome of collective bargaining, actions taken by trustees who manage the plans, government regulations, withdrawals by other participating employers and the actual return on assets held in the plans, among other factors. 
 The Company uses a combination of insurance and self-insurance to provide for potential liability for workers compensation, automobile, general liability, property, director and officers liability, and certain employee health care benefits. Any projection of losses is subject to a high degree of variability. Changes in legal claims, trends and interpretations, variability in inflation rates, changes in the nature and method of claims settlement, benefit level changes due to changes in applicable laws, and insolvency of insurance carriers could all affect our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. 
 Our long-lived assets, primarily store property, equipment and fixtures, are subject to periodic testing for impairment. Failure of our asset groups to achieve sufficient levels of cash flow could result in impairment charges on long-lived assets. 
 Our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested at the end of each fiscal year, or more frequently if circumstances dictate, for impairment. Failure of acquired businesses to achieve their forecasted expectations could result in impairment charges to goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets. 
 Our effective tax rate may be impacted by the results of tax examinations and changes in tax laws. 
 Wakefern provides all members of the cooperative with information system support that enables us to effectively manage our business data, customer transactions, ordering, communications and other business processes. These information systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, computer or telecommunications failures, computer viruses and related malicious software, catastrophic weather events, or human error. Any material interruption of our or Wakefern s information systems could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. 
 Due to the nature of our business, personal information about our customers, vendors and associates is received and stored in these information systems. In addition, confidential information is transmitted through our ShopRite from Home online business at shoprite.com and through the ShopRite app. Unauthorized parties may attempt to access information stored in or to sabotage or disrupt these systems. Wakefern and the Company maintain substantial security measures to prevent and detect unauthorized access to such information, including utilizing third-party service providers for monitoring our networks, security reviews, and other functions. It is possible that computer hackers, cyber terrorists and others may be able to defeat the security measures in place at the Company, Wakefern or those of third-party service providers. 
 Any breach of these security measures and loss of confidential information, which could be undetected for a period of time, could damage our reputation with customers, vendors and associates, cause Wakefern and Village to incur significant costs to protect any customers, vendors and associates whose personal data was compromised, cause us to make changes to our information systems and could result in government enforcement actions and litigation against Wakefern and/or Village from outside parties. Any such breach could have a material adverse impact on our operations, consolidated financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity if the related costs to Wakefern and Village are not covered or are in excess of carried insurance policies. In addition, a security breach could require Wakefern and Village to devote significant management resources to address problems created by the security breach and restore our reputation.

 Store opening and closing costs 

Leases 
 
 On July 28, 2019, the Company adopted ASU 2016-02, Leases. This guidance requires lessees to recognize lease liabilities and a right-of-use asset for all leases with terms of more than 12 months on the balance sheet. The Company adopted the standard using the modified retrospective approach under which the cumulative effect of initially applying the standard was recognized as an adjustment to opening fiscal 2020 retained earnings, with no restatement of prior year amounts. In addition, the Company applied the transition package of practical expedients permitted within the standard, which allowed the carryforward of historical lease classification, and applied the transition option which does not require application of the guidance to comparative periods in the year of adoption. 
 The adoption of the standard resulted in the recognition of operating lease assets and operating lease liabilities of and , respectively, as of the date of adoption. Included in the initial measurement of the new lease assets is the reclassification of certain prepaid and deferred rent balances. Additionally, the Company recorded an adjustment to reduce its opening retained earnings balance by , net of income taxes, as the Company derecognized the remaining financing obligations of and related net assets of for leases in which the Company was previously deemed to be the owner of the project for accounting purposes but did not qualify for sale-leaseback treatment. As such designation ended for these leases with adoption of the ASU, operating lease right-of-use asset and liability balances were established for these leases based on the Company's remaining fixed payment obligations under the leases and are included in the amounts described above. The adoption of this standard also resulted in a change in naming convention for leases classified historically as capital leases to finance leases. 
 The Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception, and recognizes a finance and operating lease liability and asset for all leases with terms of more than 12 months at the lease commencement date. Finance and operating lease liabilities represent the present value of minimum lease payments not yet paid. For purposes of measuring the present value of its fixed payment obligations for a given lease, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate as the discount rate implicit within its leases is generally not determinable. The Company's incremental borrowing rate reflects the rate it would pay to borrow on a secured basis, and incorporates the term and economic environment of the lease. Each renewal option is evaluated when recognizing the lease right-of-use assets and liabilities, and the Company utilizes the lease term for which it is reasonably certain to use the underlying asset. The Company is obligated under all leases to pay for real estate taxes, utilities and liability insurance, and under certain leases to pay additional amounts based on maintenance and a percentage of sales in excess of stipulated amounts. The Company accounts for rent holidays, escalating rent provisions, and construction allowances related to operating leases in rent expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Finance lease payments are charged to interest expense and depreciation and amortization expense over the lease term. Additional information on leases is provided in Note 7.

Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities 
 
 The Company records all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value. Derivatives designated and qualifying as a hedge of the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows are considered cash flow hedges. The Company records changes in the fair value of its interest rate swap contracts to Accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of taxes, as the Company has elected to designate its swaps as cash flow hedges and apply hedge accounting when the hedging relationship has satisfied the criteria necessary to apply hedge accounting. Additional information on derivative and hedging activities is provided in Note 5.

An impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets exceeds its implied fair value. Village considers earnings multiples and other valuation techniques to measure fair value at the reporting unit level, in addition to the value of the Company s stock.

classes of common stock. Class A common stock is entitled to cash dividends as declared greater than those paid on Class B common stock. Shares of Class B common stock are convertible on a share-for-share basis for Class A common stock at any time. 
 
 The Company utilizes the two-class method of computing and presenting net income per share. The two-class method is an earnings allocation formula that calculates basic and diluted net income per share for each class of common stock separately based on dividends declared and participation rights in undistributed earnings. Under the two-class method, Class A common stock is assumed to receive a greater participation in undistributed earnings than Class B common stock, in accordance with the classes' respective dividend rights. Unvested share-based payment awards that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends are treated as participating securities and therefore included in computing net income per share using the two-class method. 
 
 Diluted net income per share for Class A common stock is calculated utilizing the if-converted method, which assumes the conversion of all shares of Class B common stock to Class A common stock on a share-for-share basis, as this method is more dilutive than the two-class method. Diluted net income per share for Class B common stock does not assume conversion of Class B common stock to shares of Class A common stock.

We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. 
 
 Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. 
 
 Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
 A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the 
 47 

company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
 
 Critical Audit Matter 
 
 The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. 
 
 Evaluation of trade name intangible asset for impairment 
 
 As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company tests its indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment at the end of each fiscal year, or more frequently if circumstances dictate. Manhattan store sales have been impacted by localized residential population migration out of Manhattan and less commuter and tourist traffic during the COVID-19 pandemic. Due to uncertainty regarding the duration and extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Manhattan, the Company recognized an impairment charge related to the Fairway trade name intangible asset of 2,386 for the year ended July 31, 2021. The estimated fair value of the trade name intangible asset was determined using the relief from royalty method. The Company s indefinite-lived intangible asset balance of 13,299 as of July 31, 2021, included the Fairway trade name. 
 
 We identified the evaluation of the Company s fair value assessment of the Fairway trade name intangible asset as a critical audit matter. Challenging and subjective auditor judgment was required to evaluate estimated future revenue and the discount rate used to determine the fair value of the Fairway trade name intangible asset due to their significant measurement uncertainty. Minor changes to these assumptions had a significant effect on the Company s estimate of the fair value of the Fairway trade name intangible asset. Additionally, the audit effort associated with the evaluation of the Company s discount rate required valuation professionals with specialized skills and knowledge. 
 
 The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the Company s indefinite lived intangible asset valuation process, including controls over the future revenue and discount rate assumptions. We compared estimates of future revenue to historical actual results and to current economic trends, including the impact of, and anticipated recovery from, the COVID-19 pandemic. We performed sensitivity analyses over the future revenue assumption to assess the impact of changes on the Company s determination of fair value. We involved valuation professionals with specialized skills and knowledge, who assisted in evaluating the elements of the discount rate assumption used by management, by comparing them against publicly available market data.

VILLAGE SUPER MARKET, INC. 
 REPORTS RESULTS FOR THE FOURTH QUARTER ENDED 
 JULY 31, 2021 
 Contact John Van Orden, CFO (973) 467-2200 villageinvestorrelations wakefern.com 
 Springfield, New Jersey October 12, 2021 - Village Super Market, Inc. (NSD-VLGEA) today reported its results of operations for the fourth quarter ended July 31, 2021. 
 
 Fourth Quarter Highlights 
 Net income of 9.5 million, an increase of 3 compared to 9.2 million in the fourth quarter of the prior year 
 Adjusted net income of 8.7 million, an increase of 50 compared to 5.8 million in the fourth quarter of the prior year 
 Same store sales increased 0.1 on a two-year stacked basis same store sales increased 7.4 
 Same store digital sales decreased 22 on a two-year stacked basis same store digital sales increased 172 
 Fiscal 2021 Highlights 
 Net income of 20.0 million, a decrease of 20 compared to 24.9 million in fiscal 2020. 
 Adjusted net income of 18.9 million, a decrease of 18 compared to 23.1 million in fiscal 2020 
 Same store sales increased 1.8 on a two-year stacked basis same store sales increased 7.5 
 Same store digital sales increased 68 on a two-year stacked basis same store digital sales increased 219 
 Fourth Quarter of Fiscal 2021 Results 
 Sales were 536.3 million in the 14 weeks ended July 31, 2021 compared to 501.3 million in the 13 weeks ended July 25, 2020. Sales increased 35.4 million, or 7.1 , due to fiscal 2021 containing 53 weeks, with the additional week included in the fourth quarter. Excluding the impact of the 53rd week, sales decreased 0.1 due to the closure of the Silver Spring, Maryland store in February 2020 partially offset by the Fairway acquisition completed on May 14, 2020 and a 0.1 increase in same store sales. 
 Average basket sizes decreased, transaction counts increased and same store digital sales decreased as we cycled against the initial months following the COVID-19 outbreak in our trade area. Additionally, food inflation and increased Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program SNAP benefits positively impacted sales. Sales levels in Manhattan continue to be negatively impacted by residential population migration out of the city and less commuter and tourist traffic. 
 New stores and replacement stores are included in same store sales in the quarter after the store has been in operation for four full quarters. Store renovations and expansions are included in same store sales immediately. 
 Gross profit as a percentage of sales decreased to 28.31 in the 14 weeks ended July 31, 2021 compared to 28.91 in the 13 weeks ended July 25, 2020 due primarily to decreased departmental gross margin percentages (.29 and increased warehouse assessment charges from Wakefern (.75 ), partially offset by a favorable change in product mix (.21 and lower promotional spending (.22 ). 
 Operating and administrative expense as a percentage of sales decreased to 23.65 in the 14 weeks ended July 31, 2021 compared to 25.29 in the 13 weeks ended July 25, 2020. Adjusted operating and administrative expenses decreased to 24.29 in the 14 weeks ended July 31, 2021 compared to 25.65 in the 13 weeks ended July 25, 2020. The decrease in Adjusted operating and administrative expenses is due primarily to decreased costs related to COVID-19, including enhanced 

Exhibit 99.1 

wages and benefits, security and outside sanitation services (1.45 and lower payroll costs (.19 ). Payroll costs decreased due to productivity initiatives and labor shortages despite minimum wage and demand driven pay rate increases. 
 Impairment of assets in the 14 weeks ended July 31, 2021 includes non-cash charges related to the Fairway trade name of 2.4 million and the long-lived assets of one Gourmet Garage store of 0.5 million due primarily to the uncertainty regarding the duration and extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Manhattan. 
 The Company s effective income tax rate was 31.2 in the 14 weeks ended July 31, 2021 compared to 4.1 in the 13 weeks ended July 25, 2020. The 13 weeks ended July 25, 2020 includes a 2.5 million benefit from a federal net operating loss carryback at a rate higher than the current statutory tax rate. Excluding the impact of this adjustment, the effective income tax rate was 31.5 in the 13 weeks ended July 25, 2020. 
 Net income was 9.5 million in the 14 weeks ended July 31, 2021 compared to 9.2 million in the 13 weeks ended July 25, 2020. Adjusted net income was 8.7 million in the 14 weeks ended July 31, 2021 compared to 5.8 million in the 13 weeks ended July 25, 2020. 
 Fiscal 2021 Results 
 Sales were 2.03 billion in fiscal 2021 compared to 1.80 billion in fiscal 2020. Sales increased 35.4 million, or 2.0 , due to fiscal 2021 containing 53 weeks. Excluding the impact of the 53rd week, Sales increased due to the Fairway acquisition completed on May 14, 2020, the opening of the Stroudsburg replacement store on November 1, 2019 and a same store sales increase of 1.8 . Excluding the impact of the 53rd week, same store sales increased 7.5 in fiscal 2021 on a two-year stacked basis compared to fiscal 2019. 
 Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have experienced higher average basket sizes and decreased transaction counts as customers have consolidated shopping trips. Additionally, both food inflation and increased Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program SNAP benefits positively impacted sales. Same store digital sales growth accelerated through both ShopRite from Home and partnerships with online grocery picking and delivery services, increasing 68 in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 and 219 on a two-year stacked basis. During the COVID-19 pandemic, fiscal 2021 sales at Fairway and Gourmet Garage locations in Manhattan have been significantly negatively impacted due primarily to residential population migration out of the city and less commuter and tourist traffic. 
 Gross profit as a percentage of sales decreased to 27.83 in fiscal 2021 compared to 28.07 in fiscal 2020. Higher margins associated with Fairway increased gross profit (.22 despite higher costs as we transition and integrate commissary operations into our business. Excluding the impact of Fairway, gross profit as a percentage of sales decreased .46 due primarily to decreased departmental gross margin percentages (.48 and increased warehouse assessment charges from Wakefern (.34 partially offset by a favorable change in product mix (.17 ), lower promotional spending (.16 and increased patronage dividends and rebates received from Wakefern (.03 ). Departmental gross profits decreased due partly to price investments. 
 Operating and administrative expense as a percentage of sales decreased to 24.57 in fiscal 2021 compared to 24.65 in fiscal 2020. Adjusted operating and administrative expense as a percentage of sales increased to 24.76 in fiscal 2021 compared to 24.63 in fiscal 2020. Adjusted operating and administrative expense increased due primarily to increased occupancy costs due primarily to the Fairway acquisition (.56 and increased external fees and transportation costs associated with digital sales (.42 ), partially offset by decreased costs related to COVID-19, including enhanced wages and benefits, security and outside sanitation services (.62 and lower payroll and fringe benefit costs (.24 ). Payroll and fringe benefits decreased primarily due 

Exhibit 99.1 

to leverage from higher sales, reductions in service department offerings, labor shortages and productivity initiatives partially offset by the addition of Fairway, growth of ShopRite from Home and minimum wage and demand driven pay rate increases. 
 Depreciation and amortization expense was 34.2 million in fiscal 2021 compared to 31.4 million in fiscal 2020. Depreciation and amortization expense increased in fiscal 2021 compared to the prior year due to depreciation related to assets acquired as part of the Fairway acquisition. 
 Impairment of assets includes non-cash charges related to the Fairway trade name of 2.4 million and the long-lived assets of one Gourmet Garage store of 0.5 million due primarily to the uncertainty regarding the duration and extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Manhattan. 
 Interest expense was 3.9 million in fiscal 2021 compared to 2.6 million in fiscal 2020. Interest expense increased in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 due primarily to interest expense related to the credit agreement entered into on May 6, 2020. 
 Interest income was 3.6 million in fiscal 2021 compared to 4.1 million in fiscal 2020. Interest income decreased in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 due primarily to lower interest rates for amounts invested in variable rate notes receivable from Wakefern and demand deposits invested at Wakefern. 
 The Company s effective income tax rate was 30.7 in fiscal 2021 compared to 21.4 in fiscal 2020. Fiscal 2020 includes a 2.5 million benefit from a federal net operating loss carryback at a rate higher than the current statutory tax rate. Excluding the impact of this adjustment, the effective income tax rate was 29.3 in fiscal 2020. The increase in the effective tax rate in fiscal 2021 is due primarily to favorable return to provision adjustments in fiscal 2020 and increased state taxable income in higher tax rate jurisdictions. 
 Net income was 20.0 million in fiscal 2021 compared to 24.9 million in fiscal 2020. Adjusted net income was 18.9 million in fiscal 2021 compared to 23.1 million in fiscal 2020. 
 
 Village Super Market operates a chain of 34 supermarkets in New Jersey, New York, Maryland and Pennsylvania under the ShopRite and Fairway banners and three Gourmet Garage specialty markets in New York City.

The Company cautions the reader that there is no assurance that actual results or business conditions will not differ materially from future results, whether expressed, suggested or implied by such forward-looking statements. The Company undertakes no obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect developments or information obtained after the date hereof. The following are among the principal factors that could cause actual results to differ from the forward-looking statements risks and uncertainties related to the COVID-19 pandemic, including among others, the duration and severity of the pandemic, shifts in customers' buying patterns, disruptions to supply chains, inability of the workforce to work due to illness, quarantine or government mandates, including travel restrictions and stay at home orders, the effectiveness and duration of COVID-19 stimulus packages general economic conditions competitive pressures from the Company s operating environment the ability of the Company to maintain and improve its sales and margins the ability to attract and retain qualified associates the availability of new store locations risks, uncertainties and challenges associated with the Fairway acquisition, including under-performance relative to our expectations, additional capital requirements, unforeseen expenses or delays, imprecise assumptions or our inability to achieve projected cost savings or other synergies, competitive factors in the marketplace and difficulties integrating the business, including merging company cultures, cultivating brand strategy, expansion of food production and conforming the acquired company's technology, standards, processes, procedures and controls the availability of capital the liquidity of the Company the success of operating initiatives consumer spending patterns the impact of changing energy prices increased cost of goods sold, including increased costs from the Company s principal supplier, Wakefern disruptions or changes in Wakefern's operations the results of litigation the results of tax examinations the results of union contract negotiations competitive store openings and closings the rate of return on pension assets and other factors detailed herein and in the Company s filings with the SEC. 
 We provide non-GAAP measures, including Adjusted net income and Adjusted operating and administrative expense, that we believe are useful to analysts and investors to evaluate the Company's ongoing results of operations. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as an alternative to GAAP measures such as net income, operating income, operating and administrative expense or any other GAAP measure of performance. These measures should not be reviewed in isolation or considered as a substitute for our financial results as reported in accordance with GAAP. We believe Adjusted net income and Adjusted operating and administrative expense are useful metrics to investors and analysts because they present more accurate year-over-year comparisons of our net income and operating and administrative expense because adjusted items are not the result of our normal operations. Other companies may have different definitions of Non-GAAP Measures and provide for different adjustments, and comparability to the Company's results of operations may be impacted by such 

Exhibit 99.1 

differences. The Company's presentation of Non-GAAP Measures should not be construed as an implication that its future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items.
