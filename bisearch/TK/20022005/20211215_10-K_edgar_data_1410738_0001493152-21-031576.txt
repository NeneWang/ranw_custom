1. Business. 

The
Company was incorporated in the state of Nevada in September 1997 as All American Casting International, Inc. and changed its name to
VOIP MDU.com in 2004 and subsequently to VoIP-Pal.Com Inc. in 2006. Since March 2004, the Company has been in the development stage of
becoming a Voice-over-Internet Protocol VoIP re-seller, a provider of a proprietary transactional billing platform tailored
to the points and air mile business, and a provider of anti-virus applications for smartphones. 

In
2013, Voip-Pal acquired Digifonica International (DIL) Limited Digifonica ), to fund and co-develop Digifonica s
patent suite. Digifonica had been founded in 2003 with the vision that the internet would be the future of all forms of telecommunications
- a team of twenty top engineers with expertise in Linux and Internet telephony developed and wrote a software suite with applications
that provided solutions for several core areas of internet connectivity. In order to properly test the applications, Digifonica built
and operated three production nodes in Vancouver, Canada (Peer 1), London, UK (Teliasonera), and Denmark. Upon successfully developing
the technology, Digifonica filed for patents with the United States Patent and Trademark Office USPTO ). 

The
Digifonica patents formed the basis for Voip-Pal s current intellectual property, now a worldwide portfolio of issued and pending
patents primarily designed for the broadband VoIP market. 

The
Issuer s primary and secondary SIC Codes are 4813 and 4899. 

The
Issuer s fiscal year end date is September 30.

Amount
Spent on Research and Development 

For

Employees 

We
have two full time employees. The Company utilizes various consultants and contractors for other services. 

Emerging
Growth Company Status 

We
are an emerging growth company as that term is used in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the JOBS
Act and, as such, have elected to comply with certain reduced public company reporting requirements for future filings. 

In
April 2012, the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act JOBS Act was enacted into law. The JOBS Act provides, among other
things: 

- 
 Exemptions
 for emerging growth companies from certain financial disclosure and governance requirements for up to five years and
 provides a new form of financing to small companies; 

- 
 Amendments
 to certain provisions of the federal securities laws to simplify the sale of securities and increase the threshold number of record
 holders required to trigger the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended; 

- 
 Relaxation
 of the general solicitation and general advertising prohibition for Rule 506 offerings; 

- 
 Adoption
 of a new exemption for public offerings of securities in amounts not exceeding 50 million; and 

- 
 Exemption
 from registration by a non-reporting company of offers and sales of securities of up to 1,000,000 that comply with rules to be adopted
 by the SEC pursuant to Section 4(6) of the Securities Act and exemption of such sales from state law registration, documentation
 or offering requirements. 

In
general, under the JOBS Act a company is an emerging growth company if its initial public offering IPO of common equity securities was effected after December 8, 2011 and the company had less than 1 billion of total annual gross revenues
during its last completed fiscal year. We will retain emerging growth company status until the earliest of: 

(i) 
 the
 completion of the fiscal year in which the company has total annual gross revenues of 1 billion or more, 

(ii) 
 the
 completion of the fiscal year of the fifth anniversary of the company s IPO; 

(iii) 
 the
 company s issuance of more than 1 billion in nonconvertible debt in the prior three-year period, or 

(iv) 
 the
 company becoming a larger accelerated filer as defined under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. 

The
JOBS Act provides additional new guidelines and exemptions for non-reporting companies and for non-public offerings. Those exemptions
that impact the Company are discussed below. 

Financial
Disclosure. The financial disclosure in a registration statement filed by an emerging growth company pursuant to the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended, will differ from registration statements filed by other companies as follows: 

(i) 
 audited
 financial statements required for only two fiscal years (provided that smaller reporting companies such as the Company
 are only required to provide two years of financial statements); 

(ii) 
 selected
 financial data required for only the fiscal years that were audited (provided that smaller reporting companies such
 as the Company are not required to provide selected financial data as required by Item 301 of Regulation S-K); and 

(iii) 
 executive
 compensation only needs to be presented in the limited format now required for smaller reporting companies 

However,
the requirements for financial disclosure provided by Regulation S-K promulgated by the Rules and Regulations of the SEC already provide
certain of these exemptions for smaller reporting companies. The Company is a smaller reporting company. Currently a smaller reporting
company is not required to file as part of its registration statement selected financial data and only needs to include audited financial
statements for its two most current fiscal years with no required tabular disclosure of contractual obligations. 

The
JOBS Act also exempts the Company s independent registered public accounting firm from having to comply with any rules adopted
by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board PCAOB after the date of the JOBS Act s enactment, except as otherwise
required by SEC rule. 

The
JOBS Act further exempts an emerging growth company from any requirement adopted by the PCAOB for mandatory rotation of
the Company s accounting firm or for a supplemental auditor report about the audit. 

Internal
Control Attestation. The JOBS Act also provides an exemption from the requirement of the Company s independent registered public
accounting firm to file a report on the Company s internal control over financial reporting, although management of the Company
is still required to file its report on the adequacy of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Section 102(a)
of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from the requirements in 14A(e) of the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934 for companies with a class of securities registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, to hold shareholder
votes for executive compensation and golden parachutes. 

Other
Items of the JOBS Act. The JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can communicate with potential investors
that are qualified institutional buyers or institutions that are accredited to determine interest in a contemplated offering either prior
to or after the date of filing the respective registration statement. The JOBS Act also permits research reports by a broker or dealer
about an emerging growth company regardless of whether such report provides sufficient information for an investment decision.
In addition, the JOBS Act precludes the SEC and FINRA from adopting certain restrictive rules or regulations regarding brokers, dealers
and potential investors, communications with management and distribution of research reports on the emerging growth company s 
IPOs. 

Section
106 of the JOBS Act permits emerging growth companies to submit registration statements under the Securities Act of 1933,
as amended, on a confidential basis provided that the registration statement and all amendments thereto are publicly filed at least 21
days before the issuer conducts any road show. This is intended to allow emerging growth companies to explore the IPO option
without disclosing to the market the fact that it is seeking to go public or disclosing the information contained in its registration
statement until the company is ready to conduct a roadshow. 

Election
to Opt Out of Transition Period. Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required
to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies (that is, those that have not had a Securities Act
of 1933, as amended, registration statement declared effective or do not have a class of securities registered under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standard. 

The
JOBS Act provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to
non-emerging growth companies but any such election to opt out is irrevocable. The Company has elected not to opt out of the transition
period. This may make comparison of the Company s financial statements with any other public company which is not either an emerging
growth company nor an emerging growth company which has opted out of using the extended transition period difficult
or impossible as possible different or revised standards may be used. 

For
so long as we remain an emerging growth company as defined in the JOBS Act, we may take advantage of certain exemptions
from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies 
as described above. We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we will rely on some or all of
these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for
our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile. If we avail ourselves of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements,
as is currently our plan, our reduced disclosure may make it more difficult for investors and securities analysts to evaluate us and
may result in less investor confidence.

5. Market for Registrant s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities. 

Market 

Our
common stock is quoted on the OTCQB with the OTC Markets Group, Inc. under the symbol VPLM . The OTCQB is an inter-dealer
quotation and trading system where market makers apply to quote securities. Accordingly, the OTCQB is not considered a market, and there
is, therefore, no public market for our Common Stock. 

Holders 

We
had approximately 458 holders of record of our common stock as of September 30, 2021 according to the books of our transfer agent. The
number of our stockholders of record excludes any estimate by us of the number of beneficial owners of shares held in street name, the
accuracy of which cannot be guaranteed. 

Dividends 

We
have not declared a dividend on our common stock, and we do not anticipate the payment of dividends in the near future as we intend to
reinvest our profits to grow our business. There are no restrictions in our articles of incorporation or bylaws that restrict us from
declaring dividends. The Nevada Revised Statutes, however, does prohibit us from declaring dividends where, after giving effect to the
distribution of the dividend: 

we
 would not be able to pay our debts as they become due in the usual course of business; or 

our
 total assets would be less than the sum of our total liabilities, plus the amount that would be needed to satisfy the rights of shareholders
 who have preferential rights superior to those receiving the distribution

CORPORATE
HISTORY, OVERVIEW AND PRINCIPAL BUSINESS 

VoIP-PAL.com
Inc. (the Company was incorporated in the state of Nevada in September 1997 as All American Casting International, Inc.
and changed its name to VOIP MDI.com in 2004 and subsequently to Voip-Pal.Com Inc. in 2006. Since March 2004, the Company has been in
the development stage of becoming a Voice-over-Internet Protocol VoIP re-seller, a provider of a proprietary transactional
billing platform tailored to the points and air mile business, and a provider of anti-virus applications for smartphones. All business
activities prior to March 2004 have been abandoned and written off to deficit. 

In
2013, the Company acquired Digifonica International (DIL) Limited Digifonica ), to fund and co-develop Digifonica s
patent suite. Digifonica had been founded in 2003 with the vision that the internet would be the future of all forms of telecommunications
- a team of twenty top engineers with expertise in Linux and Internet telephony developed and wrote a software suite with applications
that provided solutions for several core areas of internet connectivity. In order to properly test the applications, Digifonica built
and operated three production nodes in Vancouver, Canada (Peer 1), London, UK (Teliasonera), and Denmark. Upon successfully developing
the technology, Digifonica filed for patents with the United States Patent and Trademark Office USPTO ). 

The
Digifonica patents formed the basis for the Company s current intellectual property, now a worldwide portfolio of twenty-six issued
and pending patents primarily designed for the broadband VoIP market. 

The
Company s intellectual property value is derived from its issued and pending patents. The inventions described in these patents,
among other things, provide the means to integrate VoIP services with legacy telecommunications systems such as the public switched telephone
network (PSTN) to create a seamless service using either legacy telephone numbers or IP addresses, and enhance the performance and value
of VoIP implementations worldwide. 

VoIP
has been and continues to be a green field for innovation that has spawned numerous inventions, greatly benefitting consumers large and
small across the globe. VoIP is used in many places and by every modern telephony system vendor, network supplier, and retail and wholesale
carrier. 

Results
of Operations 

The
Company s operating costs consist of expenses incurred to monetizing, selling and licensing its VoIP patents. Other operating costs
include expenses for legal, accounting and other professional fees, financing costs, and other general and administrative expenses.

Off
Balance Sheet Arrangements 

Performance
Bonus Payable 

In
2016, the board of directors authorized the Company to provide a performance bonus (the Performance Bonus of up to 3 
of the capital stock of the Company by way of the issuance of Common shares from its treasury to an as yet undetermined group of related
and non-related parties upon the occurrence of a bonusable event, defined as the successful completion of a sale of the Company or substantially
all its assets, or a major licensing transaction. In order to provide maximum flexibility to the Company with respect to determining
the level of Performance Bonus payable, and who may qualify to receive a pro-rata share of such a Performance Bonus, the Company authorized
full discretion to the Board in making such determinations. 

In
2019, the board of directors authorized the increase of the Performance Bonus to up to 10 of the capital stock of the Company. Concurrently,
the directors authorized 66.67 of the Performance Bonus to be issued in an advance payment of an aggregate 127,000,000 Common shares Bonus Shares to a group of related and non-related parties, which included members of management, a director and several
consultants. 60,000,000 of the Bonus Shares are restricted from trading under Rule 144 and subject to voluntary lock-up agreements under
which they cannot be traded, pledged, hypothecated, transferred or sold by the holders until such time as the Company has met the requirements
of the bonusable event as described above. 

As
at September 30, 2021, no bonusable event had occurred and there was no Performance Bonus payable. 

Impact
of Inflation 

We
believe that inflation has not had a material impact on our results of operations for the nine months ending September 30, 2021. We cannot
assure you that future inflation will not have an adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition. 

Impact
of COVID-19 

In
March 2020, the World Health Organization declared a global pandemic related to the COVID-19 coronavirus. Its impact on global economies
has been far-reaching and businesses around the world are being forced to cease or limit operations for long or indefinite periods of
time. Measures taken to contain the spread of the COVID-19 virus, including travel bans, quarantines, social distancing, and closures
of non-essential services have triggered significant disruptions to businesses worldwide, resulting in an economic slowdown. Global stock
markets have also experienced great volatility and significant declines. Governments and central banks have responded with monetary and
fiscal interventions to stabilize economic conditions. 

The
duration and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the effectiveness of government and central bank responses, remains unclear
at this time. It is not possible to reliably estimate the duration and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic, nor its impact on the financial
position and results of the Company in future periods. The Company is proceeding with its business activities as long as the work environment
remains safe at this point there has been minimal disruption to day-to-day operations resulting from health and safety measures.
Disruptions and volatility in the global capital markets may increase the Company s cost of capital and adversely impact access
to capital.

Opinion
on the Consolidated Financial Statements 

We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Voip-Pal.com Inc. (the Company as of September 30, 2021 and
2020, and the related consolidated statements of loss and comprehensive loss, cash flows, and stockholders equity for the years
ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, and the related notes and schedules (collectively referred to as the financial statements ).
In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of September
30, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations its cash flows for the years ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 

Going
Concern 

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note
1 to the financial statements, the entity has suffered recurring losses from operations and has a net capital deficiency that raise substantial
doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management s plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note
1. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

Basis
for Opinion 

These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United
States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities
laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company
is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits
we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion
on the effectiveness of the entity s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our
audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error
or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

We
have served as the Company s auditor since 2015.

 Notes
to the Consolidated Financial Statements 

 (Expressed

 September
30, 2021 

(September 30, 2020 - ). The ability of the Company
to continue operations as a going concern is dependent upon raising additional working capital, settling outstanding debts and generating
profitable operations. These material uncertainties raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going
concern. Should the going concern assumption not continue to be appropriate, further adjustments to carrying values of assets and liabilities
may be required. There can be no assurance that capital will be available as necessary to meet these continued developments and operating
costs or, if the capital is available, that it will be on the terms acceptable to the Company. The issuances of additional stock by the
Company may result in a significant dilution in the equity interests of its current shareholders. Obtaining commercial loans, assuming
those loans would be available, will increase the Company s liabilities and future cash commitments. If the Company is unable to
obtain financing in the amounts and on terms deemed acceptable, its business and future success may be adversely affected. 

Additionally,
as the Company s stated objective is to monetize its patent suite through the licensing or sale of its intellectual property IP ),
the Company being forced to litigate or to defend its IP claims through litigation casts substantial doubt on its future to continue
as a going concern. IP litigation is generally a costly process, and in the absence of revenue the Company must raise capital to continue
its own defense and to validate its claims in the event of a failure to defend its patent claims, either because of lack of funding,
a court ruling against the Company or because of a protracted litigation process, there can be no assurance that the Company will be
able to raise additional capital to pay for an appeals process or a lengthy trial. The outcome of any litigation process may have a significant
adverse effect on the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. 

COVID-19 

In
March 2020, the World Health Organization declared a global pandemic related to the COVID-19 coronavirus. Its impact on global economies
has been far-reaching and businesses around the world are being forced to cease or limit operations for long or indefinite periods of
time. Measures taken to contain the spread of the COVID-19 virus, including travel bans, quarantines, social distancing, and closures
of non-essential services have triggered significant disruptions to businesses worldwide, resulting in an economic slowdown. Global stock
markets have also experienced great volatility and significant declines. Governments and central banks have responded with monetary and
fiscal interventions to stabilize economic conditions. 

The
duration and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the effectiveness of government and central bank responses, remains unclear
at this time. It is not possible to reliably estimate the duration and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic, nor its impact on the financial
position and results of the Company in future periods. The Company is proceeding with its business activities as long as the work environment
remains safe at this point there has been minimal disruption to day-to-day operations resulting from health and safety measures.
Disruptions and volatility in the global capital markets may increase the Company s cost of capital and adversely impact access
to capital.

Value of Financial Instruments (cont d) 

Valuation
techniques used to measure fair value maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. The standard
describes the following fair value hierarchy based on three levels of inputs, of which the first two are considered observable and the
last unobservable, that may be used to measure fair value: 

Level
 1: Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities. 

Level
 2: Inputs other than Level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities;
 quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data
 for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. 

Level
 3: Unobservable inputs supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities. 

The
fair value of cash is classified as Level 1 at September 30, 2021 and 2020. 

The

full discretion to the Board in making such determinations. 

In

Item
9A. Controls and Procedures. 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Management
conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2021.
In making this assessment, management used the criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee
of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, or COSO. The COSO framework summarizes each of the components of a company s
internal control system, including (i) the control environment, (ii) risk assessment, (iii) control activities, (iv) information and
communication, and (v) monitoring. In management s assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting
(as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f)) as required by Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(c), our management concluded as of the end of the
fiscal period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that our internal control over financial reporting has not been completely
efficient or effective. The Company intends to address these deficiencies in internal controls as soon as possible. 

As
defined by Auditing Standard No. 5, An Audit of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting that is Integrated with an Audit of
Financial Statements and Related Independence Rule and Conforming Amendments, established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board PCAOB ), a material weakness is a deficiency or combination of deficiencies that results more than a remote likelihood
that a material misstatement of annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected. In connection with the assessment
described above, management identified the following control deficiencies that represent material weaknesses as of September 30, 2021: 

1) 
 Lack
 of segregation of duties. Now, our resources and size prevent us from being able to employ sufficient resources to enable us to have
 adequate segregation of duties within our internal control system. Management will periodically reevaluate this situation. 

2) 
 Lack
 of an independent audit committee. Although the Board of Directors serves an audit committee it is not comprised solely of independent
 directors. We may establish an audit committee comprised solely of independent directors when we have sufficient capital resources
 and working capital to attract qualified independent directors and to maintain such a committee. 

3) 
 Insufficient
 number of independent directors. Now, our Board of Directors does not consist of a majority of independent directors, a factor that
 is counter to corporate governance practices as set forth by the rules of various stock exchanges. 

Our
management determined that these deficiencies constituted material weaknesses. Due to a lack of financial resources, we are not able
to, and do not intend to, immediately take any action to remediate these material weaknesses. We will not be able to do so until we acquire
sufficient financing to do so. We will implement further controls as circumstances, cash flow, and working capital permit. Notwithstanding
the assessment that our ICFR was not effective and that there were material weaknesses as identified in this report, we believe that
our financial statements fairly present our financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the years covered thereby in
all material respects. 

Disclosure
controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our
reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act are recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified
in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed
to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management,
including our Chief Executive Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Limitations
on the Effectiveness of Internal Controls 

Our
management does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will necessarily
prevent all fraud and material error. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving
our objectives and our Chief Executive Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective at that reasonable
assurance level. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits
of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of
controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within our company have been detected.
These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because
of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or
more people, or by management override of the internal control. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain
assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated
goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

There
have been no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting during the year ended September 30, 2021 that have materially
affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect such controls.
