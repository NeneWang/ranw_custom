On December 16, 2005, the Company merged with Fresh Harvest Products, Inc., and then changed its name to Fresh Harvest Products, Inc., and began operating as a natural and organic food and beverage company. In 2012, the Company began focusing its efforts on developing software and mobile application development and video production and developing an e-book company, and in the intervening years, expanded its technology development and development efforts, creating a revenue sharing partnership with a mobile app, TreatER (available for free on the Apple App Store) in 2017 and in 2018, focusing on building a software program for financially valuing a film concept and mapping the predicted human behavior by region to films using a combination of geographical based social sentiment and the distribution data and financial performance of historically released films. On November 4, 2017, the Company redomiciled from New Jersey to Delaware, and changed its fiscal year end from October 31 st to June 30 th . On March 9, 2021, the Company effectuated a 10,000:1 reverse split, changed its stock symbol from FRHV to IMTH, and changed its name to Innovative MedTech, Inc. On March 25, 2021, the Company acquired two companies, Sarah Adult Day Services, Inc., and Sarah Day Care Centers, Inc. (collectively SarahCare ), an adult day care center franchisor and provider. With 26 centers (2 corporate and 24 franchise locations) located in 13 states, SarahCare offers seniors daytime care and activities focusing on meeting their physical and medical needs on a daily basis, and ranging from nursing care to salon services and providing meals, to offering engaging and enriching activities to allow them to continue to lead active and engaged lives. We are now focusing all of our efforts on our senior care operations. General Overview Description of Business The Company is a provider of health and wellness services. On March 25, 2021, the Company acquired SarahCare for a total of 3,718,833; 2,000,110 was paid in cash and the Company assumed approximately 393,885 in debt due to sellers, and the remaining is payable through a royalty fee liability due in the amount of 1,500,000. With 26 centers (2 corporate and 24 franchise locations) located in 13 states, SarahCare offers seniors daytime care and activities focusing on meeting their physical and medical needs on a daily basis, and ranging from nursing care to salon services and providing meals, to offering engaging and enriching activities to allow them to continue to lead active and engaged lives. 4 Table of Contents Overview and Mission Our mission is to be one of the market leaders in the adult day care center market and to be a leader in related technologies in the health and wellness category. We believe that this is a fragmented market, and this is an opportune time to consolidate and grow our SarahCare brand. We have an experienced management team of adult day care industry and financial markets executives that have strong relationships in the industry. Operational Overview SarahCare, our wholly owned subsidiary SarahCare provides health-care related services and companionship for older adults, aged 60 and above, and for adults aged 18-60 who are in need of health-related care and supervision (a SARAH Business since February 1985. In 1985, the very first SarahCare Center opened its doors in Canton, Ohio. Originally called S.A.R.A.H. (Senior Adult Recreation and Health), the facility was one of the first intergenerational sites in the U.S. The senior adult day care center was located next to a child day care center and served as a training and research site for the development of other unique intergenerational programs across the country. Eventually, directors transitioned S.A.R.A.H. s name to Sarah Center and, finally, to SarahCare demonstrating the philosophy of care administered to our seniors and their families. We grant franchises for the operation of a SARAH Business. A SARAH Business provides non-medical care for elderly individuals and others in need of health-related care and supervision who desire compassionate care and stimulating activity in a secure, structured environment. We provide service that offers an effective solution for individuals who are in need of support services in order to continue living in their communities. Currently, SarahCare operates 26 unique locations in the United States (24 franchised locations and 2 corporate owned centers) and internationally in the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia. Center members who visit any one of our locations across 13 states are offered daytime care and activities ranging from exercise and health-care related needs on a daily basis to nursing care and salon services. Visitors benefit from additional services that include specialized dietary menus and engaging social activities allowing them to continue to lead active and enriched lives. Accreditation SarahCare s two corporate-owned centers have achieved accreditation through the Aging Services division of CARF, an independent, non-profit accreditor of health and human services. Through accreditation, CARF assists service providers in improving the quality of their services, demonstrating value, and meeting internationally recognized organizational and program standards. The accreditation process applies sets of standards to service areas and business practices during an on-site survey. Accreditation, however, is an ongoing process, signaling to the public that a service provider is committed to continuously improving services, encouraging feedback, and serving the center. Accreditation also demonstrates a provider s commitment to enhance its performance, manage its risk, and distinguish its service delivery. Who we care for We have trained staff including nurses who specialize in caring for those with various impairments and health related problems, including but not limited to: frailty and physical dependence, memory impairment, stroke and parkinsons disease, chronic diseases, and isolation and depression. 5 Table of Contents Nursing assistants and other trained staff are always there to assist family members in ambulating and moving through all of our activities throughout the day. Activities are adapted for specific physical challenges so that no one ever feels left out. Yes, seniors who are wheelchair bound are very welcome in our centers. We handle a loved one s challenging issues with care and consideration. If a loved one is wheelchair bound, multiple staff members are available at any given time if they need the assistance of more than one person. If a loved one needs help with toileting and/or bathing, we have specially trained staff to assist them. Our bathing areas are designed to give them as much privacy and dignity as possible. Activities - Our centers offer versatile daily services and activities. Some of the benefits included in our daily fee are: NURSING - licensed nursing staff under the supervision of an RN for better care of chronic diseases FOOD - delicious catered meals with special diets accommodated ACTIVITIES - customized to your loved one s interests and abilities SOCIALIZATION - be with friends, remain active, and enjoy the day Nursing Services - While our participants enjoy their day at SarahCare, our center nurses provide the care and monitoring they need on a regular basis. Care is provided in the privacy of our nurse s clinic. Our centers are staffed with the qualified Registered and/or Licensed nurses. They are often specially certified and trained to work with issues related to aging and the elderly, and are passionate about caring for seniors. Nursing services that are offered include: Medication administration and oversight Weight and vital signs monitored and recorded regularly Diabetic care Care of feeding tubes and ostomies Dressing changes Other services needed by you or your loved one or as ordered by a physician Meals We offer delicious and nutritious meals at no extra cost. Meals are the perfect time for friends to socialize and celebrate, sharing memories and exchanging jokes. Our beautiful dining rooms and delicious food help turn each meal into a special event. A light breakfast, a delicious catered lunch, and afternoon snack are all included in the daily rate. Special diets are easily accommodated and assistance at meal time is always available. I ntergenerational - Our intergenerational program brings together seniors and children in a safe and engaging environment. Grandparents and grandchildren have so much to share and can be a great source of joy to each other, yet they rarely have these opportunities. SarahCare intergenerational programs bring both generations together in a structured environment where they can learn from each other sharing their feelings, ideas, skills, and affection. Unlike other informal and casual get-togethers, our intergenerational program was scientifically designed and researched to encourage these interactions and allow our seniors to participate fully from disabled and frail elders to sufferers of dementia and Parkinson s. Customized Programs - Home Care - A participant s time with SarahCare s specially-trained staff doesn t have to stop at the end of the day. Some seniors who are still living independently at home may require assistance during evenings and weekends, when they can t spend time at the center. Or, if a loved one resides with their family, occurrences may come up that require the family to be away from home during an evening or weekend when your senior requires care. Franchisees - Our franchisees pay us a variety of royalties and fees. Typical locations are commercial or professional office locations convenient to working caregivers. The approximate size of a SARAH Business facility is 5,000-6,000 square feet. Rent is estimated to be 96,000- 140,000 annually depending on size, condition and location of leased premises. 6 Table of Contents State and Federal Licenses. Both the company owned centers and the franchise centers acquire the required licenses prior to opening in their respective states. Not all states, such as Ohio, require a license to operate an ADHC (Adult Day Health Center), while other states, such as Pennsylvania, have strict licensing regulations. If a center wants to accept Medicaid participants, then they must complete the Medicaid certification process. The VA (Veterans Affairs) has their own standards and survey process in order to obtain an agreement/contract with the VA. All of these programs are administered by individual states. Every center follows the regulations as interpreted by the VA center in the specific areain which their center is located. The federal program the Child Adult Food Care Program (CACFP) is for the reimbursement of food, and is administered by the Department of Agriculture. If a center wants to utilize CACFP, then they must complete the Department of Agriculture s application and survey process. All centers are surveyed annually by their state licensing department (if applicable), Medicaid, the VA, the CACFP (if applicable) and any additional funding source they may be using. In addition, most centers are surveyed by their local Health and Fire Departments annually. Goods and Services One Must Acquire From An Approved Supplier Or In Accordance With Our Standards and Specifications The trademarks, trade names, service marks, and logos must be properly depicted on any brochures, business cards and stationery, signage, forms, and public relations materials you purchase for use in your operation of the SARAH Business. These items, and other products, supply items and services, may be purchased from any source; however, we retain the right to, at any time in the future, condition the right to buy or lease goods and/or services on their meeting minimum standards and specifications and/or being acquired from suppliers we specifically designate or approve. We may issue and modify standards from time to time and enumerate them in our Operations Manual or other communications. A Franchisee must purchase software to be used in the operation of the SARAH Business from a designated supplier. They may acquire certain pre-approved social media channels and online content for the SARAH Business only through us or our designated supplier. (Currently our System standards include Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, Instagram, Pinterest, and LinkedIn and no other channels, as approved social media outlets through which SARAH Businesses may be promoted.) A Franchisee must use the e-mail accounts we provide to you. We also currently recommend that they use our approved suppliers for: real estate site selection services; furniture, fixtures and equipment; marketing materials; computer software, and printing services. Otherwise, there currently are no goods, services, supplies, fixtures, equipment, inventory, computer hardware, real estate, or comparable items related to establishing or operating the SARAH Business that you must buy from us, our affiliate, or an approved supplier. None of our officers currently owns an interest in any supplier to SARAH Businesses. If a Franchisee wants to purchase or lease any product, supply, item or service from a supplier or provider that we have not already approved, they must first obtain our approval. They may request our approval by providing us with a sample of the item they would like us to approve. We will use commercially reasonable efforts to notify the Franchisee within 30 days after receiving all samples and any other requested information or specifications, whether they are authorized to purchase or lease the product or service from that supplier or provider. We do not charge a fee for engaging in this approval process. In the event we receive rebates from any suppliers to our franchisees, these funds will be used for marketing and promotional purposes. We estimate that, collectively, the purchases and leases you obtain according to our specifications or from approved or designated suppliers represent between 2.5 -7.5 of your total purchases and leases in connection with the establishment and operation of the SARAH Business. During the fiscal year ending June 30, 2021, we did not receive any rebates or other payments from suppliers based on their sales to franchisees and neither we nor our affiliates sold or leased any products or services to franchisees. 7 Table of Contents Insurance Besides these purchases or leases, a potential Franchisee must obtain and maintain, at their own expense, the insurance coverage that we periodically require and satisfy other insurance-related obligations. They currently must obtain the following insurance: (i) comprehensive commercial general liability insurance, including bodily injury, property damage, personal injury, products and completed operations liability coverage with a combined single limit of not less than 1,000,000 per occurrence for bodily injuries, 1,000,000 per occurrence for property damage and 2,000,000 annual aggregate, (ii) workers compensation and employer s liability insurance to meet statutory requirements of that of operation where the SARAH Business is located; (iii) commercial property insurance at replacement value, including fire, vandalism, and extended coverage insurance with primary and excess limits of not less than the full replacement value of the SARAH Business and its furniture, fixtures and equipment; (iv) automobile liability insurance for all owned, non-owned and hired automobiles with a single coverage limit of not less than 1,000,000; (v) other insurance as may be required by the state or locality in which the SARAH Business is located and operated; and (vi) professional liability insurance of not less than 1,000,000. All of the policies they maintain must contain the minimum coverage described above and must have deductibles not to exceed the amounts we specify. Each of the insurance policies must be issued by an insurance company of recognized responsibility and satisfactory to us. We may periodically increase the amounts of coverage required under these insurance policies and/or require different or additional insurance coverages at any time. The commercial general liability, automobile, and umbrella insurance policies must list us as additional insured parties and provide for 30 days prior written notice to us in the event of a policy s material modification, cancellation, or expiration. They must furnish us with a copy of your Certificate of Insurance within 10 business days upon receipt of your Occupancy Permit for the SARAH Business. If they fail or refuse to obtain or maintain the insurance we specify, in addition to our other remedies including termination, we may obtain such insurance for you and the SARAH Business, on the potential Franchisee s behalf, in which event they must cooperate with us and reimburse us for all premiums, costs and expenses we incur in obtaining and maintaining the insurance, plus a reasonable fee for our time incurred in obtaining such insurance. Advertising Materials Before a potential Franchisee uses them, they must send to us for review samples of all advertising, promotional and marketing materials which we have not prepared or previously approved. They must not use any advertising, promotional, or marketing materials that we have not approved or have disapproved. During approximately the first 3 months of operating the SARAH Business, we will use the Marketing Deposit to pay vendors selected to provide advertising and related services for the promotion of the SARAH Business, which may include, for example, arranging online Internet advertising and marketing content, including Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, Instagram, Pinterest, LinkedIn or other social media outlets and paying click-through charges to search engines, banner advertising sources, and advertising host sites to promote the SARAH Business. We may develop certain promotional materials and/or designate or approve specific suppliers of promotional materials during the franchise term that we may require them to purchase and use. All online marketing activities you conduct for the SARAH Business must meet our then-current guidelines for franchisee use of social media that we include as part of the Operations Manual or otherwise communicate as part of our System standards. Development of Your SARAH Business A potential Franchisee is responsible for locating, obtaining, and developing a site for the SARAH Business within the Territory. They must submit a proposed site for the SARAH Business for our approval in a form we specify that includes detailed construction drawings and other site-specific information. After we approve a site for the SARAH Business, they are responsible for constructing and equipping the SARAH Business at that site. They may not begin developing any site or constructing or remodeling any structures or fixtures before we have approved the site. They may consult with real estate and other professionals of their choosing, and we may also assist you in the development of the SARAH Business. They must submit to us for our approval detailed plans and specifications adopting our then-current plans and specifications for SARAH Businesses. SarahCare, as the franchisor, supplies the Franchisee s with initial assistance and approval with the following: 1. Give you our site selection criteria for the SARAH Business and, upon a potential Franchisee s request, provide input regarding possible sites. We do not own and lease any site to franchisees. After they select and we approve a site, we will designate the geographic area within which they may establish the SARAH Business. 8 Table of Contents 2. Approve the signage. 3. Identify the standards and specifications for products, services, and materials that comply with the System, and, if we require, the approved suppliers of these items. We will furnish a potential Franchisee with the listing of the package of initial franchise items as detailed in the Operations Manual. Neither we nor our affiliate provide, deliver, or install any of these items. 4. Provide an Initial Training Program. 5. Provide an Operations Training Program. Once the Franchisee s SarahCare business is operational, we will: 1. Issue and modify System standards for SARAH Businesses. 2. Provide access to a copy of our Operations Manual as we make available through our intranet. The Operations Manual contains mandatory and suggested specifications, standards and operating procedure. 3. Give you additional or special guidance and assistance and training as we deem appropriate and for which a potential Franchisee are financially responsible. 4. Inspect and observe the operation of the SARAH Business to help a potential Franchisee comply with the Franchise Agreement and all System standards. 5. Let you use the confidential information. 6. Let you use the Marks. Opening We estimate that a potential Franchisee will open the SARAH Business within 8 to 10 months after they sign the Franchise Agreement. The interval between signing the Franchise Agreement and opening the SARAH Business depends on the site s location and condition, the construction schedule for the SARAH Business, the extent to which they must upgrade or remodel an existing location, the delivery schedule for equipment and supplies, securing financing arrangements, completing training, and complying with local laws and regulations.

Kingwood, TX 77339 We have 2 international centers in the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia, that are franchised, but are not yet open. We do not have an expected date as to when they will be open, if ever. 9 Table of Contents Below is a list of our current corporate (2) locations: SarahCare of Belden - 6199 Frank Ave NW, North Canton OH 44720 SarahCare of Stow - 4472 Darrow Road, Stow OH 44224 Our Growth Strategy Our sales and marketing teams intend to leverage our value proposition and strong participant satisfaction to promote our brand and attract new participants to our centers. The size of our centers depends on the size of the addressable population within each service area. We first determine whether we can fill a center s expected participant census, then, as a center reaches its initial capacity, we plan to increase its size through pre-planned facility expansions. Once we have reached planned capacity, we intend to expand to other locations. Our growth strategy includes renewing our current franchised locations. Recently, SarahCare renewed its agreements regarding two SarahCare franchised locations, one in The Woodlands, Texas, and one in Kingwood, Texas. Both renewals are for five years. Leasing New Market Space We plan to build new centers or lease from existing market space to enter new markets for our daycare centers into adjacent or new geographies. The placement of our centers in attractive locations is critical to our success. We regularly conduct zip code level analyses and convene small focus groups with potential participants and caregivers to identify service areas with attractive concentrations of seniors eligible for our daycare services and select optimal sites for our centers. We prioritize service areas with populations that include more than 4,000 potential participants within a 60-minute drive of a center. Our approach to building new daycare centers or leasing space in favorable market areas is based on our experience-based specifications, with flexibility for future center expansion factored into the blueprints where possible. On April 21, 2021, the Company, through ten newly-formed, wholly-owned limited liability companies, entered into lease agreements with entities controlled by our Chairman, Charles Everhardt, for ten additional SarahCare locations to be operated by the Company. All of the leases are for a ten-year period beginning on July 1, 2021, and ending on June 30, 2031, with a 5-year renewal option. The rent for each location is 7,500 per month. As of June 30, 2021, the Company has amended the leases to delay commencement until November 1, 2021. The ten locations are as follows: Texas 6121 N Interstate Highway 35, Austin, TX 78752 approximately 8,500 sq. ft. 9090 Southwest Freeway, Houston, TX 77074 approximately 8,500 sq. ft.

Our financial statements are stated in U.S. Dollars and are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles of the United States GAAP ). Going Concern Qualification Several conditions and events cast substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The Company has incurred cumulative net losses of 14,916,012 since its inception and requires capital for its contemplated operational and marketing activities to take place. The Company s ability to raise additional capital through debt or future issuances of capital stock is unknown. The obtainment of additional financing, the successful development of the Company s contemplated plan of operations, and its transition, ultimately, to the attainment of profitable operations are necessary for the Company to continue operations. The ability to successfully resolve these factors raises substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. Operating Results Our operating results for the years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, and the changes between those periods for the respective items, are summarized as follows: Year Ended 30-Jun Change 2021 2020 Amount Operating loss (708,875 (378,371 (330,504 Other expense (2,556,082 (111,324 (2,444,758 Net loss (3,264,957 (489,695 (2,775,262 Revenues Our revenue increased to 349,143 for the year ended June 30, 2021, from revenue of 0 in the comparative year ended June 30, 2020 due to our acquisition of SarahCare.

Principles of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries. The ownership interest of consolidated entities not wholly-owned by the Company are presented as noncontrolling interests in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation, and net income (loss) is reduced by the portion of net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests. The Company reports investments in unconsolidated entities over whose operating and financial policies it has the ability to exercise significant influence under the equity method of accounting. The Company evaluates its potential variable interest entity ("VIE") relationships under certain criteria as provided for in Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 810, Consolidation ("ASC 810"). ASC 810 broadly defines a VIE as an entity with one or more of the following characteristics: (a) the total equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance the entity's activities without additional subordinated financial support; (b) as a group, the holders of the equity investment at risk lack (i) the ability to make decisions about the entity's activities through voting or similar rights, (ii) the obligation to absorb the expected losses of the entity, or (iii) the right to receive the expected residual returns of the entity; or (c) the equity investors have voting rights that are not proportional to their economic interests, and substantially all of the entity's activities either involve, or are conducted on behalf of, an investor that has disproportionately few voting rights. The Company performs this evaluation on an ongoing basis and consolidates any VIEs for which the Company is determined to be the primary beneficiary, as determined by the Company's power to direct the VIE's activities and the obligation to absorb its losses or the right to receive its benefits, which are potentially significant to the VIE. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Because of the use of estimates inherent in the financial reporting process, actual results may differ significantly from those estimates. Cash and Cash Equivalents The Company maintains cash balances in a non-interest bearing account that sometimes exceeds over 250,000 federally insured limits. For the purpose of the statements of cash flows, all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less are considered to be cash equivalents. There were no cash equivalents as of June 30, 2021, and 2020. Earnings Per Share Calculation Basic earnings per common share EPS is computed by dividing income available to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per shares is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average shares outstanding, assuming all dilutive potential common shares were issued. 21 Table of Contents Revenue Recognition Participant Fees Resident fee revenue is reported at the amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for the services provided. These amounts are due from participants or third-party payors and include variable consideration for retroactive adjustments from estimated reimbursements, if any, under reimbursement programs. Performance obligations are determined based on the nature of the services provided. Resident fee revenue is recognized as performance obligations are satisfied. Under the Company's day care agreements, which are generally for a contractual term of 30 days to one year, the Company provides services to participants for a stated daily or monthly fee. The Company has elected the lessor practical expedient within ASC 842, Leases ("ASC 842") and recognizes, measures, presents, and discloses the revenue for services under the Company's senior living residency agreements based upon the predominant component, either the lease or nonlease component, of the contracts. The Company has determined that the services included under the Company's independent living, assisted living, and memory care residency agreements have the same timing and pattern of transfer and are performance obligations that are satisfied over time. The Company recognizes revenue under ASC 606, Revenue Recognition from Contracts with Customers ("ASC 606") for its participants agreements for which it has estimated that the nonlease components of such agreements are the predominant component of the contract. The Company enters into contracts to provide home assisted health, and certain outpatient services. Each service provided under the contract is capable of being distinct, and thus, the services are considered individual and separate performance obligations. The performance obligations are satisfied as services are provided and revenue is recognized as services are provided. The Company receives payment for services under various third-party payor programs which include Medicaid, Veterans Affairs and other third-party payors. Estimates for settlements with third-party payors for retroactive adjustments from estimated reimbursements due to audits, reviews, or investigations are included in the determination of the estimated transaction price for providing services. The Company estimates the transaction price based on the terms of the contract with the payor, correspondence with the payor, and historical payment trends. Changes to these estimates for retroactive adjustments are recognized in the period the change or adjustment becomes known or when final settlements are determined. Billings for services under third-party payor programs are recorded net of estimated retroactive adjustments, if any. Retroactive adjustments are accrued on an estimated basis in the period the related services are rendered and adjusted in future periods or as final settlements are determined. Contractual or cost related adjustments from Medicaid or Veterans Affairs are accrued when assessed (without regard to when the assessment is paid or withheld). Subsequent adjustments to these accrued amounts are recorded in net revenues when known. Franchise Fees The Company franchises a number of its locations under franchise contracts which provide periodic franchise fee payments to the Company and reimbursement for costs and expense related to such franchises. Our franchisees pay us a variety of royalties and fees, including an agreed upon percentage of gross revenues (as defined in the franchise agreement). The Company estimates the amount of franchise fee revenue expected to be earned, if any, during the annual contract period and revenue is recognized as services are provided. The Company's estimate of the transaction price for the franchise services also includes the amount of reimbursement due from the franchises for services provided and related costs incurred. Such revenue is included in "revenues" on the consolidated statements of operations. The related costs are included in "operating expenses" on the consolidated statements of operations. Income Taxes The provision for income taxes is the total of the current taxes payable and the net of the change in the deferred income taxes. Provision is made for the deferred income taxes where differences exist between the period in which transactions affect current taxable income and the period in which they enter into the determination of net income in the financial statements. Leases In December 2018, the FASB issued ASC 842 and as ASU 2016-02, is the new lease accounting standard published by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB). It replaced the previous US GAAP leasing standard, ASC 840. The purpose of the new standard is to close a major accounting loophole in ASC 840: off-balance sheet operating leases. Public companies began to implement the standard starting after December 15, 2018. Private companies will follow a year later on December 15, 2020. ASC 842 represents a significant overhaul of the accounting treatment for leases, with the most significant change being that most leases, including most operating leases, are now capitalized on the balance sheet. Under ASC 840, FASB permitted operating leases to be reported only in the footnotes of corporate financial statements. Under ASC 842, the only leases that are exempt from the capitalization requirement are short-term leases less than or equal to 12 months in length. This became effective December 1, 2019 and the Company chose to adopt it early on December 1, 2018. The adoption did not have any material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements as the Company has no long term leases. Fair value of financial instruments The Company s financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents, accounts payable, accrued liabilities, and debt. Derivative liabilities were adjusted to fair market value at the end of each reporting period, using Level 3 inputs. Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability, in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Valuation techniques used to measure fair value must maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. The fair value hierarchy is based on three levels of inputs, of which the first two are considered observable and the last unobservable, as follows: Level 1 Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 Inputs other than Level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. Level 3 Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the measurement of the fair value of the assets or liabilities. 22 Table of Contents The carrying amounts of the Company s financial assets and liabilities, such as cash, accounts payable and accrued expenses, accrued interest, certain notes payable and notes payable due to related parties, approximate their fair values because of the short maturity of these instruments. The Company accounts for its derivative liabilities, at fair value, on a recurring basis under Level 3 (See Note 6). Embedded Conversion Features The Company evaluates embedded conversion features within convertible debt under Accounting Standards Codification ASC 815 Derivatives and Hedging to determine whether the embedded conversion feature(s) should be bifurcated from the host instrument and accounted for as a derivative at fair value with changes recorded in earnings. If the conversion feature does not require derivative treatment under ASC 815, the instrument is evaluated under ASC 470-20 Debt with Conversion and Other Options for consideration of any beneficial feature. Derivative Financial Instruments When the Company issues debt that contains a conversion feature, it first evaluates whether the conversion feature meets the requirements to be treated as a derivative: a) one or more underlying, typically the price of the Company s stock; b) one or more notional amounts or payment provisions or both, generally the number of shares upon conversion; c) no initial net investment, which typically excludes the amount borrowed; and d) net settlement provisions, which in the case of convertible debt generally means the stock received upon conversion can be readily sold for cash. There are certain scope exceptions from derivative treatment, but these typically exclude conversion features that provide for a variable number of shares. If the conversion feature within convertible debt meet the requirements to be treated as a derivative, the Company estimates the fair value of the derivative liability using the Monte Carlo Simulation Model upon the date of issuance. If the fair value of the derivative liability is higher than the face value of the convertible debt, the excess is immediately recognized as interest expense. Otherwise, the fair value of the derivative liability is recorded as a liability with an offsetting amount recorded as a debt discount, which offsets the carrying amount of the debt. The derivative liability is revalued at the end of each reporting period and any change in fair value is recorded as a change in fair value in the statements of operations. The debt discount is amortized through interest expense over the life of the debt. Derivative instrument liabilities and the host debt agreement are classified on the balance sheets as current or non-current based on whether settlement of the derivative instrument could be required within twelve months of the balance sheet date. The accounting treatment of derivative financial instruments requires that the Company record the embedded conversion option at their fair values as of the inception date of the agreement and at fair value as of each subsequent balance sheet date. Any change in fair value is recorded as non-operating, non-cash income or expense for each reporting period at each balance sheet date. The Company reassesses the classification of its derivative instruments at each balance sheet date. If the classification changes as a result of events during the period, the contract is reclassified as of the date of the event that caused the reclassification. As a result of entering into warrant agreements, for which such instruments contained a variable conversion feature with no floor, the Company has adopted a sequencing policy in accordance with ASC 815-40-35-12 Derivatives and Hedging (provides comprehensive guidance on derivative and hedging transactions) whereby all future instruments may be classified as a derivative liability with the exception of instruments related to share-based compensation issued to employees or directors. Debt Issue Costs and Debt Discount The Company may record debt issue costs and/or debt discounts in connection with raising funds through the issuance of debt. These costs may be paid in the form of cash, or equity (such as warrants). These costs are amortized to interest expense over the life of the debt. If a conversion of the underlying debt occurs, a proportionate share of the unamortized amounts is immediately expensed. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements As of and for the year ended June 30, 2021, the Company does not expect any of the recently issued accounting pronouncements to have a material impact on its financial condition or results of operations. Seasonality We do not expect our sales to be impacted by seasonal demands for our products and services. Item 7A.

Opinion on the Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Innovative MedTech, Inc. (the Company) as of June 30, 2021 and 2020, and the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in stockholders equity and cash flows for the years then ended, and the related notes and schedules (collectively referred to as the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of June 30, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended June 30, 2021, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit Matters The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. Derivatives As described in Note 3 to the Company s consolidated financial statements, when the Company issues debt that contains a conversion feature, it first evaluates whether the conversion feature meets the requirements to be treated as a derivative. If the conversion feature within convertible debt meets the requirements to be treated as a derivative, the Company estimates and records the fair value of the derivative liability using the Monte Carlo Simulation Model upon the date of issuance. The derivative liability is revalued at the end of each reporting period. F-1 Table of Contents We identified the Company s application of the accounting for convertible notes as a critical audit matter. The principal considerations for our determination of this critical audit matter related to the high degree of subjectivity in the Company s judgments in determining the qualitative factors. Auditing these judgments and assumptions by the Company involves auditor judgment due to the nature and extent of audit evidence and effort required to address these matters. The primary procedures we performed to address these critical audit matters included the following: We obtained debt and warrant related agreements and performed the following procedures: - Reviewed agreements for all relevant terms. - Tested management s identification and treatment of agreement terms. - Recalculated management s fair value of each conversion feature based on the terms in the agreements. - Assessed the terms and evaluated the appropriateness of management s application of their accounting policies, along with their use of estimates, in the determination of the amortization of the debt discount. - Reviewed the work of the Company s specialist to calculate the fair value of the derivative liability using the Monte Carlo method to determine whether the derivative liability recorded by the Company was reasonable. Business Acquisition As described in Note 4 to the Company s consolidated financial statements, the Company acquired two companies during the year. The Company accounted for the acquisition in accordance with ASC 805, Business Combinations . We identified the Company s accounting for the business acquisitions as a critical audit matter. The principal considerations for our determination of this critical audit matter related to the high degree of subjectivity in the Company s judgments in determining the qualitative factors. Auditing these judgments and assumptions by the Company involves auditor judgment due to the nature and extent of audit evidence and effort required to address these matters. The primary procedures we performed to address these critical audit matters included the following: We obtained the acquisition agreements and performed the following procedures: - Reviewed agreements for all relevant terms, consideration and other relevant information. - Tested supporting documentation related to the acquired companies in determining the identifiable assets and liabilities. - Reviewed the guidance related to ASC 805 to determine the acquisitions were appropriately accounted for by the Company. Substantial Doubt about the Company s ability to Continue as a Going Concern The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 2, the Company has incurred net losses and has no revenues. These factors, and the need for additional financing in order for the Company to meet its business plans raises substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. Our opinion is not modified with respect to that matter. /s/ Accell Audit Compliance, P.A. We have served as the Company s auditor since 2011.

GENERAL ORGANIZATION AND BUSINESS Innovative MedTech, Inc. (the Company ), a Delaware corporation, is a provider of health and wellness services. On February 1, 2021, the Company filed all required Form 10-Q s and 10-K s to be up to date with its filings before filing its Form 15-12G on November 7, 2014. On February 11, 2021, the Company filed with FINRA to effectuate a 10,000:1 reverse stock split, change its name from Fresh Harvest Products, Inc. to Innovative MedTech, Inc. and change its stock symbol from FRHV to IMTH . FINRA permitted these corporate actions on March 8, 2021. The 10,000:1 reverse split and the name change from Fresh Harvest Products, Inc., to Innovative MedTech, Inc. corporate actions took effect at the open of business on March 9, 2021. On March 25, 2021 the Company acquired two companies, Sarah Adult Day Services, Inc., and Sarah Day Care Centers, Inc.( SarahCare ), an adult day care center franchisor and provider, for a total of 3,718,833; 2,000,110 was paid in cash and the Company assumed approximately 393,885 in debt due to sellers, and the remaining is payable through a royalty fee liability due in the amount of 1,500,000.. With 26 centers (2 corporate and 26 franchise locations) located in 13 states, SarahCare offers seniors daytime care and activities ranging from meeting their physical and medical needs, on a daily basis, ranging from nursing care to salon services and providing meals, to offering engaging and enriching activities to allow them to continue to lead active and engaged lives. On March 25, 2021 the Company received a 2 million investment in the form of a private investment in public equity PIPE from several investors. For the 2 million PIPE, the investors received a combination of common stock and Series A Preferred Stock which together constitute ownership of 84.11 of the Company, 83.00 on a fully diluted basis. The Company continues to have limited capital resources and has experienced net losses and negative cash flows from operations and expects these conditions to continue for the foreseeable future. As of June 30, 2021, the Company had 433,435 cash available for operations and had an accumulated deficit of 14,102,688. Management believes that cash on hand as of June 30, 2021 is not sufficient to fund operations through December 31, 2021. The Company will be required to raise additional funds to meet its short and long-term planned goals. There can be no assurance that such funds, if available at all, can be obtained on terms reasonable to the Company. NOTE 2. LIQUIDITY, CAPITAL RESOURCES AND GOING CONCERN The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going-concern basis, which contemplates the continuation of operations, realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the ordinary course of business. For the years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, the Company reported a net loss of 3,264,957 and 489,695, respectively. As of June 30, 2021, the Company maintained total assets of 5,243,884, total liabilities including long-term debt of 5,299,329 along with an accumulated deficit of 14,916,012. The Company believes that additional capital will be required to fund operations through June 30, 2022 and beyond, as it attempts to generate increasing revenue, and develop new products. The Company intends to attempt to raise capital through additional equity offerings and debt obligations. There can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in obtaining financing at the level needed or on terms acceptable to the Company. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying annual financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. NOTE 3. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Basis of Presentation The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles GAAP and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC and reflect all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, which management believes are necessary to fairly present the financial position, results of operations and cash flows of the Company as of and for the years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020. Principles of Consolidation We have two wholly-owned subsidiaries; Sarah Adult Day Services, Inc., and Sarah Day Care Centers, Inc. The consolidated financial statements, which include the accounts of the Company and its two wholly-owned subsidiaries, are prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America U.S. GAAP ). All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. The consolidated financial statements, which include the accounts of the Company and its eight wholly-owned subsidiaries, and related disclosures have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC ). The Financial Statements have been prepared using the accrual basis of accounting in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America GAAP and presented in US dollars. The fiscal year end is June 30. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Because of the use of estimates inherent in the financial reporting process, actual results may differ significantly from those estimates. F-7 Table of Contents Cash and Cash Equivalents The Company maintains cash balances in a non-interest-bearing account that currently does not exceed over 250,000 at June 30, 2021. For the purpose of the consolidated statements, all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less are considered to be cash equivalents. There were no cash equivalents as of June 30, 2021 and 2020. Earnings Per Share Calculation Basic earnings per common share EPS is computed by dividing income available to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average shares outstanding, assuming all dilutive potential common shares were issued. Revenue Recognition Revenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services. In addition, the standard requires disclosure of the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. The amount of revenue that is recorded reflects the consideration that the Company expects to receive in exchange for those goods. The Company applies the following five-step model in order to determine this amount: (i) identification of the promised goods in the contract; (ii) determination of whether the promised goods are performance obligations, including whether they are distinct in the context of the contract; (iii) measurement of the transaction price, including the constraint on variable consideration; (iv) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations; and (v) recognition of revenue when (or as) the Company satisfies each performance obligation. The Company only applies the five-step model to contracts when it is probable that the entity will collect the consideration it is entitled to in exchange for the goods or services it transfers to the customer. Once a contract is determined to be within the scope of Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB Accounting Standards Codification ASC 606 at contract inception, the Company reviews the contract to determine which performance obligations the Company must deliver and which of these performance obligations are distinct. Participant Fees Resident fee revenue is reported at the amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for the services provided. These amounts are due from participants or third-party payors and include variable consideration for retroactive adjustments from estimated reimbursements, if any, under reimbursement programs. Performance obligations are determined based on the nature of the services provided. Resident fee revenue is recognized as performance obligations are satisfied. Under the Company's day care agreements, which are generally for a contractual term of 30 days to one year, the Company provides services to participants for a stated daily or monthly fee. The Company has elected the lessor practical expedient within ASC 842, Leases ("ASC 842") and recognizes, measures, presents, and discloses the revenue for services under the Company's senior living residency agreements based upon the predominant component, either the lease or nonlease component, of the contracts. The Company has determined that the services included under the Company's independent living, assisted living, and memory care residency agreements have the same timing and pattern of transfer and are performance obligations that are satisfied over time. The Company recognizes revenue under ASC 606, Revenue Recognition from Contracts with Customers ("ASC 606") for its participants agreements for which it has estimated that the nonlease components of such agreements are the predominant component of the contract. The Company enters into contracts to provide home assisted health, and certain outpatient services. Each service provided under the contract is capable of being distinct, and thus, the services are considered individual and separate performance obligations. The performance obligations are satisfied as services are provided and revenue is recognized as services are provided. The Company receives payment for services under various third-party payor programs which include Medicaid, Veterans Affairs and other third-party payors. Estimates for settlements with third-party payors for retroactive adjustments from estimated reimbursements due to audits, reviews, or investigations are included in the determination of the estimated transaction price for providing services. The Company estimates the transaction price based on the terms of the contract with the payor, correspondence with the payor, and historical payment trends. Changes to these estimates for retroactive adjustments are recognized in the period the change or adjustment becomes known or when final settlements are determined. Billings for services under third-party payor programs are recorded net of estimated retroactive adjustments, if any. Retroactive adjustments are accrued on an estimated basis in the period the related services are rendered and adjusted in future periods or as final settlements are determined. Contractual or cost related adjustments from Medicaid or Veterans Affairs are accrued when assessed (without regard to when the assessment is paid or withheld). Subsequent adjustments to these accrued amounts are recorded in net revenues when known. Franchise Fees The Company franchises a number of its locations under franchise contracts which provide periodic franchise fee payments to the Company and reimbursement for costs and expense related to such franchises. Our franchisees pay us a variety of royalties and fees, including an agreed upon percentage of gross revenues (as defined in the franchise agreement). The Company estimates the amount of franchise fee revenue expected to be earned, if any, during the annual contract period and revenue is recognized as services are provided. The Company's estimate of the transaction price for the franchise services also includes the amount of reimbursement due from the franchises for services provided and related costs incurred. Such revenue is included in "revenues" on the consolidated statements of operations. The related costs are included in "operating expenses" on the consolidated statements of operations. Income Taxes The provision for income taxes is the total of the current taxes payable and the net of the change in the deferred income taxes. Provision is made for the deferred income taxes where differences exist between the period in which transactions affect current taxable income and the period in which they enter into the determination of net income in the financial statements. F-8 Table of Contents Leases In December 2018, the FASB issued ASC 842 and as ASU 2016-02, is the new lease accounting standard published by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB). It replaced the previous US GAAP leasing standard, ASC 840. The purpose of the new standard is to close a major accounting loophole in ASC 840: off-balance sheet operating leases. Public companies began to implement the standard starting after December 15, 2018. Private companies will follow a year later on December 15, 2020. ASC 842 represents a significant overhaul of the accounting treatment for leases, with the most significant change being that most leases, including most operating leases, are now capitalized on the balance sheet. Under ASC 840, FASB permitted operating leases to be reported only in the footnotes of corporate financial statements. Under ASC 842, the only leases that are exempt from the capitalization requirement are short-term leases less than or equal to 12 months in length. This became effective December 1, 2019 and the Company chose to adopt it early on December 1, 2018. The adoption did not have any material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements as the Company has no long term leases. Fair value of financial instruments The Company s financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents, accounts payable, accrued liabilities, and debt. The carrying value of these financial instruments is considered to be representative of their fair value due to the short maturity of these instruments. The carrying amount of the debt approximates fair value, because the interest rates on these instruments approximate the interest rate on debt with similar terms available to the Company. The Company s derivative liabilities were adjusted to fair market value at the end of each reporting period, using Level 3 inputs. Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability, in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Valuation techniques used to measure fair value must maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. The fair value hierarchy is based on three levels of inputs, of which the first two are considered observable and the last unobservable, as follows: Level 1 Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 Inputs other than Level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. Level 3 Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the measurement of the fair value of the assets or liabilities. The carrying amounts of the Company s financial assets and liabilities, such as cash, accounts payable, accrued expenses and interest, certain notes payable and notes payable due to related parties, approximate their fair values because of the short maturity of these instruments. The Company accounts for its derivative liabilities, at fair value, on a recurring basis under Level 3 (See Note 11). Embedded Conversion Features The Company evaluates embedded conversion features within convertible debt under Accounting Standards Codification ASC 815 Derivatives and Hedging to determine whether the embedded conversion feature(s) should be bifurcated from the host instrument and accounted for as a derivative at fair value with changes recorded in earnings. If the conversion feature does not require derivative treatment under ASC 815, the instrument is evaluated under ASC 470-20 Debt with Conversion and Other Options for consideration of any beneficial feature. Derivative financial instruments When the Company issues debt that contains a conversion feature, it first evaluates whether the conversion feature meets the requirements to be treated as a derivative: a) one or more underlying, typically the price of the Company s stock; b) one or more notional amounts or payment provisions or both, generally the number of shares upon conversion; c) no initial net investment, which typically excludes the amount borrowed; and d) net settlement provisions, which in the case of convertible debt generally means the stock received upon conversion can be readily sold for cash. There are certain scope exceptions from derivative treatment, but these typically exclude conversion features that provide for a variable number of shares. If the conversion features within convertible debt meet the requirements to be treated as a derivative, the Company estimates the fair value of the derivative liability using the Monte Carlo Simulation Model upon the date of issuance. If the fair value of the derivative liability is higher than the face value of the convertible debt, the excess is immediately recognized as interest expense. Otherwise, the fair value of the derivative liability is recorded as a liability with an offsetting amount recorded as a debt discount, which offsets the carrying amount of the debt. The derivative liability is revalued at the end of each reporting period and any change in fair value is recorded as a change in fair value in the statements of operations. The debt discount is amortized through interest expense over the life of the debt. Derivative instrument liabilities and the host debt agreement are classified on the balance sheets as current or non-current based on whether settlement of the derivative instrument could be required within twelve months of the balance sheet date. The accounting treatment of derivative financial instruments requires that the Company record the embedded conversion option at their fair values as of the inception date of the agreement and at fair value as of each subsequent balance sheet date. Any change in fair value is recorded as non-operating, non-cash income or expense for each reporting period at each balance sheet date. The Company reassesses the classification of its derivative instruments at each balance sheet date. If the classification changes as a result of events during the period, the contract is reclassified as of the date of the event that caused the reclassification. As a result of entering into warrant agreements, for which such instruments contained a variable conversion feature with no floor, the Company has adopted a sequencing policy in accordance with ASC 815-40-35-12 Derivatives and Hedging (provides comprehensive guidance on derivative and hedging transactions) whereby all future instruments may be classified as a derivative liability with the exception of instruments related to share-based compensation issued to employees or directors. Debt Issue Costs and Debt Discount The Company may record debt issue costs and/or debt discounts in connection with raising funds through the issuance of debt. These costs may be paid in the form of cash, or equity (such as warrants). These costs are amortized to interest expense over the life of the debt. If a conversion of the underlying debt occurs, a proportionate share of the unamortized amounts is immediately expensed. F-9 Table of Contents Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements As of and for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021, the Company does not expect any of the recently issued accounting pronouncements to have a material impact on its financial condition or results of operations. Subsequent Events In accordance with ASC 855, Subsequent Events , the Company evaluated subsequent events through the date of this report; the date the consolidated financial statements were available for issue. NOTE 4. BUSINESS ACQUISITION On March 25, 2021 the Company acquired two companies, Sarah Adult Day Services, Inc., and Sarah Day Care Centers, Inc. SarahCare ), an adult day care center franchisor and provider. The combined purchase price was 3,718,833. The purchase price was paid as follows: (i) 2,000,110 was paid in cash, (ii) the Company assumed 393,885 in debt due to sellers, and (iii) the remaining is payable through a royalty fee liability due in the amount of 1,500,000.

The initial accounting for the business combination is not completed and the fair value of the acquired identifiable intangible assets are provisional pending receipt of the final valuations for those assets. The Company performed a test to determine if goodwill should be impaired. The test determined that the fair value of the reporting units was less than its carrying value. As such the Company recorded a loss on impairment of goodwill in the amount of 806,690.

NOTES PAYABLE, LONG TERM PPP Loans The Company received loan proceeds in the amount of approximately 168,520 through Sarah Adult Days Services, Inc. and 270,640 through Sarah Day Care Centers, Inc. under the Paycheck Protection Program PPP prior to the March 25, 2021 acquisition. The PPP, established as part of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act CARES Act ), provides for loans to qualifying businesses for amounts up to 2.5 times of the average monthly payroll expenses of the qualifying business. The loans and accrued interest are forgivable after twenty-four weeks as long as the borrower uses the loan proceeds for eligible purposes, including payroll, benefits, rent and utilities, and maintains its payroll levels. The amount of loan forgiveness will be reduced if the borrower terminates employees or reduces salaries during the period. The unforgiven portion of the PPP loan is payable over five years at an interest rate of 1 , with a deferral of payments for the first twelve months. The Company was granted forgiveness of 89,920 in PPP loans through Sarah Day Care Centers, Inc. and 82,600 through Sarah Adult Days Services, Inc. As a result, the Company recorded a gain on PPP forgiveness in the amount of 172,520. The Company is currently in the process of applying for forgiveness for the remaining balance of 266,640 but cannot be assured of forgiveness for all or part of the PPP borrowings. During the year ended June 30, 2021, the Company recorded 855 in accrued interest related to the PPP loan. SBA Loan On June 20, 2020, the Company s wholly-owned subsidiary, Sarah Day Care Centers, Inc. received proceeds of 150,000 in the form of an SBA loan. Installment payments, including principal and interest of 731 are due monthly beginning on June 20, 2021. The balance of principal and interest is payable thirty years from the promissory note date. The interest accrues at a rate of 3.75 per annum. During the year ended June 30, 2021, the Company recorded 5,779 in accrued interest related to the SBA loan. NOTE 11. DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS The following tables summarize the components of the Company s derivative liabilities and linked common shares as of June 30, 2021 and June 30, 2020 and the amounts that were reflected in income related to derivatives for the years then ended: June 30, 2021 The financings giving rise to derivative financial instruments Indexed Fair Shares Values Compound embedded derivative 405,106 (254,700 F-14 Table of Contents June 30, 2020 The financings giving rise to derivative financial instruments Indexed Fair Shares Values Compound embedded derivative 3,764,003,526 (257,493 The following tables summarizes the effects on the Company s gain (loss) associated with changes in the fair values of the derivative financial instruments by type of financing for the years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020: The financings giving rise to derivative financial instruments and the income effects: Years Ended June 30, 2021 June 30, 2020 Compound embedded derivative (223,264 97,024 Day one derivative loss - - Total derivative gain (loss) (223,264 97,024 The Company s Convertible Notes gave rise to derivative financial instruments. The Notes embodied certain terms and conditions that were not clearly and closely related to the host debt agreement in terms of economic risks and characteristics. These terms and features consist of the embedded conversion option. Current accounting principles that are provided in ASC 815 - Derivatives and Hedging require derivative financial instruments to be classified in liabilities and carried at fair value with changes recorded in income. In addition, the standards do not permit an issuer to account separately for individual derivative terms and features embedded in hybrid financial instruments that require bifurcation and liability classification as derivative financial instruments. Rather, such terms and features must be bundled together and fair valued as a single, compound embedded derivative. The Company has selected the Monte Carlo Simulations valuation technique to fair value the compound embedded derivative because it believes that this technique is reflective of all significant assumption types, and ranges of assumption inputs, that market participants would likely consider in transactions involving compound embedded derivatives. Such assumptions include, among other inputs, interest risk assumptions, credit risk assumptions and redemption behaviors in addition to traditional inputs for option models such as market trading volatility and risk-free rates. The Monte Carlo Simulations technique is a level three valuation technique because it requires the development of significant internal assumptions in addition to observable market indicators. Significant inputs and results arising from the Monte Carlo Simulations process are as follows for the compound embedded derivative that has been bifurcated from the Convertible Notes and classified in liabilities: June 30, June 30, Inception 2021 2020 Quoted market price on valuation date 0.01 1.35 0.0002 Contractual conversion rate 0.0054 - 0.0081 0.88 - 1.08 0.00010 - 0.00016 Range of effective contractual conversion rates -- -- -- Contractual term to maturity 1.00 Year 0.23 Years 0.25 Years Market volatility: Volatility 138.28 -238.13 187.33 138.28 -238.13 Contractual interest rate 5 -12 5 -12 5 -12 F-15 Table of Contents The following table reflects the issuances of compound embedded derivatives and changes in fair value inputs and assumptions related to the compound embedded derivatives during the years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020.

Except as provided by law or by the other provisions of the Parent Company s Certificate of Incorporation, holders of Preferred Stock vote together with the holders of common stock as a single class. NOTE 13. PROVISION FOR CORPORATE INCOME TAXES The Company provides for income taxes by the use of an asset and liability approach in accounting for income taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded based on the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities and the tax rates in effect when these differences are expected to reverse. This also requires the reduction of deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. F-17 Table of Contents The valuation allowance at June 30, 2021 was 2,792,070 and as of June 30, 2020 was 2,277,227. The net change in allowance during the year ended June 30, 2021 was 514,843. As of June 30, 2021, the Company has federal net operating loss carry forwards of approximately 13,296,000 available to offset future taxable income through 2040. The Company may be able to utilize its NOLs to reduce future federal and state income tax liabilities. However, these NOLs are subject to various limitations under Internal Revenue Code IRC Section 382. IRC Section 382 limits the use of NOLs to the extent there has been an ownership change of more than 50 percentage points. In addition, the NOL carry-forwards are subject to examination by the taxing authority and could be adjusted or disallowed due to such exams. Although the Company has not undergone an IRC Section 382 analysis, it is possible that the utilization of the NOLs could be substantially limited. The Company has no tax provision for the years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020 due to losses and full valuation allowances against net deferred tax assets. As of June 30, 2021 and 2020, the difference between the tax provision at the statutory federal income tax rate and the tax provision attributable to loss before income taxes is as follows (in percentages): Statutory federal income tax rate (21 State taxes net of federal benefits (5 Valuation allowance 26 Income tax rate net 0 FASB Interpretation No. 48 (Fin 48) - Accounting for Uncertain Tax Positions The Company files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various state, and local jurisdictions. The Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal income tax examination by tax authorities, with limited exception, for the years prior to June 30, 2014. With respect to state and local jurisdictions, with limited exception, the Company is no longer subject to income tax audits prior to June 30, 2014. In the normal course of business, the Company is subject to examination by various taxing authorities. Although the outcome of tax audits is always uncertain, the Company believes that adequate amounts of tax, interest and penalties have been provided for any adjustments that may result from these open tax years. Based on management s review of the Company s tax position, the Company had no significant unrecognized corporate tax liabilities as of June 30, 2021 and 2020 payable to the Internal Revenue Service due to the net operating loss carry-forward, however, the Company had yet to file its 2005 through 2009 and 2012 through 2020 Federal, New Jersey nor New York Corporate Income Tax Returns. NOTE 14. UNPAID PAYROLL TAXES As of June 30, 2021 and 2020, the Company owed the Internal Revenue Service and New York State payroll related taxes in the amounts of 60,402 and 17,401, respectively, subject to further interest and penalties. The total amount due to both taxing authorities including penalties and interest as of June 30, 2021 and 2020 was approximately 77,803 subject to further penalties and interest. This is included in the 775,969 of accounts payable on the Company s balance sheet. NOTE 15.

Operating lease right-of-use asset and liability are recognized at the present value of the future lease payments at the lease commencement date. The interest rate used to determine the present value is our incremental borrowing rate, estimated to be 10 , as the interest rate implicit in most of the Company s leases is not readily determinable. Operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Since the common area maintenance expenses are expenses that do not depend on an index or rate, they are excluded from the measurement of the lease liability and recognized in general and administrative expenses on the consolidated statements of operations.

SUBSEQUENT EVENTS The Company has evaluated subsequent events for recognition and disclosure through October 13, 2021, the date the financial statements were available to be issued, and determined that there were no such events requiring adjustment to, or disclosure in, the accompanying consolidated financial statements. F-20 Table of Contents Item 9. Changes In and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure We have had no disagreements with our accountants required to be disclosed pursuant to Item 304 of Regulation S-K. Item 9A. Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures The Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have evaluated the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the year ended June 30, 2021, covered by this Form 10-K. Based upon such evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of the end of such period, the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as required under Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act. Management s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting The management of the Company is responsible for the preparation of the financial statements and related financial information appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The financial statements and notes have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The management of the Company is also responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. A company s internal control over financial reporting is defined as a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the issuer are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and the board of directors of the Company; and Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial officer, does not expect that the Company s disclosure controls and internal controls will prevent all error and all fraud. Because of its inherent limitations, a system of internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met and may not prevent or detect misstatements. Further, over time, control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. With the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, our management evaluated the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2021, based upon the framework in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in 2013. Based on that evaluation, our management has concluded that, as of June 30, 2021, the Company had material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting and the Company s internal control over financial reporting were not effective. Specifically, management identified the following material weaknesses at June 30, 2021: 1. Lack of oversight by independent directors in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures; 2. Lack of functioning audit committee, resulting in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures; 3. Insufficient personnel resources within the accounting function to segregate the duties over financial transaction processing and reporting and to allow for proper monitoring controls over accounting; 4. Insufficient written policies and procedures over accounting transaction processing and period end financial disclosure and reporting processes. 25 Table of Contents To remediate our internal control weaknesses, management intends to implement the following measures: The Company will add sufficient number of independent directors to the board and appoint an audit committee. The Company will add sufficient knowledgeable accounting personnel to properly segregate duties and to effect a timely, accurate preparation of the financial statements. Upon the hiring of additional accounting personnel, the Company will develop and maintain adequate written accounting policies and procedures. The additional hiring is contingent upon the Company s efforts to obtain additional funding through equity or debt for its continued operational activities and corporate expenses. Management provides no assurances that it will be able to do so. We understand that remediation of material weaknesses and deficiencies in internal controls are a continuing work in progress due to the issuance of new standards and promulgations. However, remediation of any known deficiency is among our highest priorities. Our management will periodically assess the progress and sufficiency of our ongoing initiatives and make adjustments as and when necessary. As a smaller reporting company, we are not required to provide, and this annual report does not include, an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting Except as set forth above, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the period covered by this report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls The Company s management, including the CEO and CFO, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system s objectives will be met. Further, the design of the control system must reflect that there are resource constraints and that the benefits must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of controls. The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Projections of any evaluation of controls effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures. Item 9B. Other Information.

Any action required can be taken at any annual or special meeting of stockholders of the corporation which may be taken without a meeting, without prior notice and without a vote, if consent of consents in writing setting forth the action so taken, shall be signed by the holders of the outstanding stock having not less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take such action at a meeting at which all shares entitled to vote thereon were present and voted and shall be delivered to the corporation by delivery to its registered office, its principle place of business, or an officer or agent of the corporation having custody of the book in which the proceedings of meetings are recorded. 27 Table of Contents Indemnification of Directors and Officers Pursuant to Section 145 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, we have the power to indemnify any person made a party to any lawsuit by reason of being a director or officer of the Company, or serving at the request of the corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against expenses (including attorneys fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection with such action, suit or proceeding if he acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful. Our articles of incorporation provide that the Company shall indemnify its directors and officers to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law. Insofar as indemnification by us for liabilities arising under the Securities Act may be permitted to our directors, officers or persons controlling the company pursuant to provisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws, or otherwise, we have been advised that in the opinion of the SEC, such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and is therefore unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification by such director, officer or controlling person of us in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding is asserted by such director, officer or controlling person in connection with the securities being offered, we will, unless in the opinion of our counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by us is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue. Director Compensation During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, we did not have an independent director.

(4) Resigned from the Board of Directors on March 25, 2021. 28 Table of Contents Involvement on Certain Material Legal Proceedings During the Last Five Years None of our Officers and/or Directors have filed any bankruptcy petition, been convicted of or been the subject of any criminal proceedings or the subject of any order, judgment or decree involving the violation of any state or federal securities laws within the past ten (10) years. No director, nominee for director, or executive officer has appeared as a party in any legal proceeding material to an evaluation of his ability or integrity during the past ten (10) years. Directors and Officers Liability Insurance The Company does not have directors and officers liability insurance insuring our directors and officers against liability for acts or omissions in their capacities as directors or officers. Code of Ethics We intend to adopt a code of ethics that applies to our officers, directors and employees, including our principal executive officer and principal accounting officer, but have not done so to date due to our relatively small size. We intend to adopt a written code of ethics in the near future. Corporate Governance and Board Independence Our Board of Directors consists of two directors and has not established a Nominating or Governance Committees as standing committees. The Board does not have an executive committee or any committees performing a similar function. We are not currently listed on a national securities exchange or in an inter-dealer quotation system that has requirements that a majority of the board of directors be independent. Due to our lack of operations and size, and since we are not currently listed on a national securities exchange, we are not subject to any listing requirements mandating the establishment of any particular committees; all functions of a nominating/governance committee were performed by our whole board of directors. Our board of directors intends to appoint such persons and form such committees as are required to meet the corporate governance requirements imposed by the national securities exchanges as necessary. Our board of directors does not believe that it is necessary to have such committees at the early stage of the company s development, and our board of directors believes that the functions of such committees can be adequately performed by the members of our board of directors. We believe that our board of directors is capable of analyzing and evaluating our financial statements and understanding internal controls and procedures for financial reporting. We believe that retaining an independent director who would qualify as an audit committee financial expert would be overly costly and burdensome and is not warranted in our circumstances given the early stages of our development and the fact that we have not generated any material revenues to date. Board Leadership Structure and the Board s Role in Risk Oversight. The Board of Directors is led by our Chairman. At this time, the Board believes that the most effective leadership structure at this time is to separate the roles of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. The Board of Directors does not have a specific role in risk oversight of the Company. The President and Chief Executive Officer and other executive officers and employees of the Company provide the Board of Directors with information regarding the Company s risks. 29 Table of Contents Item 11. Executive Compensation The following table sets forth, for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2021, 2020 and 2019, certain information regarding the compensation earned by the Company s named executive officers.

The Company does not have a defined benefit, pension plan, profit sharing or other retirement plan, although it may adopt one or more of such plans in the future. Executive Compensation .
