Summary
of Material Risks Associated with Our Business 

Our
business is subject to a number of risks that if realized could materially affect our business, prospects, operating results and financial
condition. These risks are discussed more fully in the Risk Factors section of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-K. These
risks include the following: 

We
 have a history of losses, and we may not achieve or maintain profitability. 

The
 currently evolving situation related to the COVID-19 pandemic could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results
 of operations. 

Raising
 additional funds by issuing securities or through collaboration and licensing arrangements may cause dilution to existing stockholders,
 restrict our operations or require us to relinquish proprietary rights. 

We
 need to continue to increase customer awareness and adoption of our food safety product offerings, PURE Hard Surface and PURE Control. 

We
 may not be able to correctly estimate our future revenues and operating expenses, which could lead to cash shortfalls, and require
 us to secure additional financing sooner than planned. 

Our
 quarterly operating results may vary, which could negatively affect the market price of our common stock. 

If
 we are unable to obtain the required regulatory approvals from the FDA and USDA, or if such efforts are delayed, our ability to commercialize
 PURE Control as a direct food contact processing aid will be harmed and our business and operating results will suffer. 

A
 loss of one or more of our key customers could adversely affect our business. 

We
 are dependent on our core SDC technology and if our efforts to achieve or maintain market acceptance of our core SDC technology are
 not successful, we are unlikely to continue to maintain profitability. 

We
 are subject to intense competition in the food safety market. 

We
 have limited sales, marketing and product distribution experience. 

We
 are dependent on a third-party, over whom we have limited control, to manufacture our SDC-based products. 

We
 rely on third parties to develop SDC-based products, and they may not do so successfully or diligently. 

We
 are subject to substantial regulation related to quality standards applicable to our manufacturing and quality processes, and our
 partners, including our third-party manufacturer, failure to comply with applicable quality standards could affect our ability to
 commercialize SDC products. 

The
 industries in which we operate are heavily regulated. 

If
 we are unable to obtain, maintain or defend the patent and other intellectual property rights relating to our technology, we or our
 collaborators and distributors may not be able to develop and market proprietary products based on our technology, which would have
 a material adverse impact on our results of operations.

PART
I 

Item
1. Business 

Overview 

We
are focused on developing and commercializing proprietary antimicrobial products that provide safe and cost-effective solutions to the
health and environmental challenges of pathogen and hygienic control. Our technology platform is based on patented stabilized ionic silver,
and our initial products contain silver dihydrogen citrate, or SDC. SDC is a broad-spectrum, non-toxic antimicrobial agent, which offers
24-hour residual protection and formulates well with other compounds. As a platform technology, we believe SDC is distinguished from
existing products in the marketplace because of its superior efficacy, reduced toxicity, non-causticity and the inability of bacteria
to form a resistance to it. 

We
believe there is a significant market opportunity for our safe, non-toxic, non-caustic and effective SDC-based solutions. We currently
offer PURE Hard Surface as a food contact surface sanitizer and disinfectant to restaurant chains, food processors and
food transportation companies. We also offer PURE Control as a direct food contact processing aid. In addition to our
direct sales efforts with PURE Hard Surface and PURE Control, we market and sell our SDC-based products indirectly through third-party
distributors supporting various industries. 

4 

Technology
Platform 

The
foundation of our technology platform is a proprietary electrochemical process that allows us to generate ionized silver in the presence
of organic acid. This process creates a solution containing stabilized ionic silver that can function as an antimicrobial. Our current
products all contain SDC, which we produce by ionizing silver in citric acid. SDC is a natural, non-toxic, non-caustic, colorless, odorless
antimicrobial agent, which offers 24-hour residual protection, and that formulates well with other compounds. We have also produced ionic
silver-based molecular entities using other organic acids, and we believe these compounds may provide a platform for future product development. 

Silver
as an Antimicrobial 

The
use of silver as an antimicrobial dates back to ancient times when water, wine and other beverages were kept in silver vessels to maintain
freshness. Ancient Egyptians applied thin strips of beaten silver around wounds to avoid infection, and early royalty ate from silver
plates and with silver utensils to stay healthy. In the past half-century, silver in colloidal and ionic forms has been used successfully
in a wide array of antimicrobial applications, including water purification and topical treatments for burn victims. Silver must be in
an ionic form to be effective at killing microorganisms. The short shelf-life of previous ionic silver solutions has limited the development
of ionic-silver based antimicrobials. SDC, as a stabilized silver ion complex, has a shelf life of more than a decade because the weak
bond of the silver ion to the citric acid allows the ion to remain stable in solution while at the same time making it bioavailable for
antimicrobial action. 

Mechanisms
of Action 

The
rapid and broad-spectrum efficacy of SDC is attributed to its dual mechanisms of action, both with respect to killing bacteria and other
microorganisms and acting against viruses. SDC can kill microorganisms at both the extracellular and intracellular levels. SDC attracts
bacteria because the citric acid is recognized by the organism as a food source. SDC easily enters the microorganism through membrane
transport proteins. Once inside the organism, SDC binds to DNA and intracellular proteins causing irreversible damage to the DNA and
protein structure. Metabolic and reproductive functions halt, and the organism dies. SDC can also act on an organism s outer membrane.
Silver ions are highly attracted to sulfur-containing thiol groups found in metabolic and structural proteins bound to the membrane surface.
SDC targets these critical proteins and destroys their structure. This disruption of the organism s membrane function and integrity
leads to its death. 

Viruses
are much smaller than bacteria and present fewer target sites on which a biocide can act. The efficacy of SDC against enveloped and non-enveloped
viruses comes from its ability to destroy not only the viral envelope, preventing the virus from attaching to a host cell, but also the
infectious component of the virus, the nucleic acid. 

Safety
Profile 

Research
has shown that silver is an effective antimicrobial and not toxic to humans at the residual levels following the use of our SDC-based
products. In addition, our data shows the components of SDC, ionic silver and citric acid, to be non-toxic, particularly at the low concentrations
required to eliminate microorganisms. At higher concentrations, citric acid can be an eye irritant. We have tested a concentrated SDC
formulation using standard protocols to measure acute toxicity. Acute oral and dermal toxicity was not observed at doses up to and including
5000 mg/kg. Data from eye and skin studies showed only slight irritation and no dermal sensitization. 

GRAS
Status as Contact Biocide 

A
committee of independent experts critically reviewed efficacy and toxicity data for SDC and the SDC-based PURE Hard Surface disinfectant
and food contact surface sanitizer. The committee found no evidence that SDC demonstrates a hazard to the public when used as a contact
biocide on food contact surfaces and food-use utensils. The committee, therefore, concluded such use to be generally recognized as safe,
consistent with the EPA registration (discussed below), allowing for use on food manufacturing and processing equipment and food preparation
surfaces. 

5 

Efficacy 

Formulations
containing SDC provide complete, quick and broad-spectrum antimicrobial efficacy against gram positive and gram negative bacteria, enveloped
and non-enveloped viruses, and fungi. In addition to quick kill times, SDC provides residual antimicrobial activity. SDC also provides
rapid kill times against multiple drug resistant bacteria, including Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus , or MRSA, Vancomycin
resistant Enterococcus faecium , or VRE, Carbapenem resistant Escherichia coli , Carbapenem resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae
 and Carbapenem resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae, NDM-1+. See EPA Registrations below for more detailed efficacy
data. 

Natural
and Environmentally Responsible 

SDC
is made of simple and all-natural ingredients: water, citric acid and minute amounts of ionic silver. SDC does not present a threat to
the environment. If introduced to water systems, the low concentrations of ionic silver in SDC would react with naturally present substances
such as chlorides, sulfides and organic matter. These reactions would create insoluble silver complexes and render the silver inert.
In addition, we manufacture SDC through a zero waste process in which no byproducts or environmental effluent are created. 

Market
Opportunity 

U.S.
Incidence and Cost of Foodborne Illness 

According
to an Ohio State University study published in the Journal of Food Protection, completed by Dr. Scharff, a consumer science professor,
foodborne illness poses a 77.7 billion economic burden in the United States annually. This cost estimate includes health related costs,
associated medical costs, productivity losses, mortality, and pain and suffering. The study noted that excluding the estimated costs
for pain and suffering, health related costs exceeded 51 billion. The study does not include costs to the food industry, including reduced
consumer confidence, reduced brand value, product recall costs, and litigation, nor does it include the cost to public health agencies
(local, state and federal) that are required to respond to illnesses and outbreaks. In addition, the study cited Salmonella as
the most costly pathogen with an economic burden estimated to be in excess of 11 billion. This is primarily due to its high incidence
and mortality rate. 

Limitations
of Existing Food Safety Solutions 

The
U.S. food industry continues to rely on the use of toxic chemicals as processing aids or interventions during food processing operations
for which pathogens are becoming increasingly resistant and rendering current interventions less efficacious. Most of these chemicals
carry various warning labels for their toxic and/or caustic characteristics, which can negatively affect the safety of processing plant
personnel, plant operating equipment and the plant environment and its surroundings. 

6 

Among
the chemicals in current use are: peracetic acid, acidified sodium chlorite (ASC), ozone, trisodium phosphate, cetylpyridinium chloride
(CPC), organic acid rinses (lactic acid), hypobromous acid and chlorine dioxide. Some of these chemicals can be difficult to work with
as a processing aid as they require heating to become effective or are difficult to mix and stabilize prior to use. Additionally, some
of these chemicals damage the food being processed, resulting in decreased yields. Further, the use of certain of these chemicals is
limited to treating only specific pathogens and/or only certain foods. In addition, some of these chemicals can produce noxious fumes
that over time have been linked to upper respiratory illness and typically require in-plant decontamination of their effluence. 

Several
large and established corporations currently supply these chemicals. They may also provide other related food safety services such as
environmental sanitation programs and food safety consultation and audit services. 

Our
SDC-Based Products as a Food Safety Solution 

Based
on the limitations of the existing food safety solutions, we believe that our SDC-based products, including PURE Hard Surface and PURE
Control, are well positioned as new and disruptive solutions for the food safety industry. Given their broad spectrum antimicrobial efficacy
and non-toxic properties, our SDC-based products provide significant improvements over current chemical interventions that can both strengthen
our customers food safety practices and help them control and eliminate pathogens present during their food processing operations. 

Our
SDC-based products can provide users with the following benefits compared to the current processing chemicals they are using: 

Easier
 to handle and dilute; 

Non-corrosive
 to processing equipment; 

Non-toxic
 to manufacturing personnel by not creating noxious fumes or other detrimental environmental effluence; and 

Neutral
 to positive yield impact on the processed food 

Based
on their performance and characteristics, we believe our SDC-based products can provide our customers with significant advantages to
the chemical interventions they are currently using and help them achieve their goal of improving the safety of processed foods they
offer to consumers.

Business
Strategy 

Our
goal is to become a sustainable company by commercializing the SDC-based products we have developed with our proprietary technology platform.
We are focused on delivering leading antimicrobial products that address food safety risks across the food industry supply chain. Key
aspects of our business strategy include: 

Expanding
 sales and distribution for our products into the food industry with a focus on a dual track of food safety market opportunities:

Hard
 Surface Disinfectant - commercializing our current EPA registered PURE Hard Surface disinfectant and sanitizer for use in
 foodservice operations, food manufacturing and food transportation. 

Direct
 Food Contact - commercializing FDA approved PURE Control as a direct food contact processing aid for fresh produce; commercializing
 FDA approved PURE Control as a food processing and intervention aid for food processors treating raw poultry in pre and post on-line
 reprocessing. 

Continuing
 to grow and establish new strategic alliances to maximize the commercial potential of our technology platform; 

Continuing
 to partner with third parties who are seeking, or intend to seek, approvals to market SDC-based products in markets outside the U.S. 

Developing
 additional proprietary products and applications; and 

Protecting
 and enhancing our intellectual property. 

In
addition to our current products addressing food safety, we intend to leverage our technology platform through licensing and distribution
collaborations in order to develop new products and enter into new markets that could potentially generate multiple sources of revenue. 

Our
Products 

In
addition to PURE Hard Surface and PURE Control, we manufacture and sell (i) SDC-based products for end use, (ii) products preserved with
SDC and (iii) SDC as a raw material ingredient for manufacturing use. Our current products are as follows:

PURE
Control 

We
have the necessary regulatory approvals from the FDA to offer PURE Control as a direct food contact processing aid for fresh produce
and raw poultry. We also have regulatory approvals from the USDA for certain methods of application of PURE Control on poultry. Additionally,
subject to the results of our focused in-plant validation efforts for our approved produce and poultry solutions, we intend to seek approval
to utilize PURE Control as a direct food contact processing aid for raw meats, including beef and pork. 

Poultry
Processing Aid. In May 2017, we received the required approvals from the FDA stating that our food contact notification for SDC
as a raw poultry processing aid is complete. We received a No Objection Letter from the USDA s Food Safety and Inspection
Service (FSIS) granting approval for the higher concentrations of SDC-based PURE Control to be used as a spray or dip applied to poultry
carcasses, parts and organs in pre-OLR (on-line reprocessing) and post chill processing of fresh poultry. 

Produce
Processing Aid . In January 2016, we received the required approvals from the FDA stating that our FCN for SDC as a spray or dip
on processed fruits and vegetables is complete. We were not required to obtain any approvals from the USDA to market PURE Control as
a produce processing aid. 

Other
Processing Aids under Development . Subject to the results of our focused in-plant validation efforts for our approved produce
and poultry solutions, we intend to seek approval to utilize PURE Control as a direct food contact processing aid for raw meats, including
beef and pork. In addition, we may identify other food processing opportunities for SDC.

Axen30
Registration 

Axen30
is a hard surface disinfectant and is a predecessor product to SDC3A. It offers similar broad-spectrum efficacy but longer kill times.
Axen30 is not approved for use on food contact surfaces. Axen30 is currently sold on a limited basis by distributors under their respective
private labels. 

11 

Axenohl
Registration 

Axenohl
is registered as a raw material ingredient for the manufacturing of EPA-registered products and as such does not carry specific efficacy
claims. Axenohl is sold to distributors who manufacture their own respective end-use products. 

Intellectual
Property 

Our
policy is to pursue patents and trademarks, maintain trade secrets and use other means to protect our technology, inventions and improvements
that are commercially important to the development of our business. 

We
have applied for U.S. and foreign patent protection for our SDC technology. Currently, we own twelve U.S. issued patents. Approximately
thirty patents have been issued outside of the U.S., and we own approximately four patents pending around the world. The expiration dates
for our twelve U.S. issued patents begin in 2018 and end in 2030. In September 2013, we decided to abandon pending and issued patents
in non-strategic international territories. We intend to focus our future patent prosecution and defense efforts primarily to North America,
Europe, Asia and Mexico. 

Additional
patent applications may not be granted, or, if granted, may not provide adequate protection to us. We also intend to rely on whatever
protection the law affords to trade secrets, including unpatented know-how. Other companies, however, may independently develop equivalent
or superior technologies or processes and may obtain patents or similar rights with respect thereto. 

Although
we believe that we have developed our technology independently and have not infringed, and do not infringe, on the patents of others,
third parties may make claims that our technology does infringe on their patents or other intellectual property. In the event of infringement,
we may, under certain circumstances, be required to modify our infringing product or process or obtain a license. We may not be able
to do either of those things in a timely manner if at all, and failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business.
In addition, we may not have the financial or other resources necessary to enforce a patent infringement or proprietary rights violation
action or to defend ourselves against such actions brought by others. If any of the products we develop infringe upon the patent or proprietary
rights of others, we could, under certain circumstances, be enjoined or become liable for damages, which would have a material adverse
effect on our business. 

We
also rely on confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements with our employees, customers, consultants, advisors, licensees and potential
partners to protect our technology, intellectual property and other proprietary property. Pursuant to the foregoing and for other reasons,
we face the risk that our competitors may acquire information which we consider to be proprietary, that such parties may breach such
agreements or that such agreements will be inadequate or unenforceable. 

Further,
we own the registered trademarks or pending trademark applications for PURE Bioscience , Powered by SDC Ag+ ,
PURE , Axenohl , Axen , SILV RION , and PURE Control .
In addition, we have applications for other trademarks pending around the world, which may or may not be granted. We previously allowed
the marks Kinderguard , Cruise Control , Staphacide , Nutripure , Elderguard ,
and Critterguard to go abandoned, as they were no longer in line with our food safety business strategy. 

Research
and Development 

We
recognize the importance of innovation to our business strategy and long-term success. A key aspect of our business strategy is to leverage
our technology platform to develop additional proprietary products and applications, including end use products and raw material formulations
derived from our technology platform. We conduct our primary research and development activities in-house and use third-party laboratories
to conduct independent testing. We also engage development partners to perform research and development activities at their own expense
for specific products and processes using SDC. 

12 

Sales
and Marketing 

A
critical aspect of our business strategy is to leverage the industry experience of our internal sales force, the members of our Board
of Directors and our management team in order to maximize the commercial potential of our technology platform in the food industry. 

According
to the CDC, FDA and other food industry sources, food contamination and food borne illnesses have been increasing. We believe our focus
on food safety is addressing a significant need to provide safe, non-toxic and effective solutions to mitigate the increase of food contamination
and food borne illnesses. We believe our products can be used effectively to prevent or mitigate the risk of food contaminants in various
stages of the food supply chain. Our current sales and marketing efforts include demonstrating our SDC products effectiveness
as a hard surface disinfectant and sanitizer for: 

1. 
 Foodservice
 operators and food transportation companies such as food preparation and cooking surfaces; consumer eating and other common
 areas; drink and ice dispensers; and trucks used to transport food. 

2. 
 Food
 manufacturers and processors such as food production and transportation equipment. 

Our
sales team is actively developing customer relationships with certain segments of foodservice operators, food processors, food manufacturers
and food transportation companies. Due to the recent introduction of our food safety products and the importance of food safety to our
customers, the sales cycle to secure a new customer is long and unpredictable. We have recently completed and are currently conducting
numerous product evaluation trials and comparative testing of our SDC-based products with prospective customers, which we believe will
result in future revenue. We believe our products provide superior pathogen and hygiene control performance characteristics as compared
with legacy chemical products, which also have higher toxicity profiles than our SDC-based products. 

In
addition to our direct sales and marketing efforts, we intend to selectively form partnerships with industry leaders for a variety of
uses and applications of our products and technology. These partnerships may be for both U.S. and international markets where we believe
we may leverage the product development, sales and marketing resources of business partners to commercialize our SDC technology in their
respective markets. 

Sales
Concentration 

Net
product sales were 3,698,000 and 6,917,000 for the years ended July 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. For the year ended July 31, 2021,
one individual customer accounted for 11 of our net product sales. No other individual customer accounted for 10 or more of our net
product sales. The geographic breakdown of net product sales was as follows: 100 U.S. For the year ended July 31, 2020, three individual
customers accounted for 16 , 13 and 11 of our net product sales. No other individual customer accounted for 10 or more of our net
product sales. The geographic breakdown of net product sales was as follows: 98 U.S. and 2 foreign. 

From
time to time, one or a small number of our customers may represent a significant percentage of our revenue. Our largest customer accounted
for 11 of our revenue for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2021. Although we have agreements with many of our customers, these agreements
typically do not prohibit customers from purchasing products and services from competitors. A decision by any of our major customers
to significantly reduce the amount of product ordered or license fees paid, or their failure or inability to pay amounts owed to us in
a timely manner, or at all, could have a significant adverse effect on our business. 

13 

Competition 

The
markets for our SDC-based products and each of their potential applications are highly competitive. We have a number of competitors that
vary in size, scope and breadth of products offered. These competitors include some of the largest global corporations, and most of our
competitors have significantly greater financial resources than we do and offer multiple service and product offerings as well as consulting
services to their customers. We expect to face additional competition from other competitors and technologies in the future. 

Because
SDC is a new antimicrobial technology to the food industry, our success will depend, in part, upon our ability to achieve a share of
our target markets at the expense of established and future products. Even where SDC may have technological competitive advantages over
competing products, we, our partners, or our distributors, will need to invest significant resources in order to attempt to displace
traditional technologies sold by, what are in many cases, well-known industry leaders. 

Our
SDC-based products (especially at higher silver ion concentration levels) are typically more expensive to produce than existing treatment
chemicals, and as a result, customers may not purchase our products for cost reasons, even if we are successful in demonstrating the
superior efficacy our products. Further, customers may determine that the other benefits offered by our products (e.g., non-toxic, non-caustic,
and neutral to positive yield impact) are not sufficient to overcome the lower cost products offered by our competitors. 

Manufacturing 

Effective
June 9, 2019, we entered into a five-year manufacturing supply agreement with Intercon Chemical Company (ICC) with a three-year renewal
term option (the Manufacturing Supply Agreement ). The agreement consists of manufacturing, packaging, and distribution
of PURE s SDC-based products. The Manufacturing Supply Agreement provides: 

ICC
 licenses PURE s patents and technology know-how for the non-exclusive manufacture of PURE s SDC-based products. 

ICC
 will invest in plant improvements to allow for expanded SDC production. 

ICC s
 R D team will collaborate on SDC product line development. 

The
Manufacturing Supply Agreement may be terminated by mutual written consent, or by either party upon the material breach of the terms
of the agreement by the other party. 

Silver
is the primary active ingredient in SDC and is a readily available commodity. The other active and inactive ingredients in our products
are readily available from multiple sources. 

Government
Regulation 

Our
business is subject to various government regulations relating to the protection of public health and the environment. Among these are
laws that regulate the manufacture, storage, distribution and labeling of our products, as well as the use, handling, storage and disposal
of certain materials in the manufacturing of our products. 

Regulation
in the United States 

Certain
environmental and regulatory matters significant to us are discussed below. 

14 

Requirements
Imposed by the EPA and Similar State Agencies 

We
manufacture and sell in the U.S. certain disinfecting products that kill or reduce microorganisms (bacteria, viruses, fungi). The manufacture,
labeling, handling and use of these products are regulated by the EPA under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act,
or FIFRA. We currently sell three products registered by the EPA under FIFRA, certain of which are approved for use on food contact surfaces
and others of which are approved for use on non-food contact hard surfaces. EPA product registration requires meeting certain efficacy,
toxicity and labeling requirements and paying ongoing registration fees. 

Although
states do not generally impose substantive requirements different from those of the EPA, each state in which our products are sold requires
registration and payment of a fee. California and certain other states have adopted additional regulatory programs applicable to these
types of products that, in some cases, impose a fee on total product sales in the state. 

Based
on our experience and our knowledge of current trends, we expect the costs and delays in receiving necessary federal and state approvals
for these types of products may increase in the coming years. 

Requirements
Imposed by Ingredient Legislation 

Numerous
federal, state and local laws regulate the sale of products containing certain identified ingredients that may impact human health and
the environment. For instance, California has enacted Proposition 65, which requires the disclosure of specified listed ingredient chemicals
on the labels of products. Although none of the ingredients in our current products is reportable under Proposition 65, this and other
similar legislation may become more comprehensive in the future and/or new products we may develop could be subject to these regulations. 

Requirements
Imposed by Other Environmental Laws 

A
number of federal, state and local environmental, health and safety laws govern the use, handling, storage and disposal of certain materials.
Our current manufacturing process for SDC-based products is a zero waste process, meaning that no byproducts are created,
and we do not use hazardous materials, as defined by applicable environmental laws, in the manufacturing of these products. As such,
some of these U.S. environmental laws are not generally applicable to us in their current form. However, these laws may in the future
identify as hazardous materials certain materials that we use in our manufacturing processes, or we may opt to or be forced to change
our manufacturing procedures in a way that subjects our products or operations to these laws. 

15 

Requirements
Imposed by the FDA and USDA 

Various
laws and regulations have been enacted by federal, state, local and foreign jurisdictions regulating certain products we anticipate manufacturing
and selling for controlling microbial growth in or on foods. In the United States, these requirements generally are administered by the
FDA. However, the U.S. Department of Agriculture and EPA also may share in regulatory jurisdiction of antimicrobials applied directly
to food as it pertains to poultry and meats. 

Regulation
Outside the United States 

The
commercialization of SDC-based products in countries other than the U.S. may require that we, or companies with whom we partner for such
foreign commercialization, obtain necessary approvals from foreign regulatory authorities comparable to the EPA and USDA, among others.
Applicable approval processes and ongoing requirements vary from country to country and may involve more time and expense than that required
to obtain approvals in the U.S. In international markets, we currently sell our products under active registrations held by us, or by
our distributors. We intend to continue to process registrations ourselves or through distributors as required. 

We
currently hold a registration from Health Canada for our disinfectant product. Other third-party distributors hold registrations in China
and are actively pursuing registrations for our disinfectant products in various Asian markets. Additionally, an opinion has been granted
under the Scientific Committee on Consumer Products to sell SDC in the European Union for use in cosmetics, which includes personal care
products. 

Employees 

As
of October 28, 2021, we employed 10 full-time and 1 part-time employee. We believe that we have been successful in attracting skilled
and experienced personnel, but competition for personnel is intense and there can be no assurance that we will be able to attract and
retain qualified personnel in the future. None of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements and we consider relations
with our employees to be good. 

Company
Information 

We
were incorporated in the state of California in August 1992 as Innovative Medical Services. In September 2003, we changed our name to
PURE Bioscience. In March 2011, we reincorporated in the state of Delaware under the name PURE Bioscience, Inc. 

Our
corporate offices are located at 9669 Hermosa Avenue, Rancho Cucamonga, California 91730. Our telephone number is (619) 596-8600. Our
website address is www.purebio.com. We make available free of charge on our website our periodic and current reports, proxy statements
and other information as soon as reasonably practicable after such reports are filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or
SEC. Information contained on, or accessible through, our website is not part of this report or our other filings with the SEC. Our SEC
filings are also available to the public from the SEC s website at www.sec.gov. 

Item
1A. Risk Factors 

You
should carefully consider the following information about risks and uncertainties that may affect us or our business, together with the
other information appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including our consolidated financial statements and the related
notes thereto. If any of the following events, described as risks, actually occur, either alone or taken together, our business, financial
condition, results of operations and future growth prospects would likely be materially and adversely affected. In these circumstances,
the market price of our common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment in our securities. An investment
in our securities is speculative and involves a high degree of risk. You should not invest in our securities if you cannot bear the economic
risk of your investment for an indefinite period of time and cannot afford to lose your entire investment. There may be additional risks
that we do not presently know of or that we currently believe are immaterial which could also impair our business and financial position. 

16 

Risks
Related to Our Business and Industry 

As
a result of our historical lack of financial liquidity, we do not currently have sufficient working capital to fund our planned operations
and may not be able to continue as a going concern. 

We
have a history of recurring losses, and as of July 31, 2021 we have incurred a cumulative net loss of 125,800,000. During the fiscal
year ended July 31, 2021, we recorded a net loss of 2,319,000 on recorded net revenue of 3,927,000. In addition, during the year ended
July 31, 2021 we used 1,688,000 in operating and investing activities resulting in a cash balance of 2,390,000 as of July 31, 2021.
As a result, our existing cash resources are not sufficient to meet our anticipated needs over the next twelve months from the date hereof,
and we will need to raise additional capital to continue our operations and to implement our business plan, which capital may not be
available on acceptable terms or at all. 

Our
capital requirements will depend on many factors, including, among others: 

the
 market acceptance of, and demand for, our products; 

the
 timing and costs of executing our sales and marketing strategies; 

our
 ability to successfully complete the in-plant validation trials requested by potential customers and our ability to convert these
 trials into customer orders for our products; 

the
 costs and time required to obtain the necessary regulatory approvals for our products, including the required USDA approvals: 

the
 extent to which we invest in new testing and product development, including in-plant optimization trials; 

the
 extent to which our customers continue to place product orders as expected and expand their existing use of our products; 

the
 cost and time to satisfy unique customer requirements regarding validation trials or to support the value proposition and benefits
 of our products; 

the
 timing of vendor payments and the collection of receivables, among other factors affecting our working capital; 

our
 ability to control the timing and amount of our operating expenses, including the costs to attract and retain personnel with the
 skills required to implement our business plan; and 

the
 costs to file, prosecute and defend our intellectual property rights. 

The
above factors, along with our history and near term forecast of incurring net losses and negative operating cash flows, raise substantial
doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. If we do not obtain additional capital from external sources, we will not have
sufficient working capital to fund our planned operations or be able to continue as a going concern. We cannot assure you that additional
financing will be available when needed or that, if available, we can obtain financing on terms favorable to us or to our stockholders.
If we raise additional funds from the issuance of equity securities, substantial dilution to our existing stockholders would likely result.
If we raise additional funds by incurring debt financing, the terms of the debt may involve significant cash payment obligations as well
as covenants and specific financial ratios that may restrict our ability to operate our business. Further, any contracts or license arrangements
we enter into to raise funds may require us to relinquish our rights to our products or technology, and we cannot assure you that we
will be able to enter into any such contracts or license arrangements on acceptable terms, or at all. Having insufficient funds may require
us to delay or scale back our marketing, distribution and other commercialization activities or cease our operations altogether. 

17 

We
have a history of losses, and we may not achieve or maintain profitability. 

We
had net income of 4,000 for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2020 but had a loss of 2.2 million for the fiscal year ended July
31, 2021. As of July 31, 2021, we have incurred a cumulative net loss of approximately 126 million. Although we believe we are making
progress on implementing our business plan focused on the food safety market, we expect to continue to have losses in future periods.
None of our existing agreements, including those with Packers Sanitation Services, Inc, Subway and Chipotle, contain provisions that
provide for fixed or minimum revenues. If the penetration into the marketplace of PURE Hard Surface, PURE Control and our other SDC-based
products is unsuccessful, our revenue growth is slower than anticipated or our operating expenses exceed expectations, we may not achieve
profitability, and we may never achieve profitability again. Slower than anticipated revenue growth could force us to reduce our
sales and marketing efforts, our product testing and optimization, and our product development and regulatory initiatives, and/or force
us to reduce the size and scope of our operations, to sell or license our technologies to third parties, or to cease operations altogether.
Given our recent introduction of our SDC-based products in the food safety market, we are unable to predict the extent of any future
income or our future losses and we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on an ongoing basis. 

The
currently evolving situation related to the COVID-19 pandemic could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of
operations. 

The
COVID-19 pandemic has led to severe disruptions in general economic activities, as businesses and federal, state, and local governments
take increasingly broad actions to mitigate this public health crisis. While we have experienced some delays related to final third-party
validation of certain of our products and product rollouts by customers using PURE Control, we have not experienced a material disruption
to our business. In addition, we previously benefited from increased demand from our customers for our PURE Hard Surface product
due to a focus on surface disinfecting in response to attempting to prevent COVID-19 transmission. We subsequently experienced an
abatement in such demand and cannot assure you that demand will stabilize. Additionally, we are beginning to experience
supply chain issues with our various plastic packaging configurations and citric acid. Further, on a go-forward basis, we cannot
guarantee the overall economic conditions will not affect our business, as these conditions may significantly negatively impact all aspects
of our business. Our business is dependent on the continued health and productivity of our employees, including our sales staff and corporate
management team. 

Additionally,
our liquidity could be negatively impacted if these conditions continue for a significant period of time and we may be required to pursue
additional sources of financing to obtain working capital, maintain appropriate inventory levels, and meet our financial obligations.
Currently, capital and credit markets have been disrupted by the crisis and our ability to obtain any required financing is not guaranteed
and largely dependent upon evolving market conditions and other factors. Depending on the continued impact of the crisis, further actions
may be required to improve our cash position and capital structure. 

The
extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic ultimately impacts our business, sales, results of operations and financial condition will depend
on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including, but not limited to, the duration of the outbreak,
its severity, the actions to contain the virus or treat its impact, and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating
conditions resume and, more specifically, the effect it has on our customers and suppliers. Even after the COVID-19 pandemic has subsided,
we may experience significant impacts to our business as a result of its global economic impact, including any economic downturn or recession
that has occurred or may occur in the future. 

18 

Raising
additional funds by issuing securities or through collaboration and licensing arrangements may cause dilution to existing stockholders,
restrict our operations or require us to relinquish proprietary rights. 

We
may need to increase our liquidity and capital resources in future periods. We have a history of raising funds through offerings of our
common stock and warrants to purchase shares of our common stock, and we may in the future raise additional funds through public or private
equity offerings, debt financings or corporate collaborations and licensing arrangements. To the extent that we raise additional capital
by issuing equity securities, our stockholders ownership will be diluted. Additionally, any debt financing we obtain may involve
covenants that restrict our operations. These restrictive covenants may include, among other things, limitations on borrowing, specific
restrictions on the use of our assets, as well as prohibitions on our ability to create liens on our assets, pay dividends on or redeem
our capital stock or make investments. In addition, if we raise funds through collaboration and licensing arrangements, it may be necessary
to grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us or relinquish potentially valuable rights to our products or proprietary technologies.
We may be required in future collaborations to relinquish all or a portion of our sales and marketing rights with respect to our products
or license intellectual property that enable licensees to develop competing products in order to complete any such transaction. 

As
of October 28, 2021, we have 98,207,531 shares of common stock issued and outstanding or reserved for issuance under equity compensation
plans, vested and unvested options, warrants, and unvested restricted stock units. Our current authorized capital stock is limited to
150,000,000 shares of common stock and 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock. Any increase in our authorized capital stock would require
the approval of a majority of our shareholders as well as the approval of our Board of Directors. If we were unable to increase our authorized
capital stock for any reason, our ability to raise additional capital through the issuance of equity or convertible debt would be severely
compromised and we may be unable to obtain equity or convertible debt capital at all. 

We
need to continue to increase customer awareness and adoption of our food safety product offerings, PURE Hard Surface and PURE Control. 

Our
success will depend on our ability to continue to increase customer awareness and adoption of our food safety product offerings, PURE
Hard Surface and PURE Control. We only recently received the required FDA and USDA approvals to market PURE Control as a direct food
contact processing aid for fresh produce and as a spray or dip applied to raw poultry carcasses, parts and organs in pre-OLR (on-line
reprocessing) and post chill processing. Due to the recent introduction of our food safety products and the importance of food safety
to our customers, the sales cycle to secure new customers is long and unpredictable. We have encountered and likely will continue to
encounter risks and difficulties associated with introducing or establishing new commercial products in this highly competitive and rapidly
evolving market. These risks include the following, among others: 

we
 may not be successful in demonstrating the effectiveness of PURE Control in actual in-plant use situations or satisfy the requirements
 of our potential customers; 

19 

we
 may not be successful in converting in-plant trials into customer product orders; 

our
 SDC-based product offerings (especially at higher silver-ion concentrations) are typically more expensive to produce than existing
 treatment chemicals, and as a result, customers may not purchase our products for cost reasons, even if we are successful in demonstrating
 the superior efficacy or other benefits of our products; 

our
 customers may not continue to place product orders as expected or may not expand their use of our products; 

we
 may not be successful in demonstrating the value proposition of our products, including its non-corrosive and non-toxic characteristics
 and its neutral to positive processing yield impact; 

we
 may not succeed in materially penetrating the food safety markets with our SDC products and technology; 

we
 may not be successful in developing an effective sales and marketing infrastructure to commercialize our products; 

we
 may not generate sufficient revenues or raise sufficient funds to support our operations or the implementation of our business plan; 

we
 may not be successful in controlling our operating expenses; 

we
 may not be successful in obtaining any required regulatory approvals on a timely basis, or at all; 

we
 may not attract and retain key sales and marketing, technical and management personnel; 

we
 may not successfully comply with or maintain the regulatory approvals we obtain for our technology and products; 

we
 may not succeed in locating strategic partners and licensees of our technology; 

we
 may not effectively manage our anticipated growth, if any; and 

we
 may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property. 

Any
failure to successfully address these risks and uncertainties could seriously harm our business and prospects. 

20 

We
may not be able to correctly estimate our future revenues and operating expenses, which could lead to cash shortfalls, and require us
to secure additional financing sooner than planned. 

We
may not correctly predict the amount or timing of future revenues and our operating expenses may fluctuate significantly in the future
as a result of a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control. These factors include: 

our
 expectations regarding revenues from sales of our products; 

the
 time and resources required to complete in-plant validation and optimization trials; 

the
 cost and time to develop and obtain regulatory approvals for additional products as part of our long-term business plan; 

the
 cost and time required to create effective sales and marketing capabilities and commercialization strategies; 

the
 expenses we incur to maintain and improve our platform technology; 

the
 cost and time to satisfy unique customer requirements regarding validation and optimization trails; 

the
 costs to attract and retain personnel with the skills required for effective operations; and 

the
 costs of preparing, filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing patent claims and other patent related costs, including litigation
 costs and the results of such litigation. 

In
addition, our budgeted expense levels are based in part on our expectations concerning current and future revenues from sales of our
products and services, and from collaborations with third parties. However, we may not correctly predict the amount or timing of future
revenues. In addition, we may not be able to adjust our operations in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected shortfall in our
revenues or we may increase our expenses as part of implementing our long-term business plan. As a result, a significant shortfall in
our planned revenues or a significant increase in our planned expenses could have an immediate and material adverse effect on our business
and financial condition. In such case, we may be required to issue additional equity or debt securities or enter into other commercial
arrangements, including relationships with corporate and other partners, sooner than anticipated to secure the additional financial resources
to support our development efforts and future operations. 

Our
quarterly operating results may vary, which could negatively affect the market price of our common stock. 

Because
of our limited operating history and the early commercial stage of our SDC-based products in the food safety market, we have limited
insight into trends that may emerge and affect our business. Forecasting future revenues is difficult, especially because we have only
recent begun to generate meaningful revenues from the sale of our SDC-based products, our products are novel, and market acceptance of
our products is reliant on our customers confidence, based on scientific data and actual in-plant trials, that our product can
improve their food safety efforts. Because food safety is such a critical factor to our customers and potential customers, we often experience
long sales cycles and our customers often require extensive evaluation and in-plant trial periods before agreeing to use our products
throughout their systems. In addition, fluctuations in the buying patterns of our current or potential customers could significantly
affect the level of our sales on a period to period basis. Additional factors that could cause our financial results to fluctuate unexpectedly,
include: the mix of product sales, the cost of product sales, our ability to meet customer demand, delays in achieving our regulatory
milestones, changes in our operating expenses, including non-cash expenses such as the fair value of stock options granted to our employees,
and manufacturing or supply issues. As a result, our quarterly operating results may vary, which could negatively affect the market price
of our common stock. 

21 

A
loss of one or more of our key customers could adversely affect our business. 

From
time to time, one or a small number of our customers may represent a significant percentage of our revenue. Our largest customers accounted
for 11 of our net product sales for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2021. No other individual customer accounted for 10 or more of our
net product sales. Although we have agreements with many of our customers, these agreements typically do not prohibit customers from
purchasing products and services from competitors or contain minimum purchase obligations. A decision by any of our major customers to
significantly reduce the amount of product ordered or license fees paid, or their failure or inability to pay amounts owed to us in a
timely manner, or at all, could have a significant adverse effect on our business. 

We
are dependent on our core SDC technology and if our efforts to achieve or maintain market acceptance of our core SDC technology are not
successful, we are unlikely to continue to maintain profitability. 

We
have and are currently focusing substantially all of our time and financial resources in the development and commercialization of our
core SDC technology to address food safety risks across the food industry supply chain. Although our SDC technology has applications
in multiple industries, we expect that sales of SDC and SDC-based products as a food safety solution will constitute a substantial portion,
or all, of our revenues in future periods. We are marketing our SDC-based products to restaurant chains, food manufacturers, food processors
and food transportation companies. Our SDC-based products have not yet been broadly accepted into the food safety market, and may never
be broadly accepted. Any material decrease or significant delay in the overall level of sales or expected sales of, or the prices for,
our SDC-based products, whether as a result of competition, delays in obtaining regulatory approvals, long sales cycles, change in customer
demands or requirements, or any other factor, would have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results
of operations. In addition, even if our products achieve market acceptance, we may not be able to maintain product sales or other forms
of revenue over time if new products or technologies are introduced by competitors that are more favorably received than our products,
are more cost-effective or otherwise render our products less attractive or obsolete. 

We
are subject to intense competition in the food safety market. 

Our
SDC-based products compete in the highly competitive food safety market. Our SDC-based product offerings (especially at higher silver
ion concentration levels) are typically more expensive to produce than existing treatment chemicals, and as a result, customers may not
purchase our products for cost reasons, even if we are successful in demonstrating the superior efficacy of our products. In addition,
customers may determine that the other benefits offered by our products (e.g., non-toxic, non-caustic, and neutral to positive yield
impact) are not sufficient to overcome the lower cost products offered by our competitors. Further, most of our competitors have been
in business for a longer period of time than we have, and offer a greater number of products and services than we do and have greater
financial, technical, sales and other resources than we do. Many of our competitors already have well established brands and distribution
capabilities, and in some cases are able to leverage the sale of other products with more favorable terms for products competing with
our own. We also have significantly fewer sales personnel than virtually all of our competitors. Furthermore, recent trends in this industry
are for large food safety companies to consolidate into a smaller number of very large entities, which further concentrates financial,
technical and market strength and increases competitive pressure in the industry. If we directly compete with these very large entities
for the same markets and/or products, their financial strength could prevent or delay us from capturing a meaningful share the food safety
market. It is also possible that developments by our competitors will make our technologies or products noncompetitive or obsolete. Our
ability to compete will depend upon our ability, and the ability of our distributors and other partners, to develop brand recognition,
develop the scientific and plant trial data to demonstrate the efficacy of our products, and to displace existing, established and future
products in our relevant target markets. We, or our distributors and partners, may not be successful in doing so, which would have a
materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

22 

We
have limited sales, marketing and product distribution experience. 

We
have limited experience in the sales, marketing and distribution of our products in the food safety market. We began to focus on the
food safety market in August 2013. We received the required FDA approvals to market PURE Control as a direct food contact processing
aid for fresh produce in January 2016. We received the required USDA and FDA approvals to market PURE Control for use as a spray or dip
applied to poultry carcasses, parts and organs in pre-OLR (on-line reprocessing) and post chill processing of fresh poultry in July 2016
and May 2017, respectively. As a result, our sales and marketing experience with these products are limited, and our current sales, distribution
and marketing strategies and programs may not be successful. Further, due to the recent introduction of our food safety products and
the importance of food safety to our customers, the sales cycle to secure a new customer is long and unpredictable. Potential customers
typically require that we complete extensive in-plant validation studies with our products. We may not be successful in demonstrating
the effectiveness of PURE Control in actual in-plant use situations or satisfy the requirements of our potential customers. Moreover,
we may not be successful in converting in-plant trials into customer product orders. We also have a relatively small sales and marketing
organization and a limited number of distributors. We may not be able to establish the sales, marketing, and distribution capabilities
necessary to build our business and generate sufficient revenues to support our operations and the implementation of our business plan. 

We
are dependent on a third-party, over whom we have limited control, to manufacture our SDC-based products. 

On
June 9, 2019, we entered into a five-year strategic collaboration agreement with St. Louis-based Intercon Chemical Company ICC where we granted ICC the right to be the exclusive manufacture for all our SDC-based products. We do not have any manufacturing facilities
ourselves and we currently rely on ICC to manufacture our SDC-based products and may in the future rely on one or more third-party manufacturers
to properly manufacture our products. We may not be able to quickly replace our manufacturing capacity if ICC is unable to manufacturer
our products as a result of a fire, natural disaster (including an earthquake), equipment failure or other difficulty, or if such ICC
facilities are deemed not in compliance with current good manufacturing practices, and the noncompliance could not be rapidly
rectified. ICC is our single manufacturer for our SDC-based products and may not be replaced without significant effort and delay in
production. A supply interruption or an increase in demand beyond our current manufacturer s capabilities could harm our ability
to manufacturer such products until new manufacturers are identified and qualified, which would have a significant adverse effect on
our business and results. Any third-party manufacturer that we find may not match our quality standards or be able to meet customer requirements. 

Additionally,
our inability or reduced capacity to have our products manufactured would prevent us from successfully evaluating or commercializing
our proposed products. Our dependence upon third parties for the manufacture of our products may adversely affect our profit margins
and our ability to develop and deliver proposed products on a timely and competitive basis. 

We
rely on third parties to develop SDC-based products, and they may not do so successfully or diligently. 

We
have granted ICC and other third parties to whom we license rights to our technology certain distribution and development rights to products
containing SDC for applications and markets outside the U.S. food safety market. Our reliance on ICC and other third parties for development
and distribution activities reduces our control over these activities. In such arrangements, we have relied, and expect in the future
to rely, on the third party to fund and direct product development activities and appropriate regulatory filings. Any of these third
parties may not be able to successfully develop such SDC-based products due to, among other factors, a lack of capital, a lack of appropriate
diligence, insufficient devotion to sales efforts, a change in the evaluation by the third party of the market potential for SDC-based
products, technical failures, and poorer than expected results from testing or trial use of any products that may be developed. If the
third parties on which we rely are not successful in such development activities, our business and operating results would be adversely
affected. 

23 

Pricing
and supply issues may have a material impact on our margins and our ability to supply our customers. 

All
of the supply ingredients used to manufacture our SDC-based products are available from multiple suppliers. However, commodity prices
for some ingredients can vary significantly and the margins that we are able to generate could decline if prices rise. For example, both
silver and citric acid prices have been volatile in recent periods. 

In
addition to such commodities, we also rely on producers of specialized packaging inputs such as bottles and labels for finished products.
Due to their specialized nature, the supply of such inputs can be periodically constrained and result in additional costs to obtain these
items, which may in turn inhibit our ability to supply products to our customers. 

We
are generally unable to increase our product prices to our customers, partners and distributors quickly in order to maintain our margins,
and significant price increases for key inputs could therefore have an adverse effect on our results of operations. Price increases can
also result in lost sales, and any inability to supply our customers orders can lead to lost future sales to such customers. 

We
expect ICC to be the sole source supplier of our SDC concentrate and we may use other third parties to blend, package and provide fulfillment
activities for our finished products in future periods. We expect that our margins may be reduced by using ICC and other such third parties,
and our ability to maintain product quality may not be as extensive or effective as when we produce these products in our own facility(ies).
Any quality control issues could lead to product recalls and/or the loss of future sales, which would reduce our revenues and/or profits. 

If
we are not able to manage any growth we achieve effectively, our business and operating results will be harmed. 

In
order to implement our business plan and achieve and maintain market acceptance of our SDC-based products, we expect to expand our business
operations and hire additional sales and support personnel. We may not have sufficient resources to do so. If we hire additional personnel
and invest in additional infrastructure, we may not be effective in expanding our operations and our systems, procedures or controls
may not be adequate to support any such expansion. Failure to properly manage our growth could have a material adverse effect on our
business and our operating results. 

If
we suffer negative publicity concerning the safety or efficacy of our products, our sales may be harmed. 

If
concerns should arise about the safety or efficacy of any of our products that are marketed, regardless of whether or not such concerns
have a basis in generally accepted science or peer-reviewed scientific research, such concerns could adversely affect the market for
those products. Similarly, negative publicity could result in an increased number of product liability claims, whether or not those claims
are supported by applicable law. 

We
may become subject to product liability claims. 

As
a business that manufactures and markets products for use by consumers and institutions, we may become liable for any damage caused by
our products, whether used in the manner intended or not, including potentially damage to our customers businesses. Regardless
of merit or potential outcome, product liability claims against us may result in, among other effects, the inability to commercialize
our products, impairment of our business reputation, and distraction of management s attention from our primary business. If we
cannot successfully defend ourselves against product liability claims we could incur substantial liabilities. Although we maintain general
and product liability insurance, our insurance may not cover potential claims and may not be adequate to indemnify for liabilities that
may be imposed. Any imposition of liability that is not covered by insurance or is in excess of insurance coverage could harm our business
and operating results. 

We
depend on key personnel for our continued operations and future success, and a loss of certain key personnel could significantly hinder
our ability to move forward with our business plan. 

Our
success depends largely on the execution of our business strategy by our management team and the members of our Board of Directors. Our
Board and management will be evaluating how to best execute our near-term strategy to drive customer adoption in the food industry by
addressing food safety solutions across the supply chain in order to prevent or mitigate food contamination or the potential for food-borne
illness with specific customer focus in foodservice providers, food processors and food manufacturers. Our directors, executive officers
and key personnel could terminate their services with us at any time without notice and without penalty. Additionally, we do not maintain
key person life insurance policies on our directors, executive officers or other employees. The loss of one or more of our directors,
executive officers or key employees could seriously harm our ability to execute on our business strategy, which could harm our business,
results of operations, financial condition, and/or the market price of our common stock. We cannot assure you that in such an event we
would be able to recruit qualified personnel able to replace these individuals in a timely manner, or at all, on terms acceptable to
either us or to any qualified candidate. Even if we were able to replace any such individuals in a timely manner, if we are unable to
effectively integrate new executive officers or key employees, our operations and prospects could be harmed. 

24 

Because
competition for highly qualified sales and marketing and management personnel is intense, we may not be able to attract and retain the
employees we need to support our potential growth. 

To
successfully meet our objectives, we must attract and retain highly qualified sales and marketing and management personnel with specialized
skill sets focused on the industries in which we compete, or intend to compete. Competition for qualified business development and bioengineering
personnel can be intense. Our ability to meet our business development objectives will depend in part on our ability to recruit, train
and retain top quality people with advanced skills who understand our technology and business. In addition, it takes time for our new
personnel to become productive and to learn our business. If we are unable to hire or retain qualified personnel, it will be difficult
for us to sell our products or to license our technology or to achieve or maintain regulatory approvals, and we may experience a shortfall
in revenue and not achieve our anticipated, or any, growth. 

We
may engage in strategic transactions that could impact our liquidity, increase our expenses and present significant distractions to our
management. 

From
time to time we may consider engaging in strategic transactions, such as acquisitions of companies, asset purchases and out-licensing
or in-licensing of products, product candidates or technologies. Any such transaction may require us to incur non-recurring or other
charges, may increase our near and long-term expenditures and may pose significant integration challenges or disrupt our management or
business, which could adversely affect our operations and financial results. For example, these transactions may entail numerous operational
and financial risks, including, among others, exposure to unknown liabilities, disruption of our business and diversion of our management s
time and attention in order to develop acquired products, product candidates or technologies, difficulty and cost in combining the operations
and personnel of any acquired businesses with our operations and personnel, and inability to retain key employees of any acquired businesses.
Accordingly, although we may not choose to undertake or may not be able to successfully complete any transactions of the nature described
above, any transactions that we do undertake or complete could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations,
financial condition and prospects. 

We
may invest or spend our cash in ways with which you may not agree or in ways which may not yield a significant return. 

Our
management has considerable discretion in the use of our cash. Our cash may be used for purposes that do not increase our operating results
or market value. Until the cash is used, it may be placed in investments that do not produce significant income or that may lose value.
The failure of our management to invest or spend our cash effectively could result in unfavorable returns and uncertainty about our prospects,
each of which could cause the price of our common stock to decline. 

We
may not be able to utilize all, or any, of our tax net operating loss carry-forwards and our future after-tax earnings, if any, could
be reduced. 

At
July 31, 2021, we had federal and state tax net operating loss carry-forwards of approximately 107.5 million and 62.3 million, respectively.
Utilization of these net operating loss carry-forwards may be subject to a substantial annual limitation due to ownership change limitations
that may have occurred, including with respect to our recent private placements, or that could occur in the future, as required by Section
382 of the Internal Revenue Code as well as similar state provisions. These ownership changes may limit the amount of net operating loss
carry-forwards that can be utilized annually to offset future taxable income and tax, respectively. In general, an ownership change,
as defined by Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code, results from a transaction or series of transactions over a three-year period
resulting in an ownership change of more than 50 percentage points of the outstanding stock of a company by certain stockholders or public
groups. Since our formation, we have raised capital through the issuance of capital stock on several occasions (both before and after
our initial public offering in 1996) which, combined with the purchasing stockholders subsequent disposition of those shares,
may have resulted in such an ownership change, or could result in an ownership change in the future based upon subsequent disposition.
While we believe that we have not experienced an ownership change, the pertinent tax rules related thereto are complex and subject to
varying interpretations, and thus the applicable taxing authorities may take an alternative position. 

Our
current federal tax loss carry-forwards began expiring in the year ended July 31, 2020 and, unless previously utilized, all but 3.7
million will completely expire in the year ending July 31, 2038. The 3.7 million can be carried forward indefinitely. Our state tax
loss carry-forwards began to expire in the year ending July 31, 2029, and will completely expire in the year ending July 31, 2040.

Risks
Related to the Regulation of our Products 

If
we are unable to obtain the required regulatory approvals from the FDA and USDA, or if such efforts are delayed, our ability to commercialize
PURE Control as a direct food contact processing aid will be harmed and our business and operating results will suffer. 

We
received the required FDA approvals to market PURE Control as a direct food contact processing aid for raw poultry and fresh produce
in December 2015 and January 2016, respectively. No additional approval from the USDA is required for fresh produce. In July 2016, we
received a No Objection Letter from the USDA s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) granting approval for SDC-based
PURE Control to be used as a spray or dip applied to poultry carcasses, parts and organs in pre-OLR (on-line reprocessing) and post chill
processing of fresh poultry. In January 2017, we submitted an additional FCN to the FDA to allow use of higher SDC concentrations in
poultry processing, allowing the flexibility to adjust to varying plant and processing conditions. In May 2017, we received a Final Letter
from the FDA for this FCN as well as a No Objection Letter from the USDA s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS)
granting approval for the higher concentrations of SDC-based PURE Control to be used as a spray or dip applied to poultry carcasses,
parts and organs in pre-OLR (on-line reprocessing) and post chill processing of fresh poultry. We have not, however, received the required
approval from the USDA to utilize PURE Control in OLR poultry processing. Further, even if we elect to seek regulatory approval, there
is no assurance we will be successful in obtaining the required approvals from the FDA and USDA to utilize PURE Control as a direct food
contact processing aid for raw meats, including beef and pork. If we are unable to obtain the required regulatory approvals from the
FDA and USDA, or if such efforts are delayed, our ability to commercialize PURE Control as a direct food contact processing aid for poultry
and as a direct food contact processing aid for raw meets will be restricted and our business and operating results will suffer. 

The
industries in which we operate are heavily regulated. 

We
are focused on the marketing and continued development of our SDC antimicrobial technology for use in the food safety market. Our existing
products, PURE Control and PURE Hard Surface, and any additional products we develop based on our SDC technology in future periods, require
or will require approval by government agencies prior to marketing or sale in the U.S. or in foreign markets. Complying with applicable
government regulations and obtaining necessary regulatory approvals can be, and has historically been, time consuming and expensive,
due in part, we believe, to the novel nature of our technology. Regulatory review could involve delays or other actions adversely affecting
the development, manufacture, marketing and sale of our products. While we cannot accurately predict the outcome of any pending or future
regulatory review processes or the extent or impact of any future changes to legislation or regulations affecting review processes, we
expect such processes to remain time consuming and expensive as we, or our partners, apply for approval to make new or additional efficacy
claims for current products or to market new product formulations. Obtaining approvals for new SDC-based products in the U.S., or in
markets outside the U.S., could take several years, or may never be accomplished. 

26 

SDC
is a platform technology rather than a single use applied technology. As such, products developed from the platform may fall under the
jurisdiction of multiple U.S. and international regulatory agencies. Our disinfectant and sanitizer products are regulated in the U.S.
by the EPA. In addition to the EPA, each of the 50 states in the U.S. has its own government agencies that regulate the sale or shipment
of our products into their state. We have obtained registration for these products from the EPA and all states into which such products
are currently marketed and sold. We are required to meet certain efficacy, toxicity and labeling requirements and pay ongoing fees in
order to maintain such registrations. We may not be able to maintain these registrations in the future, which may eliminate our continued
ability to market and sell our products in some or all parts of the U.S. We also may not be able to obtain necessary registrations with
the EPA and applicable states for other SDC disinfectant and sanitizer products that we or our partners may develop, which would limit
our ability to sell any such products in the future. 

Some
potential applications of SDC, such as those aimed at healthcare, veterinary and certain food preparation markets, may require approval
of other government agencies prior to marketing or sale in the U.S. or in foreign markets, such as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration,
or FDA, or the United States Department of Agriculture, or USDA. Obtaining FDA and/or USDA approval is a complicated and expensive process
and such approvals may never be obtained for any SDC products. If FDA and/or USDA approvals are obtained, the approvals may limit the
uses for which SDC products may be marketed such that they may not be profitable to us, and the applicable products would be subject
to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA and/or USDA that could lead to withdrawal or limitation of any product approvals. 

For
example, in November 2014, we withdrew, without prejudice, our FCN for raw poultry due to receipt of a Deficiency Letter from the FDA
stating that the agency has developed new data that is currently under review, which data calls into question the long established safety
levels of the dietary intake of silver in the U.S. from food contact uses previously approved by the FDA. As a result, the FDA indicated
that it would not approve our FCN absent new data or additional information that adequately addresses its new toxicity concerns. We also
received a similar Deficiency Letter from the FDA for the FCN we submitted in October 2014 for the use of SDC to reduce Salmonella, E.
coli and Listeria in the processing of produce. In January 2015, we withdrew, without prejudice, our produce FCN and postponed the filing
of our FCN for the use of SDC as a processing aid for beef and pork. We resubmitted our poultry FCN in June 2015. In September 2015,
we received an Acknowledgement Letter from the FDA stating that our FCN for SDC as a raw poultry processing aid is complete and setting
an effective date of December 2015. Following the completion of additional testing demonstrating further reduction of silver residues
to levels approaching non-detectable, and subsequent encouraging discussions held with the FDA, we resubmitted our produce FCN in September
2015. We received the required FDA approvals to market PURE Control as a direct food contact processing aid for raw poultry and fresh
produce in December 2015 and January 2016, respectively. In July 2016, we received a No Objection Letter from the USDA s
Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) granting approval for SDC-based PURE Control to be used as a spray or dip applied to poultry
carcasses, parts and organs in pre-OLR (on-line reprocessing) and post chill processing of fresh poultry. In January 2017, we submitted
an additional FCN to the FDA to allow use of higher SDC concentrations in poultry processing, allowing the flexibility to adjust to varying
plant and processing conditions. In May 2017, we received a Final Letter from the FDA for this FCN as well as a No Objection Letter 
from the USDA s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) granting approval for the higher concentrations of SDC-based PURE Control
to be used as a spray or dip applied to poultry carcasses, parts and organs in pre-OLR (on-line reprocessing) and post chill processing
of fresh poultry. Further, even if we elect to seek regulatory approval, there is no assurance we will be successful in obtaining the
required approvals from the FDA and USDA to utilize PURE Control as a direct food contact processing aid for raw meats, including beef
and pork. If we are unable to obtain the required regulatory approvals from the FDA and USDA, or if such efforts are delayed, our ability
to commercialize PURE Control as a direct food contact processing aid for poultry and as a direct food contact processing aid for raw
meets will be restricted and our business and operating results will suffer. 

27 

We
intend to fund and manage certain of our EPA-regulated product development internally, in conjunction with engaging regulatory consultants
and partnering with other third parties. We have partnered, or intend to partner, with third parties who are seeking, or intend to seek,
approvals to market SDC-based products in markets outside the U.S., and with other third parties who are developing FDA-regulated SDC-based
products who, upon such development, would seek FDA approvals of such products. Our ability to market and sell our products is dependent
on our and our partners ability to obtain and maintain required registrations and approvals of applicable regulatory agencies.
Failure by our partners or us to comply with applicable regulations could result in fines or the withdrawal of approval for us or our
partners and distributors to market our products in some or all jurisdictions or for certain indications, which could cause us to be
unable to successfully commercialize SDC or otherwise achieve revenues from sales of such products. 

We
are subject to substantial regulation related to quality standards applicable to our manufacturing and quality processes, and our partners,
including our third-party manufacturer, failure to comply with applicable quality standards could affect our ability to commercialize
SDC products. 

The
EPA and other applicable U.S. and foreign government agencies regulate our and our partners systems and processes, including those
of ICC, for manufacturing SDC-based products. These regulations require that we and our partners observe good manufacturing practices 
in order to ensure product quality, safety and effectiveness. Failure by us or our partners to comply with current or future government
regulations and quality assurance guidelines could lead to temporary manufacturing shutdowns, product recalls or related field actions,
product shortages, and/or delays in product manufacturing, any or all of which could cause significant cost to us. Further, efficacy
or safety concerns and/or manufacturing quality issues with respect to our products or those of our partners could lead to product recalls,
fines, withdrawal of approvals, and/or declining sales, any or all of which could result in our failure to successfully commercialize
SDC or otherwise achieve revenue growth. 

Litigation
or the actions of regulatory authorities may harm our business or otherwise distract our management. 

Substantial,
complex or extended litigation could cause us to incur major expenditures and would distract our management. For example, lawsuits against
us or our officers or directors by employees, former employees, stockholders, partners, customers, or others, or actions taken by regulatory
authorities, could be very costly and substantially disrupt our business. Such lawsuits and actions are not uncommon, and we may not
be able to resolve such disputes or actions on terms favorable to us, and there may not be sufficient capital resources available to
defend such actions effectively, or at all. 

Risks
Related to Our Intellectual Property 

If
we are unable to obtain, maintain or defend the patent and other intellectual property rights relating to our technology, we or our collaborators
and distributors may not be able to develop and market proprietary products based on our technology, which would have a material adverse
impact on our results of operations. 

We
rely and expect in the future to continue to rely on a combination of patent, trademark, trade secret and copyright protections, as well
as contractual restrictions, to protect the proprietary aspects of our technology and business. 

Legal
protections of our intellectual property and proprietary rights afford only limited protection. For instance, we currently own twelve
U.S. patents related to our SDC technology. The lives of these patents, and any patents that we may obtain in the future, are not indefinite,
and the value to us of some or all of our patents may be limited by their terms. Further, although we have a number of U.S. and international
patent applications pending, some or all of those applications may not result in issued patents, and the intellectual property claims
therein would be unprotected. Additionally, obtaining and maintaining patent protection depends on our compliance with various procedural,
document submission, fee payment and other requirements imposed by government patent agencies, and our patent protection could be reduced
or eliminated for non-compliance with these requirements. Furthermore, the patent positions of bioscience companies can be highly uncertain
and often involve complex legal, scientific and factual questions, and, therefore, we cannot predict with certainty whether we will be
able to ultimately enforce our patents or other intellectual property rights. Third parties may challenge, invalidate or circumvent our
patents and patent applications relating to our products, product candidates and technologies. In addition, our patent positions might
not protect us against competitors with similar products or technologies because competing products or technologies may not infringe
our patents. 

In
addition, to the extent that we operate internationally, the laws of foreign countries may not protect our proprietary rights to the
same extent as the laws of the U.S. Many countries have a first-to-file trademark registration system, which may prevent
us from registering or using our trademarks in certain countries if third parties have previously filed applications to register or have
registered the same or similar trademarks. Additionally, changes in the patent and/or trademark laws or interpretations of such laws
in the U.S. or other countries could diminish the value of our intellectual property rights. Moreover, our competitors may develop competing
technologies that are not covered by the claims of, and therefore do not infringe upon, our issued patents, which could render our patents
less valuable to us. If our proprietary rights cannot be, or are not sufficiently, protected by patent and trademark registrations, it
could have a material adverse impact on our business and our ability to commercialize or license our technology and products. 

Our
own efforts to protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights may also be insufficient. Despite efforts to protect our
proprietary rights, including without limitation through confidentiality and other similar contractual restrictions, our means of protecting
such rights may not be adequate and unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our proprietary technology, obtain and use information
that we regard as proprietary, or otherwise misappropriate our intellectual property. In addition, unpatented proprietary rights, including
trade secrets and know-how, can be difficult to protect and may lose their value if they are independently developed by a third party
or if their secrecy is lost. It is possible that, despite our efforts, competitors or others will create and use products, adopt service
names similar to our service names or otherwise violate or misappropriate our proprietary rights. The infringement of such rights could
have a material negative impact on our business and on our results of operations. 

28 

Litigation
may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property and other proprietary rights, which would be expensive and could consume time and
other resources. The result of any such litigation may be the court s ruling that our patents or other intellectual property rights
are invalid and/or should not be enforced. Additionally, even if the validity of such rights is upheld, the court could refuse to stop
a third party s infringing activity on the ground that such activities do not infringe our rights. The U.S. Supreme Court has recently
revised certain tests regarding granting patents and assessing the validity of patents to make it more difficult to obtain patents. As
a consequence, issued patents may be found to contain invalid claims according to the newly revised standards. Some of our patents may
be subject to challenge and subsequent invalidation or significant narrowing of claim scope in a reexamination proceeding, or during
litigation, under the revised criteria. 

We
may incur substantial costs as a result of litigation or other proceedings relating to patent and other intellectual property rights
and we may be unable to protect our rights to, or use, our technology. 

If
we choose to go to court to attempt to stop someone else from using the inventions claimed in our patents, that individual or company
has the right to ask the court to rule that our patents are invalid and/or should not be enforced against that third party. These lawsuits
are expensive and would consume time and other resources even if we were successful in stopping the infringement of these patents. In
addition, there is a risk that the court will decide that these patents are not valid and that we do not have the right to stop the other
party from using the inventions. There is also the risk that, even if the validity of these patents is upheld, the court will refuse
to stop the other party on the ground that such other party s activities do not infringe our rights to these patents. 

Furthermore,
a third party may claim that we are using inventions covered by the third party s patent rights and may file an injunction to stop
us from engaging in our normal operations and activities, including making or selling our products. These lawsuits are costly and could
affect our results of operations and divert the attention of managerial and technical personnel. There is a risk that a court would decide
that we are infringing the third party s patents and would order us to stop the activities covered by the patents. In addition,
there is a risk that a court will order us to pay the other party damages for having violated the other party s patents. The biotechnology
industry has produced a proliferation of patents, and it is not always clear to industry participants, including us, which patents cover
various types of products or methods of use. The coverage of patents is subject to interpretation by the courts, and the interpretation
is not always uniform. If we are sued for patent infringement, we would need to demonstrate that our products or methods of use either
do not infringe the patent claims of the relevant patent and/or that the patent claims are invalid, and we may not be able to do this.
Proving invalidity, in particular, is difficult since it requires a showing of clear and convincing evidence to overcome the presumption
of validity enjoyed by issued patents. 

Because
some patent applications in the United States may be maintained in secrecy until the patents are issued, patent applications in the United
States and many foreign jurisdictions are typically not published until eighteen months after filing, and publications in the scientific
literature often lag behind actual discoveries, we cannot be certain that others have not filed patent applications for technology covered
by our issued patents or our pending applications or that we were the first to invent the technology. Our competitors may have filed,
and may in the future file, patent applications covering technology similar to ours. Any such patent application may have priority over
our patent applications and could further require us to obtain rights to issued patents covering such technologies. If another party
has filed a United States patent application on inventions similar to ours, we may have to participate in an interference proceeding
declared by the PTO, to determine priority of invention in the United States. The costs of these proceedings could be substantial, and
it is possible that such efforts would be unsuccessful, resulting in a loss of our United States patent position with respect to such
inventions. 

Some
of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of complex patent litigation more effectively than we can because they have substantially
greater resources. In addition, any uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of any litigation could have a material
adverse effect on our ability to raise the funds necessary to continue our operations. 

29 

Third
parties may claim that we infringe their proprietary rights and may prevent us from manufacturing and selling some of our products. 

Our
manufacture, use and sale of SDC-based products may subject us to lawsuits relating to the validity and infringement of patents or other
proprietary rights of third parties. Litigation may be costly and time-consuming, and could divert the attention of our management and
technical personnel. If we are found to have violated the trademark, trade secret, copyright, patent or other intellectual property or
proprietary rights of others, such a finding could result in the need to cease use of a trademark, trade secret, copyrighted work or
patented invention in our business and our obligation to pay a substantial amount for past infringement. If the rights holders are willing
to permit us to continue to use their intellectual property rights, it may be necessary for us to enter into license arrangements with
unfavorable terms and pay substantial amounts in royalty and other license fees. Either having to cease use or pay such fees could prevent
us, or our third-party manufacturer, from manufacturing and selling our products, which could make us much less competitive in our industry
and have a material adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial condition. 

Confidentiality
agreements with employees and others may not adequately prevent disclosure of our trade secrets and other proprietary information and
may not adequately protect our intellectual property, which could limit our ability to compete. 

We
may rely in part on trade secret protection in order to protect our proprietary trade secrets and unpatented know-how. However, trade
secrets are difficult to protect, and we cannot be certain that others will not develop the same or similar technologies on their own.
We have taken steps, including entering into confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, outside scientific collaborators,
sponsored researchers and other advisors, to protect our trade secrets and unpatented know-how. These agreements generally require that
the other party keep confidential and not disclose to third parties all confidential information developed by the party or made known
to the party by us during the course of the party s relationship with us. We also typically obtain agreements from these parties
which provide that inventions conceived by the party in the course of rendering services to us will be our exclusive property. However,
these agreements may not be honored and may not effectively assign intellectual property rights to us. Enforcing a claim that a party
illegally obtained and is using our trade secrets or know-how is difficult, expensive and time consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable.
In addition, courts outside the United States may be less willing to protect trade secrets or know-how. The failure to obtain or maintain
trade secret protection could adversely affect our competitive position. 

We
may be subject to claims that our employees have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged trade secrets of their former employers. 

As
is common in the biotechnology, food, chemical and pharmaceutical industries, we employ individuals who were previously employed at other
biotechnology, food, chemical or pharmaceutical companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. Although no claims against
us are currently pending, we may be subject to claims that these employees or we have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed trade
secrets or other proprietary information of their former employers. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. Even
if we are successful in defending against these claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management. 

Risks
Related to our Common Stock 

The
price of our common stock may be volatile. 

Our
common stock is approved for quotation on the OTC Markets OTCQB marketplace under the symbol PURE. The OTCQB is
a regulated quotation service that displays real-time quotes, last-sale prices and volume information in over-the-counter equity securities
and provides significantly less liquidity than a listing on the Nasdaq Stock Markets or other national securities exchange. The OTCQB
securities are traded by a community of market makers that enter quotes and trade reports. This market is limited in comparison to the
national stock exchanges and any prices quoted may not be a reliable indication of the value of our common stock. Quotes for stocks included
on the OTCQB are not listed in the financial sections of newspapers as are those for the Nasdaq Stock Market or the NYSE. Therefore,
prices for securities traded solely on the OTCQB may be difficult to obtain. 

Trading
on the OTCQB Marketplace as opposed to a national securities exchange has resulted and may continue to result in a reduction in some
or all of the following, each of which could have a material adverse effect on the price of our common stock and our company: 

the
 liquidity of our common stock; 

the
 market price of shares of our common stock; 

our
 ability to obtain financing to support our operations and the implementation of our business plan; 

the
 number of institutional and other investors that will consider investing in shares of our common stock; 

the
 number of market markers in shares of our common stock; 

the
 availability of information concerning the trading prices and volume of shares of our common stock; and 

the
 number of broker-dealers willing to execute trades in shares of our common stock. 

30 

The
price and trading volume of our common stock have historically been volatile. 

In
addition, the market price and trading volume of our common stock may be subject to wide fluctuations in the future in response to: 

actual
 or anticipated fluctuations in our results of operations; 

announcements
 regarding the status of our regulatory efforts; 

the
 determination that our shares of common stock are penny stock which will require brokers trading in our shares of common
 stock to adhere to more stringent rules, likely resulting in a reduced level of trading activity in the secondary trading market
 for our shares of common stock; 

the
 sale by us of our common or preferred stock or other securities, or the anticipation of sales of such securities; 

the
 trading volume of our common stock, particularly if such volume is light; 

the
 introduction of new products or services, or product or service enhancements by us or our competitors; 

developments
 with respect to our or our competitors intellectual property rights or regulatory approvals or denials; 

announcements
 of significant acquisitions or other agreements by us or our competitors; 

sales
 or anticipated sales of our common stock by our insiders (management and directors); 

conditions
 and trends in our industry; 

changes
 in our pricing policies or the pricing policies of our competitors; 

changes
 in the estimation of the future size and growth of our markets; and 

general
 economic conditions. 

In
addition, the stock market in general, the OTCQB, and the market for shares of novel technology companies in particular, have experienced
extreme price and volume fluctuations that in some cases may be unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies.
These broad market and industry factors may materially harm the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance.
In addition, this volatility could adversely affect an investor s ability to sell shares of our common stock, and/or the available
price for such shares, at any given time. 

Potential
sales or issuances of our common stock to raise capital, or the perception that such sales could occur, could cause dilution to our current
stockholders and the price of our common stock to fall. 

We
have historically supported our operations through the issuance of equity securities and may continue to do so in the future. For example,
during October 2019 and March 2020, we completed two closings of a private placement financings to accredited investors, in which we
raised net proceeds of approximately 2,830,000 in the Closings and issued an aggregate of 9,758,619 shares of our common stock at a
purchase price of 0.29 per share. Although we may not be successful in obtaining financing through equity sales on terms that are favorable
to us in the future, if at all, any such sales that do occur could result in substantial dilution to the interests of existing holders
of our common stock. Additionally, the sale of a substantial number of shares of our common stock or other equity securities to any new
investors, or the anticipation of such sales, could cause the trading price of our common stock to fall. 

Our
common stock is deemed to be penny stock, which may make it more difficult for investors to sell their shares due to suitability
requirements. 

Shares
of our common stock are subject to the so-called penny stock rules as that term is defined in Rule 3a51-1 promulgated under
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These requirements may reduce the potential market for our common stock by reducing the number of
potential investors. This may make it more difficult for investors in our common stock to sell shares to third parties or to otherwise
dispose of them. This could cause our stock price to decline. 

Broker-dealers
dealing in penny stocks are required to provide potential investors with a document disclosing the risks of penny stock. Moreover, broker-dealers
are required to determine whether an investment in a penny stock is a suitable investment for a prospective investor. Such requirements
may discourage broker-dealers from effecting transactions in our common stock, which could limit the market price and liquidity of our
common stock. 

31 

We
have never paid dividends on our capital stock, and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. 

The
continued operation and expansion of our business will require substantial funding. Investors seeking cash dividends in the foreseeable
future should not purchase our common stock. We have paid no cash dividends on any of our capital stock to date and we currently intend
to retain our available cash to fund the development and growth of our business. Any determination to pay dividends in the future will
be at the discretion of our Board and will depend upon results of operations, financial condition, contractual restrictions, restrictions
imposed by applicable law and other factors our Board deems relevant. We do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock
in the foreseeable future. Any return to stockholders will therefore be limited to the appreciation of their stock, which may never occur. 

Anti-takeover
provisions under our charter documents and Delaware law could delay or prevent a change of control and could also limit the market price
of our stock. 

Certain
provisions of our charter and bylaws may delay or frustrate the removal of incumbent directors and may prevent or delay a merger, tender
offer, or proxy contest involving us that is not approved by our Board, even if such events may be beneficial to the interests of stockholders.
For example, our Board, without stockholder approval, has the authority and power to authorize the issuance of up to 5,000,000 shares
of preferred stock and such preferred stock could have voting or conversion rights that could adversely affect the voting power of the
holders of our common stock. Further, the one-for-eight reverse stock split of our outstanding common stock that we effected on August
14, 2012 has increased the proportion of unissued and authorized common shares to issued and outstanding common shares, which could allow
our Board to issue large numbers of additional shares of our common stock that could significantly reduce the voting power of our current
stockholders. In addition, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which may discourage,
delay or prevent certain business combinations with stockholders owning 15 or more of our outstanding voting stock. These and other
provisions in our charter documents may make it more difficult for stockholders or potential acquirers to initiate actions that are opposed
by our then-current board of directors, including delaying or impeding a merger, tender offer, or proxy contest or other change of control
transaction involving the Company. Any delay or prevention of a change of control transaction could cause stockholders to lose a substantial
premium over the then-current market price of their shares. 

General
Risk Factors 

Compliance
with the reporting requirements of federal securities laws can be expensive. 

We
are a public reporting company in the United States, and accordingly, subject to the information and reporting requirements of the Exchange
Act and other federal securities laws, including the compliance obligations of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The costs of complying with the
reporting requirements of the federal securities laws, including preparing and filing annual and quarterly reports and other information
with the SEC and furnishing audited reports to stockholders, can be substantial. 

If
we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may not be able to accurately determine our financial results or prevent
fraud. As a result, the Company s stockholders could lose confidence in our financial results, which could harm our business and
the value of the Company s common shares. 

Effective
internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and effectively prevent fraud. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act of 2002 requires us to evaluate and report on our internal controls over financial reporting. Our internal controls and financial
reporting are not subject to attestation by our independent registered public accounting firm pursuant to the exemption provided to issuers
that are not large accelerated filers or accelerated filers under the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010. We cannot be
certain that we will be successful in maintaining adequate internal controls over our financial reporting and financial processes in
the future. We may in the future discover areas of our internal controls that need improvement. Furthermore, to the extent our business
grows, our internal controls may become more complex, and we would require significantly more resources to ensure our internal controls
remain effective. If we or our independent auditors discover a material weakness, the disclosure of that fact, even if quickly remedied,
could reduce the market value of the Company s common stock. Additionally, the existence of any material weakness or significant
deficiency would require management to devote significant time and incur significant expense to remediate any such material weaknesses
or significant deficiencies and management may not be able to remediate any such material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in a
timely manner. 

We
are subject to tax audits by various tax authorities in multiple jurisdictions. 

From
time to time we may be audited by tax authorities to whom we are subject. Any assessment resulting from such audits, if any, could result
in material changes to our past or future taxable income, tax payable or deferred tax assets, and could require us to pay penalties and
interest that could materially adversely affect our financial results.

Overview 

We
are focused on developing and commercializing proprietary antimicrobial products that provide safe and cost-effective solutions to the
health and environmental challenges of pathogen and hygienic control. Our technology platform is based on patented stabilized ionic silver,
and our initial products contain silver dihydrogen citrate, or SDC. SDC is a broad-spectrum, non-toxic antimicrobial agent, which offers
24-hour residual protection and formulates well with other compounds. As a platform technology, we believe SDC is distinguished from
existing products in the marketplace because of its superior efficacy, reduced toxicity, non-causticity and the inability of bacteria
to form a resistance to it. 

We
believe there is a significant market opportunity for our safe, non-toxic, non-caustic and effective SDC-based solutions. We currently
offer PURE Hard Surface as a food contact surface sanitizer and disinfectant to restaurant chains, food processors and
food transportation companies. We also offer PURE Control as a direct food contact processing aid. In addition to our
direct sales efforts with PURE Hard Surface and PURE Control, we market and sell our SDC-based products indirectly through third-party
distributors supporting various industries. 

Financial
Overview 

This
financial overview provides a general description of our revenue and expenses. 

Net
Product Sales 

We
contract manufacture and sell SDC-based products for end use, and as a raw material for manufacturing use. We recognize revenue when
we satisfy a performance obligation by transferring control of the promised goods or services to our customers, in an amount that reflects
the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. Any amounts received prior to satisfying revenue
recognition criteria are recorded as deferred revenue. See Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Revenue Recognition . 

Cost
of Goods Sold 

Cost
of goods sold for product sales includes direct and indirect costs to manufacture products, including materials consumed, manufacturing
overhead, shipping costs, salaries, benefits, reserved inventory, and related expenses of operations. Depreciation related to manufacturing
is systematically allocated to inventory produced, and expensed through cost of goods sold at the time inventory is sold. 

35 

Selling,
General and Administrative 

Selling,
general and administrative expense consists primarily of salaries and other related costs for personnel in business development, sales,
finance, accounting, information technology, and executive functions. Other selling, general and administrative costs include product
marketing, advertising, and trade show costs, as well as public relations and investor relations, facility costs, and legal, accounting
and other professional fees. 

Research
and Development 

Our
research and development activities are focused on leveraging our technology platform to develop additional proprietary products and
applications. Research and development expense consists primarily of personnel and related costs, product registration expenses, and
third-party testing. We expense research and development costs as incurred. 

Other
Income (Expense) 

We
record interest income, interest expense, the change in derivative liabilities, as well as other non-operating transactions, as other
income (expense) in our consolidated statements of operations. 

COVID-19 

The
COVID-19 pandemic has led to severe disruptions in general economic activities, as businesses and federal, state, and local governments
take increasingly broad actions to mitigate this public health crisis. While we have experienced some delays related to final third-party
validation of certain of our products and product rollouts by customers using PURE Control, we have not experienced a material disruption
to our business. In addition, we previously benefited from increased demand from our customers for our PURE Hard Surface product
due to a focus on surface disinfecting in response to attempting to prevent COVID-19 transmission. We subsequently experienced an
abatement in such demand and cannot assure you that demand will stabilize. Additionally, we are beginning to experience supply chain
issues with our various plastic packaging configurations and citric acid. Further, on a go-forward basis, we cannot guarantee the overall economic conditions will not affect our business, as these conditions
may significantly negatively impact all aspects of our business. Our business is dependent on the continued health and productivity of
our employees, including our sales staff and corporate management team. 

Additionally,
our liquidity could be negatively impacted if these conditions continue for a significant period of time and we may be required to pursue
additional sources of financing to obtain working capital, maintain appropriate inventory levels, and meet our financial obligations.
Currently, capital and credit markets have been disrupted by the crisis and our ability to obtain any required financing is not guaranteed
and largely dependent upon evolving market conditions and other factors. Depending on the continued impact of the crisis, further actions
may be required to improve our cash position and capital structure. 

The
extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic ultimately impacts our business, sales, results of operations and financial condition will depend
on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including, but not limited to, the duration and spread of
the outbreak, its severity, the actions to contain the virus or treat its impact, and how quickly and to what extent normal economic
and operating conditions resume and, more specifically, the effect it has on our customers and suppliers. Even after the COVID-19 pandemic
has subsided, we may experience significant impacts to our business as a result of its global economic impact, including any economic
downturn or recession that has occurred or may occur in the future. See the section titled Risk Factors - The currently evolving
situation related to the COVID-19 pandemic could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

Results
of Operations Comparison of the Years Ended July 31, 2021 and 2020 

Fluctuations
in Operating Results 

Our
results of operations have fluctuated significantly from period to period in the past and are likely to continue to do so in the future.
We anticipate that our results of operations will be affected for the foreseeable future by several factors that may contribute to these
periodic fluctuations, including fluctuations in the buying patterns of our current or potential customers for which we have no visibility,
the mix of product sales including a change in the percentage of higher or lower margin formulations and packaging configurations of
our products, the cost of product sales including component costs, our inability for any reason to be able to meet demand, the achievement
and timing of research and development and regulatory milestones, unforeseen changes in expenses, including non-cash expenses such as
the fair value of equity awards granted and the fair value change of derivative liabilities, the calculation of which includes several
variable assumptions, and unforeseen manufacturing or supply issues, among other issues. Due to these fluctuations, we believe that the
period-to-period comparisons of our operating results are not a reliable indication of our future performance. As of the date of this
filing, we are not aware of any trends in these factors or events or conditions that we believe are reasonably likely to impact our results
of operations in the future. 

Net
Product Sales 

Net
product sales were 3,698,000 and 6,917,000 for the years ended July 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. During the fourth quarter of the
prior year the Company experienced a significant increase in sales due to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, our year-over-year
product revenue decreased by 3,219,000. The decrease was attributable to decreased sales across our distribution network servicing the
food processing, transportation and janitorial industry. Our top three customers accounted for 1,560,000 of net product sales for the
year ended July 31, 2021. 

For
the year ended July 31, 2021, one customer accounted for 11 of our net product sales. No other individual customer accounted for 10 
or more of our net product sales. There were no foreign sales during the fiscal year ended July 31, 2021. 

For
the year ended July 31, 2020, three individual customers accounted for 16 , 13 and 11 of our net product sales. No other individual
customer accounted for 10 or more of our net product sales. The geographic breakdown of net product sales was as follows: 98 U.S. and
2 foreign. 

During
the fiscal year ended July 31, 2021, we recognized 229,000 in royalties from a nonexclusive third-party distributor. 

36 

Cost
of Goods Sold 

Cost
of goods sold was 1,852,000 and 2,896,000 for the years ended July 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The decrease of 1,044,000
was primarily attributable to decreased product sales. 

Gross
margin, as a percentage of net product sales, was 50 and 58 for the years ended July 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The decrease
in gross margin percentage was primarily attributable to the sale of higher margin formulations and packaging configurations of our products
during the fiscal year ended July 31, 2020 as compared with the current year. 

Selling,
General and Administrative Expense 

Selling,
general and administrative expense was 4,047,000 and 3,695,000 for the years ended July 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The
increase of 352,000 was primarily attributable to increased personnel costs, facilities expenses, as well as, increased board
fees and share-based compensation. These increases were partially offset by decreased professional service costs and legal fees. 

Share-based
compensation expense included in selling, general and administrative expense, was 841,000 and 787,000 for the fiscal year ended July
31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The increase of 54,000 is primarily due to the current year vesting of stock options and restricted
stock units granted to employees, directors and consultants supporting our selling, general and administrative functions. 

Research
and Development Expense 

Research
and development expense was 339,000 and 322,000 for the years ended July 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The increase of 17,000 was
primarily attributable to increased third-party testing and research supporting our FDA approval efforts. 

37 

Modified
EBITDA 

In
addition to our GAAP results, we present Modified EBITDA as a supplemental measure of our performance. However, Modified EBITDA is not
a recognized measurement under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net income, income from operations or any other
performance measure derived in accordance with GAAP, or as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities as a measure of liquidity.
We define Modified EBITDA as net income (loss), plus interest expense, depreciation and amortization and stock-based compensation expense. 

Management
considers our core operating performance to be that which our managers can affect in any particular period through their management of
the resources that affect our underlying revenue and profit generating operations during that period. Non-GAAP adjustments to our results
prepared in accordance with GAAP are itemized below. You are encouraged to evaluate these adjustments and the reasons we consider them
appropriate for supplemental analysis. In evaluating Modified EBITDA, you should be aware that in the future we may incur expenses that
are the same as or similar to some of the adjustments in this presentation. Our presentation of Modified EBITDA should not be construed
as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. 

Set
forth below is a reconciliation of net loss to Modified EBITDA for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2021 and 2020:

 Modified EBITDA

We
present Modified EBITDA because we believe it assists investors and analysts in comparing our performance across reporting periods on
a consistent basis by excluding items that we do not believe are indicative of our core operating performance. In addition, we use Modified
EBITDA in developing our internal budgets, forecasts and strategic plan; in analyzing the effectiveness of our business strategies in
evaluating potential acquisitions; making compensation decisions; and in communications with our board of directors concerning our financial
performance. Modified EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, which includes, among others, the following: 

Modified
 EBITDA does not reflect our cash expenditures, or future requirements, for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; 

Modified
 EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; 

Modified
 EBITDA does not reflect future interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments, on
 our debts; and 

Although
 depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in
 the future, and Modified EBITDA does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

As
of July 31, 2021, we had 2,465,000 in cash and cash equivalents compared with 3,914,000 in cash and cash equivalents as of July 31,
2020. The net decrease in cash and cash equivalents was primarily attributable to the use of cash to fund our operations and investments
in property, plant and equipment. Additionally, as of July 31, 2021, we had 970,000 of current liabilities, including 593,000 in accounts
payable, compared with 1,512,000 of current liabilities, including 1,344,000 in accounts payable as of July 31, 2020. The net decrease
in current liabilities was primarily due to trade payables due to our contract manufacture. 

We have a history of recurring losses, and
as of July 31, 2021 we have incurred a cumulative net loss of 125,800,000. During the fiscal year ended July 31, 2021, we recorded a
net loss of 2,319,000 on recorded net revenue of 3,927,000. In addition, during the year ended July 31, 2021 we used 1,688,000 in
operating and investing activities resulting in a cash balance of 2,390,000 as of July 31, 2021. Our history of recurring operating
losses, and negative cash flows from operating activities give rise to substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going
concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification
of assets or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that may result from our possible inability to continue as a going concern. 

Our
future capital requirements depend on numerous forward-looking factors. These factors may include, but are not limited to, the following:
the acceptance of, and demand for, our products; our success and the success of our partners in selling our products; our success and
the success of our partners in obtaining regulatory approvals to sell our products; the costs of further developing our existing products
and technologies; the extent to which we invest in new product and technology development; and the costs associated with the continued
operation, and any future growth, of our business. The outcome of these and other forward-looking factors will substantially affect our
liquidity and capital resources. 

Until
we can continually generate positive cash flow from operations, we will need to continue to fund our operations with the proceeds of
offerings of our equity and debt securities. However, we cannot assure you that additional financing will be available when needed or
that, if available, financing will be obtained on terms favorable to us or to our stockholders. If we raise additional funds from the
issuance of equity securities, substantial dilution to our existing stockholders would likely result. If we raise additional funds by
incurring debt financing, the terms of the debt may involve significant cash payment obligations as well as covenants and specific financial
ratios that may restrict our ability to operate our business.

Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates 

The
discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our audited consolidated financial statements,
which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP. The preparation of
these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues,
expenses, and related disclosures. We evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and
on other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments
about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from
these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 

We
believe the following accounting policies and estimates are critical to aid you in understanding and evaluating our reported financial
results. 

Revenue
Recognition 

Effective
August 1, 2018, we adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB Accounting Standards Codification ASC ),
Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers Topic 606 ). Under Topic 606, revenue is recognized at an amount that
reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for transferring goods or services to a customer. This principle
is applied using the following 5-step process: 

1. 
 Identify
 the contract with the customer 

2. 
 Identify
 the performance obligations in the contract 

3. 
 Determine
 the transaction price 

4. 
 Allocate
 the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract 

5. 
 Recognize
 revenue when (or as) each performance obligation is satisfied 

Under
Topic 606, we recognize revenue when we satisfy a performance obligation by transferring control of the promised goods or services to
our customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. 

Our
technology platform is based on patented stabilized ionic silver, and our initial products contain silver dihydrogen citrate, or SDC.
SDC is a broad-spectrum, non-toxic antimicrobial agent, which offers 24-hour residual protection and formulates well with other compounds.
We sell various configurations and dilutions of SDC direct to customers and through distributors. We currently offer PURE 
Hard Surface as a food contact surface sanitizer and disinfectant to restaurant chains, food processors and food transportation companies.
We also offer PURE Control as a direct food contact processing aid. 

Contract
terms for unit price, quantity, shipping and payment are governed by sales agreements and purchase orders which we consider to be a customer s
contract in all cases. The unit price is considered the observable stand-alone selling price for the arrangements. Any promotional or
sales discounts are applied evenly to the units sold for purposes of calculating standalone selling price. 

Product
sales generally consist of a single performance obligation that we satisfy at a point in time. We recognize product revenue when the
following events have occurred: (a) we have transferred physical possession of the products, (b) we have a present right to payment,
(c) the customer has legal title to the products, and (d) the customer bears significant risks and rewards of ownership of the products. 

Our
direct customer and distributer sales are invoiced based on received purchase orders. Our payment terms on invoiced direct customer and
distributor sales range between 30 and 90 days after we satisfy our performance obligation. The majority of our customers are on 30 day
payment terms. We currently offer no right of return on invoiced sales and maintain no allowance for sales returns. 

Shipping
and handling are treated as activities to fulfill promises to customers and any amounts billed to a customer, if applicable, represent
revenues earned for the goods provided. Costs related to such shipping and handling billings are classified as cost of sales. 

We
do not have significant categories of revenue that may impact how the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows
are affected by economic factors. 

39 

Variable
Consideration 

We
record revenue from customers in an amount that reflects the transaction price we expect to be entitled to after transferring control
of those goods or services. From time to time, we offer sales promotions on our products such as discounts. Variable consideration is
estimated at contract inception only to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal of revenue will not occur. 

Share-Based
Compensation 

We
grant equity-based awards under share-based compensation plans. We estimate the fair value of share-based payment awards using the Black-Scholes
option valuation model. This fair value is then amortized over the requisite service periods of the awards. The Black-Scholes option
valuation model requires the input of subjective assumptions, including price volatility of the underlying stock, risk-free interest
rate, dividend yield, and expected life of the option. Share-based compensation expense is based on awards ultimately expected to vest,
and therefore is reduced by expected forfeitures. Changes in assumptions used under the Black-Scholes option valuation model could materially
affect our net loss and net loss per share. 

Impairment
of Long-Lived Assets 

In
accordance with GAAP, if indicators of impairment exist, we assess the recoverability of the affected long-lived assets by determining
whether the carrying value of such assets can be recovered through undiscounted future operating cash flows. If impairment is indicated,
we measure the amount of such impairment by comparing the carrying value of the asset to the fair value of the asset and we record the
impairment as a reduction in the carrying value of the related asset and a charge to operating results. Estimating the undiscounted future
cash flows associated with long-lived assets requires judgment, and assumptions could differ materially from actual results. There were
no patent impairments during the fiscal years ended July 31, 2021 or 2020. 

For
purposes of testing impairment, we group our long-lived assets at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows independent
of other asset groups. Currently, there is only one level of aggregation for our intangible assets. We assess the impairment of long-lived
assets, consisting of property, plant, equipment and finite-lived intangible assets primarily consisting of the worldwide patent portfolio
of our silver ion technologies, annually, or whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Examples of such events or circumstances include: 

an
 asset group s inability to continue to generate income from operations and positive cash flow in future periods; 

loss
 of legal ownership or title to an asset; 

significant
 changes in our strategic business objectives and utilization of the asset(s); and 

the
 impact of significant negative industry or economic trends. 

40 

Additionally,
on a quarterly basis we review the significant assumptions underlying our impairment assessment to determine that our previous conclusions
remain valid. As part of our review, we consider changes in revenue growth rates, operating margins, working capital needs and other
expenditures. With the exception of the impairment discussed above we have not identified any asset groups where undiscounted cash flows
were not substantially in excess of carrying value. 

Recoverability
of assets to be held and used in operations is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to the future net cash flows
expected to be generated by the assets. The factors used to evaluate the future net cash flows, while reasonable, require a high degree
of judgment and the results could vary if the actual results are materially different than the forecasts. In addition, we base useful
lives and amortization or depreciation expense on our subjective estimate of the period that the assets will generate revenue or otherwise
be used by us. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying
amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount
or fair value less selling costs. 

We
also periodically review the lives assigned to our intangible assets to ensure that our initial estimates do not exceed any revised estimated
periods from which we expect to realize cash flows from the technologies. If a change were to occur in any of the above-mentioned factors
or estimates, the likelihood of a material change in our reported results would increase.

Item
7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 

As
a Smaller Reporting Company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and in Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K, we are electing scaled
disclosure reporting obligations and therefore are not required to provide the information requested by this Item. 

Item
8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data 

The
consolidated financial statements and supplementary data required by this Item 8 are set forth at the end of this Annual Report. 

Item
9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure 

Not
applicable. 

Item
9A. Controls and Procedures 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

We
maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our Exchange Act
reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that
such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial
Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls
and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable
assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. 

As
required by Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act, our management conducted an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation
of our Principal Executive Officer and our Principal Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure
controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report. Based on the foregoing evaluation, our principal executive
officer and principal financial officer concluded that as of the end of the period covered by this report our disclosure controls and
procedures were effective. 

Changes
in Our Internal Controls over Financial Reporting 

There
were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting during our most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected,
or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal controls over financial reporting. 

Management s
Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Exchange
Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f). With the participation of our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, management
conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control
- Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on its evaluation
under this framework, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of July 31, 2021. 

42 

Inherent
Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls 

Our
management, including our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, do not expect that our disclosure controls or
our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed
and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system s objectives will be met. The design
of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative
to their costs. Further, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance
that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected.
These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because
of simple error or mistake. Controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people,
or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood
of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future
conditions. Projections of any evaluation of controls effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks. Over time, controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures.

Corporate
Governance 

Overview 

We
are committed to maintaining high standards of business conduct and corporate governance, which we believe are fundamental to the overall
success of our business, serving our stockholders well and maintaining our integrity in the marketplace. Our Corporate Governance Guidelines
and Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, together with our Certificate of Incorporation, Bylaws and the charters of our Board Committees,
form the basis for our corporate governance framework. As discussed below, our Board of Directors has established two standing committees
to assist it in fulfilling its responsibilities to the Company and its stockholders: the Audit Committee and the Compensation Committee.
The Board of Directors performs the functions typically assigned to a Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. 

Corporate
Governance Guidelines 

Our
Corporate Governance Guidelines are designed to ensure effective corporate governance of our Company. Our Corporate Governance Guidelines
cover topics including, but not limited to, director qualification criteria, director responsibilities, director compensation, director
orientation and continuing education, communications from stockholders to the Board, succession planning and the annual evaluations of
the Board and its Committees. Our Corporate Governance Guidelines are reviewed regularly by the Board and revised when appropriate. The
full text of our Corporate Governance Guidelines can be found in the Corporate Governance section of our website accessible
at www.purebio.com . A printed copy may also be obtained by any stockholder upon request to our Corporate Secretary. 

Code
of Business Conduct and Ethics 

We
have adopted a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics that applies to all of our employees, officers and directors. This Code constitutes
a code of ethics as defined by the rules of the SEC. This Code also contains whistle blower procedures adopted
by our Audit Committee regarding the receipt, retention and treatment of complaints related to accounting, internal accounting controls
or auditing matters and procedures for confidential anonymous employee complaints related to questionable accounting or auditing matters.
Copies of the code may be obtained free of charge from our website, www.purebio.com . Any amendments to, or waivers from, a provision
of our code of ethics that applies to any of our executive officers will be posted on our website in accordance with the rules of the
SEC. Other than as specifically referenced herein, the information contained on, or that can be accessed through, our website is not
a part of this Report. 

45 

Director
Independence 

We
are not currently listed on any national securities exchange or in an inter-dealer quotation system that has established a standard for
independence. However, in evaluating the independence of our members and the composition of the committees of our Board of Directors,
our Board utilizes the definition of independence as that term is defined by applicable listing standards of the NYSE MKT.
As of the date hereof, our Board consists of three members, two of whom are considered independent as that term is defined by applicable
listing standards of the NYSE MKT. Our independent directors include: Messrs. Chen and Rendall and Ms. Taylor. 

Board
and Committee Attendance 

During
the fiscal year ended July 31, 2021, the Board of Directors met two times and it took action by unanimous written consent two times.
During the fiscal year ended July 31, 2021 our Audit Committee met four times. Each of the directors attended 100 of the meetings of
the Board of Directors. 

Director
Attendance at Annual Meeting 

We
believe the annual meeting of stockholders provides a good opportunity for our directors to hear any feedback the stockholders may share
with the Company at the meeting. As a result, we encourage our directors to attend our annual meeting. We reimburse our directors for
the reasonable expenses incurred by them in attending the annual meeting. 

Executive
Sessions 

Executive
sessions of our independent directors are held at each regularly scheduled meeting of our Board and at other times as necessary and are
chaired by the Chairman of the Board. The Board s policy is to hold executive sessions without the presence of management, including
our President and Chief Executive Officer, who is the only non-independent director on the Board. Our Board Committees also generally
meet in executive session at the end of each committee meeting. 

Board
Committees 

Compensation
Committee . The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors currently consists of Messrs. Chen (Chair) and Rendall and Ms. Taylor.
The functions of the Compensation Committee include the approval of the compensation offered to our executive officers and recommending
to the full Board of Directors the compensation to be offered to our directors, including our Chairman. The Board has determined that
Messrs. Chen and Rendall and Ms. Taylor are each an independent director under the listing standards of the NYSE MKT. In
addition, the members of the Compensation Committee qualify as a non-employee directors for purposes of Rule 16b-3 under
the Exchange Act and as an outside director for purposes of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.
The Compensation Committee is governed by a written charter approved by the Board of Directors, a copy of which is available on our website
at www.purebio.com . 

Audit
Committee . The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, currently consists of Messrs. Chen (Chair) and Rendall and Ms. Taylor.
The functions of the Audit Committee include the retention of our independent registered public accounting firm, reviewing and approving
the planned scope, proposed fee arrangements and results of the Company s annual audit, reviewing the adequacy of the Company s
accounting and financial controls and reviewing the independence of the Company s independent registered public accounting firm.
The Board has determined that Messrs. Chen and Rendall and Ms. Taylor are independent director under the listing standards
of the NYSE MKT. The Board of Directors has also determined that Messrs. Chen and Rendall and Ms. Taylor are each an audit committee
financial expert within the applicable definition of the SEC. The Audit Committee is governed by a written charter approved by
the Board of Directors, a copy of which is available on our website at www.purebio.com . 

Nominating
Committee . The Board has not established a Nominating Committee, and as a result performs the functions typically assigned to a Nominating
Committee, including the identification, recruitment and nomination of candidates for the Board and its committees, determining the structure,
composition and functioning of the Board and its committees including the reporting channels through which the Board receives information
and the quality and timeliness of the information, developing and recommending to the Board corporate governance guidelines applicable
to the Company and annually reviewing and recommending changes, as necessary or appropriate, overseeing the annual evaluation of the
Board s effectiveness and performance. 

46 

Board
and Committee Effectiveness 

The
Board and each of its Committees performs an annual self-assessment to evaluate their effectiveness in fulfilling their obligations.
The Board and Committee evaluations cover a wide range of topics, including, among others, the fulfillment of the Board and Committee
responsibilities identified in the Corporate Governance Guidelines and charters for each Committee. 

Board
Leadership Structure 

Our
Bylaws provide our Board with flexibility to combine or separate the positions of Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer in
accordance with its determination that utilizing one or the other structure would be in the best interests of our company. At the current
time, Mr. Chen serves as our Chairman of the Board, and Mr. Lee serves as our Chief Executive Officer. Our Board believes our leadership
structure enhances the accountability of our Chief Executive Officer to the Board and encourages balanced decision making. In addition,
the Board believes that this structure provides an environment in which its independent directors are fully informed, have significant
input into the content of Board meetings and are able to provide objective and thoughtful oversight of management. Our Board also separated
the roles in recognition of the differences in responsibilities. While our Chief Executive Officer is responsible for the day-to-day
leadership of the Company and its business operations, the Chairman of the Board provides guidance to the Board, sets the agenda for
Board meetings and presides over the meetings of the full Board and the meetings of the Board s non-management directors. The Board
Chairman also provides performance feedback on behalf of the Board to our Chief Executive Officer. The Board intends to carefully evaluate
from time to time whether our Chief Executive Officer and Chairman positions should remain separate based on what the Board believes
is best for the Company and its stockholders. 

Board
Oversight of Risk 

The
Board is actively involved in the oversight of risks that could affect the Company. The Board as a whole has responsibility for risk
oversight of the Company s risk management policies and procedures, with reviews of certain areas being conducted by the relevant
Board committee. The Board satisfies this responsibility through reports by each Committee Chair regarding the Committee s considerations
and actions, as well as through regular reports directly from management responsible for oversight of particular risks within the Company.
Specifically, the Board committees address the following risk areas: 

The
 Compensation Committee is responsible for overseeing the management of risks related to the Company s executive compensation
 plans and arrangements. 

The
 Audit Committee discusses with management the Company s major financial and other risk exposures and the steps management has
 taken to monitor and control such exposures. 

The
Board as a whole considers risks related to regulatory and compliance matters as well as risks related to the Company s sales and
marketing and research and development initiatives. 

The
Board encourages management to promote a corporate culture that incorporates risk management into the Company s day-to-day business
operations. 

Stockholder
Recommendations for Director Nominees 

In
nominating candidates for election as a director, the Board will consider a reasonable number of candidates recommended by a single stockholder
who has held over 20 of PURE Bioscience Common Stock for over one year and who satisfies the notice, information and consent provisions
set forth in our Bylaws and Corporate Governance Guidelines. Stockholders who wish to recommend a candidate may do so by writing to the
Board of Directors in care of the Corporate Secretary, PURE Bioscience, Inc., 9669 Hermosa Avenue, Rancho Cucamonga, California 91730.
The Board of Directors will use the same evaluation process for director nominees recommended by stockholders as it uses for other director
nominees. A printed copy of our Bylaws may be obtained by any stockholder upon request to our Corporate Secretary.

Identification
and Evaluation of Director Nominees 

In
evaluating nominees for membership on our Board, our Board applies the Board membership criteria set forth in our Corporate Governance
Guidelines. Under these criteria, the Board takes into account many factors, including an individual s business experience and
skills (including skills in core areas such as operations, management, technology, accounting and finance, strategic planning and international
markets), as well as independence, judgment, knowledge of our business and industry, professional reputation, leadership, integrity and
ability to represent the best interests of the Company s stockholders. In addition, the Board also considers the ability to commit
sufficient time and attention to the activities of the Board, as well as the absence of any potential conflicts with the Company s
interests. The Board does not assign specific weights to particular criteria and no particular criterion is necessarily applicable to
all prospective nominees. The Board does not have a formal policy with respect to diversity of nominees. Rather, our Board considers
Board membership criteria as a whole and seeks to achieve diversity of occupational and personal backgrounds on the Board. 

Our
Board regularly assesses the appropriate size of our Board, and whether any vacancies on our Board are expected due to retirement or
otherwise. In the event that vacancies are anticipated, or otherwise arise, the Board will consider various potential candidates who
may come to the attention of the Board through current Board members, professional search firms, stockholders or other persons. Each
candidate brought to the attention of the Board, regardless of who recommended such candidate, is considered on the basis of the criteria
set forth in our corporate governance guidelines. As stated above, our Board will consider candidates proposed for nomination by our
significant stockholders. Stockholders may propose candidates by submitting the names and supporting information to: Corporate Secretary,
PURE Bioscience, Inc., 9669 Hermosa Avenue, Rancho Cucamonga, California 91730. Supporting information should include (a) the name and
address of the candidate and the proposing stockholder, (b) a comprehensive biography of the candidate and an explanation of why the
candidate is qualified to serve as a director taking into account the criteria identified in our corporate governance guidelines, (c)
proof of ownership, the class and number of shares, and the length of time that the shares of our voting securities have been beneficially
owned by each of the candidate and the proposing stockholder, and (d) a letter signed by the candidate stating his or her willingness
to serve, if elected.

Narrative
to Summary Compensation Table 

The
compensation program established for the Company s executive officers consisted of the following elements: 

Base
Salary : The base salaries of our named executive officers depend on their job responsibilities, the market rate of compensation
paid by companies in our industry for similar positions, our financial position and performance, and the strength of our business. Base
salaries provide a fixed means of compensation in order to attract and retain talent. Mr. Lee received no base salary as Chief Executive
Officer during the fiscal year ended July 31, 2021. Mr. Elliott s salary was 162,000 per year during the fiscal year ended July
31, 2021. The base salary for Mr. Myers was 200,000 per year during the fiscal year ended July 31, 2021. 

Performance-Based
Cash Awards : As part of the Company s executive compensation program, our executive officers are eligible to receive performance-based
cash awards. The annual performance-based cash awards are based on the executive officer s individual performance and the Company s
actual performance compared to the corporate goals approved by the Board and the Compensation Committee. Following the end of each fiscal
year, the Board and the Compensation Committee is responsible for determining the bonus amount payable to an executive officer based
on that executive officer s individual performance during the fiscal year and its determination of the Company s actual performance
compared to the corporate goals established for that fiscal year. Due to the Company s limited financial resources and performance,
our named executive officers did not receive any performance-based cash bonuses for the years ended July 31, 2021 and 2020. 

Long-Term
Equity Awards : Equity ownership by our executive officers and key employees encourages them to create long-term value and aligns
their interests with those of our stockholders. As a result, our executive compensation program provides for the issuance of stock options
and restricted stock units RSUs as determined by the Compensation Committee and our Board.

Code
Section 162(m) Provisions 

Section
162(m) of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code, or the Code, generally disallows a tax deduction to public companies for compensation in excess
of 1 million paid to the Chief Executive Officer or any of the four most highly compensated officers. Prior to changes in tax law taking
effect in 2018, there was an exception to the 1.0 million limitation for performance-based compensation, including stock options, meeting
certain requirements. Before such amendments we had not adopted a policy that all compensation must qualify as deductible under Section
162(m) of the Code. The exemption from the Section 162(m) deduction limit for performance-based compensation has been repealed, effective
for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017, such that compensation paid to our Chief Executive Officer and certain other executive
officers in excess of 1.0 million will not be deductible unless it qualifies for transition relief applicable to certain arrangements
in place as of November 2, 2017.

Item
12. Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management and Related Stockholder Matters 

The
following table provides information regarding the beneficial ownership of our common stock as of October 28, 2021, or the Evaluation
Date, by: (i) each of our current directors, (ii) each of our named executive officers as set forth in Item 11 of this Annual Report,
(iii) all such directors and executive officers as a group and (iv) our five percent or greater stockholders. The table is based upon
information supplied by our officers, directors and principal stockholders and a review of Schedules 13D and 13G, if any, filed with
the SEC. Unless otherwise indicated in the footnotes to the table and subject to community property laws where applicable, we believe
that each of the stockholders named in the table has sole voting and investment power with respect to the shares indicated as beneficially
owned. 

Applicable
percentages are based on 87,223,141 shares outstanding as of the Evaluation Date, adjusted as required by rules promulgated by
the SEC. These rules generally attribute beneficial ownership of securities to persons who possess sole or shared voting power or investment
power with respect to those securities. In addition, the rules include shares of our common stock issuable pursuant to the exercise of
stock options or warrants or settlement of restricted stock units that are either immediately exercisable or exercisable within 60 days
of the Evaluation Date. These shares are deemed to be outstanding and beneficially owned by the person holding those securities for the
purpose of computing the percentage ownership of that person, but they are not treated as outstanding for the purpose of computing the
percentage ownership of any other person.

Section
16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance 

Section

who beneficially own more than 10 of our Common Stock to file initial reports of beneficial ownership and reports of changes in beneficial
ownership with the SEC. Such persons are required by SEC regulations to furnish us with copies of all Section 16(a) forms filed by such
persons.

the Company s knowledge, other than as described above, no person who, during the fiscal year ended July 31, 2021, was a director
or officer of the Company, or beneficial owner of more than ten percent of the Company s Common Stock (which is the only class
of securities of the Company registered under Section 12 of the Act), failed to file on a timely basis reports required by Section 16
of the Act during such fiscal year. 

Equity
Compensation Plan Information 

2007
Equity Incentive Plan 

In

the number of shares of common stock issuable under the 2007 Plan by 4,000,000 shares and extend the term of the 2007 Plan until February
4, 2026. The 2007 Plan provides for the grant of incentive and non-qualified stock options, as well as other share-based payment awards,
to our employees, directors, consultants and advisors. These awards have up to a 10-year contractual life and are subject to various
vesting periods, as determined by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. 

2017
Equity Incentive Plan 

In
January 2021, we amended and restated our 2017 Equity Incentive Plan, the 2017 Plan ), to, among other changes, increase

to our employees, directors, consultants and advisors. These awards have up to a 10-year contractual life and are subject to various
vesting periods, as determined by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. 

All
of our equity incentive plans are administered by the Compensation Committee. The exercise price for stock options is always at or above
the fair market value of our common stock on the date the award is granted. Fair market value is defined by the Plan and is based on
prevailing market prices of our common stock as reported by the OTCQB. The term of stock options granted and their vesting schedules
are determined by the Compensation Committee, subject to any limitations defined in the Plan. The Compensation Committee also determines
the vesting of other, non-option, stock awards.

REPORT
OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

To
the Stockholders and Board of Directors 

 Pure
Bioscience Inc. 

 Rancho
Cucamonga, Ca. 

Opinion
on the Financial Statements 

We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Pure Bioscience Inc. (the Company and Subsidiaries as of
July 31, 2021 and 2020, and the related statements of operations, stockholders equity, and cash flows for the years then ended,
and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements ). In our opinion, the financial statements
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of July 31, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its
operations and its cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America. 

Going
Concern 

The
accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed
in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has suffered recurring losses from operations and negative cash flows
from operating activities that raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management s plans in
regard to these matters are also described in Note 1. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might
result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

Basis
for Opinion 

These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s
financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal
securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company
is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits
we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion
on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our
audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error
or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

Critical
Audit Matter 

The
critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated
or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial
statements and (2) involved especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. 

The
communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole,
and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matter or on the
accounts or disclosures to which it relates. 

Evaluation of slow-moving and obsolete inventories at net realizable
value 

As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial
statements, the Company monitors inventory levels in order to identify slow-moving or obsolete merchandise as these factors can indicate
a decline in the market value of the inventory on hand. Inventory cost is reduced to net realizable value when cost exceeds the market
value less the cost of disposal. The market value is subject to the effects of consumer demands, customer preferences, and the broader
economy. The Company s inventory balance was 332,000 as of July 31, 2021 which represents 7.7 of total assets. 

The principal considerations for our determination
that performing procedures relating to the excess and obsolete inventory reserve is a critical audit matter are there was significant
judgment by management in estimating the excess and obsolete inventory reserve, which in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment,
subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and evaluating the reasonableness of the significant assumptions used in developing
the reserve, including the estimated reserve percentages. 

Addressing the matter involved performing procedures
and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures
included, among others, testing management s process for developing the excess and obsolete inventory reserve; evaluating the appropriateness
of the approach; testing the completeness and accuracy of underlying data used in the approach, including historical usage and inventory
age; and evaluating the reasonableness of the estimated reserve percentages used by management to determine the excess and obsolete inventory
reserve. 

We
have served as the Company s auditor since 2019.

 Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements 

1.
Organization and Business 

All
references to PURE, we , our, and us refer to PURE Bioscience, Inc. and our wholly
owned subsidiary. 

PURE
Bioscience, Inc. is focused on developing and commercializing our proprietary antimicrobial products that provide solutions to the health
and environmental challenges of pathogen and hygienic control. Our technology platform is based on patented stabilized ionic silver,
and our initial products contain silver dihydrogen citrate, or SDC. SDC is a broad-spectrum, non-toxic antimicrobial agent that is manufactured
as a liquid delivered in various concentrations. We currently distribute and contract the manufacture and distribution of our SDC-based
disinfecting and sanitizing products. We also contract manufacture and sell SDC-based formulations to manufacturers for use as a raw
material ingredient in the production of personal care products. We believe our technology platform has potential application in a number
of industries. We intend to focus our current resources on providing food safety solutions to the food industry. 

We
were incorporated in the state of California in August 1992 as Innovative Medical Services. In September 2003, we changed our name to
PURE Bioscience. In March 2011, we reincorporated in the state of Delaware. We operate in one business segment. 

Liquidity
and Going Concern 

We have a history of recurring losses, and
as of July 31, 2021 we have incurred a cumulative net loss of 125,800,000. During the fiscal year ended July 31, 2021, we recorded a
net loss of 2,319,000 on recorded net revenue of 3,927,000. In addition, during the year ended July 31, 2021 we used 1,688,000 in
operating and investing activities resulting in a cash balance of 2,390,000 as of July 31, 2021. Our history of recurring operating
losses, and negative cash flows from operating activities give rise to substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going
concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification
of assets or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that may result from our possible inability to continue as a going concern. 

Our
future capital requirements depend on numerous forward-looking factors. These factors may include, but are not limited to, the following:
the acceptance of, and demand for, our products; our success and the success of our partners in selling our products; our success and
the success of our partners in obtaining regulatory approvals to sell our products; the costs of further developing our existing products
and technologies; the extent to which we invest in new product and technology development; and the costs associated with the continued
operation, and any future growth, of our business. The outcome of these and other forward-looking factors will substantially affect our
liquidity and capital resources. 

Until
we can continually generate positive cash flow from operations, we will need to continue to fund our operations with the proceeds of
offerings of our equity and debt securities. However, we cannot ensure that additional financing will be available when needed or that,
if available, financing will be obtained on terms favorable to us or to our stockholders. If we raise additional funds from the issuance
of equity securities, substantial dilution to our existing stockholders would likely result. If we raise additional funds by incurring
debt financing, the terms of the debt may involve significant cash payment obligations as well as covenants and specific financial ratios
that may restrict our ability to operate our business.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 

Basis
of Presentation 

The
accompanying consolidated financial statements include the consolidated accounts of PURE Bioscience, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiary,
ETIH2O Inc., a Nevada corporation. ETIH2O Inc. has no business and no material assets or liabilities and there have been no significant
transactions related to ETIH2O Inc. during the periods presented in the consolidated financial statements. All inter-company balances
and transactions have been eliminated. 

Revenue
Recognition 

Effective
August 1, 2018, we adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB Accounting Standards Codification ASC ),
Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers Topic 606 ). Under Topic 606, revenue is recognized at an amount that
reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for transferring goods or services to a customer. This principle
is applied using the following 5-step process: 

1. 
 Identify
 the contract with the customer 

2. 
 Identify
 the performance obligations in the contract 

3. 
 Determine
 the transaction price 

4. 
 Allocate
 the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract 

5. 
 Recognize
 revenue when (or as) each performance obligation is satisfied 

Under
Topic 606, we recognize revenue when we satisfy a performance obligation by transferring control of the promised goods or services to
our customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. 

Our
technology platform is based on patented stabilized ionic silver, and our initial products contain silver dihydrogen citrate, or SDC.
SDC is a broad-spectrum, non-toxic antimicrobial agent, which offers 24-hour residual protection and formulates well with other compounds.
We sell various configurations and dilutions of SDC direct to customers and through distributors. We currently offer PURE 
Hard Surface as a food contact surface sanitizer and disinfectant to restaurant chains, food processors and food transportation companies.
We also offer PURE Control as a direct food contact processing aid. 

Contract
terms for unit price, quantity, shipping and payment are governed by sales agreements and purchase orders which we consider to be a customer s
contract in all cases. The unit price is considered the observable stand-alone selling price for the arrangements. Any promotional or
sales discounts are applied evenly to the units sold for purposes of calculating standalone selling price. 

Product
sales generally consist of a single performance obligation that we satisfy at a point in time. We recognize product revenue when the
following events have occurred: (a) we have transferred physical possession of the products, (b) we have a present right to payment,
(c) the customer has legal title to the products, and (d) the customer bears significant risks and rewards of ownership of the products. 

Our
direct customer and distributor sales are invoiced based on received purchase orders. Our payment terms on invoiced direct customer and
distributor sales range between 30 and 90 days after we satisfy our performance obligation. The majority of our customers are on 30 day
payment terms. We currently offer no right of return on invoiced sales and maintain no allowance for sales returns. 

Shipping
and handling are treated as activities to fulfill promises to customers and any amounts billed to a customer, if applicable, represent
revenues earned for the goods provided. Costs related to such shipping and handling billings are classified as cost of sales. 

We
do not have significant categories of revenue that may impact how the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows
are affected by economic factors. 

A
summary of our revenue by product type for the fiscal years ended July 31, 2021 and 2020 is as follows:

F- 8 

Variable
Consideration 

We
record revenue from customers in an amount that reflects the transaction price we expect to be entitled to after transferring control
of those goods or services. From time to time, we offer sales promotions on our products such as discounts. Variable consideration is
estimated at contract inception only to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal of revenue will not occur. 

Use
of Estimates 

The
preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America, or GAAP, requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial
statements, and the disclosures made in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements. Actual results could differ
materially from those estimates. Those estimates and assumptions include estimates for reserves of uncollectible accounts, inventory
obsolescence, depreciable lives of property and equipment, analysis of impairments of recorded long-term tangible and intangible assets,
realization of deferred tax assets, accruals for potential liabilities and assumptions made in valuing stock instruments issued for services. 

Cash
and Cash Equivalents 

Cash
and cash equivalents consist of cash and highly liquid investments with original maturities from the purchase date of three months or
less. 

Restricted
Cash 

The
Company is required to maintain 75,000 in a restricted certificate of deposit account in order to fully collateralize four revolving
credit card accounts. 

Accounts
Receivable 

Trade
accounts receivable are recorded net of allowances for doubtful accounts. We evaluate the collectability of our trade accounts receivable
based on a number of factors. In circumstances where we becomes aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial
obligations to the Company, a specific reserve for bad debts is estimated and recorded, which reduces the recognized receivable to the
estimated amount the Company believes will ultimately be collected. In addition to specific customer identification of potential bad
debts, bad debt charges are recorded based on our historical losses and an overall assessment of past due trade accounts receivable outstanding.
The allowance for doubtful accounts was zero at July 31, 2021 and 2020. 

Inventories 

Inventories
are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, and net of a valuation allowance for potential excess or obsolete material.
Cost is determined using the average cost method. We regularly review our inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for excess
and obsolete inventory based primarily on our estimated forecast of product demand and our ability to sell the product(s) concerned.
Demand for our products can fluctuate significantly. Factors that could affect demand for our products include unanticipated changes
in consumer preferences, general market conditions or other factors, which may result in cancellations of advance orders or a reduction
in the rate of reorders placed by customers. Additionally, our management s estimates of future product demand may be inaccurate,
which could result in an understated or overstated provision required for excess and obsolete inventory. At July 31, 2021, the Company
determined that a reserve for inventory obsolescence of 150,000 was required. At July 31, 2020, management determined
that a reserve for inventory obsolescence was not required. 

Property,
Plant and Equipment 

Property,
plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the
estimated useful lives of the assets. The estimated useful lives of our property, plant, and equipment range from three to ten years.
Capitalized costs associated with leasehold improvements are depreciated over the lesser of the useful life of the asset or the remaining
life of the lease. Depreciation is generally included in selling, general and administrative expense. Depreciation related to manufacturing
is systematically allocated to inventory produced, and expensed through cost of goods sold at the time inventory is sold. 

Management
assesses the carrying value of property and equipment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may
not be recoverable. If there is indication of impairment, management prepares an estimate of future cash flows expected to result from
the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. If these cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset, an impairment
loss is recognized to write down the asset to its estimated fair value. For the years ended July 31, 2021 and 2020, Company Management
determined there were no indicators of impairment of its property and equipment. 

Patents 

We
have filed a number of patent applications with the United States Patent and Trademark Office and in foreign countries. Certain legal
and related costs incurred in connection with pending patent applications have been capitalized. Costs related to successful patent applications
are amortized over the lesser of the remaining useful life of the related technology or the remaining patent life, commencing on the
date the patent is issued. Capitalized costs related to patent applications are expensed in the period in which a determination is made
not to pursue such applications. 

F- 9 

Impairment
of Long-Lived Assets 

In
accordance with GAAP, if indicators of impairment exist, we assess the recoverability of the affected long-lived assets, including our
capitalized patent costs, by determining whether the carrying value of such assets can be recovered through undiscounted future operating
cash flows. If impairment is indicated, we measure the amount of such impairment by comparing the carrying value of the asset to the
fair value of the asset and we record the impairment as a reduction in the carrying value of the related asset and a charge to operating
results. Estimating the undiscounted future cash flows associated with long-lived assets requires judgment, and assumptions could differ
materially from actual results. There were no patent impairments during the years ended July 31, 2021 or 2020. 

Shipping
and Handling Costs 

Shipping
and handling costs incurred by us for product shipments are included in cost of goods sold. 

Research
and Development Costs 

Research
and development costs are expensed as incurred. 

Share-Based
Compensation 

We
periodically issue stock options and restricted stock awards to employees and non-employees in non-capital raising transactions for services
and for financing costs. We account for such grants issued and vesting to employees based on ASC 718, whereby the value of the award
is measured on the date of grant and recognized as compensation expense on the straight-line basis over the vesting period. 

We
estimate the fair value of share-based payment awards at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option valuation model. The Black-Scholes
option valuation model requires the input of subjective assumptions, including price volatility of the underlying stock, risk-free interest
rate, dividend yield, and expected life of the option. Share-based compensation expense is based on awards ultimately expected to vest,
and therefore is reduced by expected forfeitures. 

Fair
Value Measurements 

The
Company determines the fair value of its assets and liabilities based on the exchange price in U.S. dollars that would be received for
an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an
orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Valuation techniques used to measure fair value maximize the
use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. The Company uses a fair value hierarchy with three levels of inputs,
of which the first two are considered observable and the last unobservable, to measure fair value: 

Level
 1 Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. 

Level
 2 Inputs, other than Level 1, that are observable, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices for similar assets
 or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable
 market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. 

Level
 3 Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the
 assets or liabilities. 

The
carrying amounts of financial instruments such as cash, accounts receivable, inventories, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, approximate
the related fair values due to the short-term maturities of these instruments. 

Concentrations 

Gross
sales . For the year ended July 31, 2021, one individual customer accounted for 11 of our net product sales. No other individual
customer accounted for 10 or more of our net product sales. The geographic breakdown of net product sales was as follows: 100 U.S.
For the year ended July 31, 2020, three individual customers accounted for 16 , 13 and 11 of our net product sales. No other individual
customer accounted for 10 or more of our net product sales. The geographic breakdown of net product sales was as follows: 98 U.S. and
2 foreign. 

F- 10 

Accounts
receivable. As of July 31, 2021, we had accounts receivable from three customers that comprised 17 , 15 and 10 of total accounts
receivable, respectively. As of July 31, 2020, we had accounts receivable from three customers that comprised 21 , 16 and 11 of total
accounts receivable, respectively. 

Purchases.
 For the fiscal year ended July 31, 2021, one vendor accounted for 36 of our purchases. For the fiscal year ended July 31, 2020,
one vendor accounted for 54 of our purchases. 

Accounts
payable. As of July 31, 2021, one vendor accounted for 50 of the total trade accounts payable. As of July 31, 2020, one vendor accounted
for 66 of the total trade accounts payable. 

Income
Taxes 

We
recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and the amounts
at which they are carried in the financial statements based upon the enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences
are expected to reverse. A valuation allowance is established to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized. 

Income
(Loss) Per Share 

Basic
earnings (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders by the weighted-average number
of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing net income attributable to common
stockholders by the sum of the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period and the weighted-average number
of dilutive common share equivalents outstanding during the period, using the treasury stock method. Dilutive common share equivalents
are comprised of in-the-money stock options and restricted stock units, based on the average stock price for each period using the treasury
stock method. Since we incurred a loss for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2021 the number of shares issuable upon the exercise of stock
options, the vesting of restricted stock units, and the exercise of warrants, none of which are included in the computation of basic
net loss per common share, was 10,984,390. For the fiscal year ended July 31, 2020, the incremental dilutive common share equivalents
were 2,402,335. 

Segments 

We
operates in one segment for the manufacture and distribution of our products. In accordance with the Segment Reporting 
Topic of the ASC, our chief operating decision maker has been identified as the Chief Executive Officer and President, who reviews operating
results to make decisions about allocating resources and assessing performance for the entire Company. Existing guidance, which is based
on a management approach to segment reporting, establishes requirements to report selected segment information quarterly and to report
annually entity-wide disclosures about products and services, major customers, and the countries in which the entity holds material assets
and reports revenue. All material operating units qualify for aggregation under Segment Reporting due to their similar
customer base and similarities in: economic characteristics; nature of products and services; and procurement, manufacturing and distribution
processes. Since the Company operates in one segment, all financial information required by Segment Reporting can be found
in the accompanying financial statements 

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements 

In
June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Credit Losses - Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments ASC 326 ).
The standard significantly changes how entities will measure credit losses for most financial assets, including accounts and notes receivables.
The standard will replace today s incurred loss approach with an expected loss model , under which
companies will recognize allowances based on expected rather than incurred losses. Entities will apply the standard s provisions
as a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance is effective.
As small business filer, the standard will be effective for us for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15,
2022. The Company is currently assessing the impact of adopting this standard on the Company s financial statements and related
disclosures. 

In
August 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-06 ASU 2020-06 Debt Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic
470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging Contracts in Entity s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Accounting for Convertible Instruments
and Contracts in an Entity s Own Equity. ASU 2020-06 will simplify the accounting for convertible instruments by reducing
the number of accounting models for convertible debt instruments and convertible preferred stock. Limiting the accounting models will
result in fewer embedded conversion features being separately recognized from the host contract as compared with current GAAP. Convertible
instruments that continue to be subject to separation models are (1) those with embedded conversion features that are not clearly and
closely related to the host contract, that meet the definition of a derivative, and that do not qualify for a scope exception from derivative
accounting and (2) convertible debt instruments issued with substantial premiums for which the premiums are recorded as paid-in capital.
ASU 2020-06 also amends the guidance for the derivatives scope exception for contracts in an entity s own equity to reduce form-over-substance-based
accounting conclusions. ASU 2020-06 will be effective January 1, 2024, for the Company. Early adoption is permitted, but no earlier than
January 1, 2021, including interim periods within that year. Management is currently evaluating the effect of the adoption of ASU 2020-06
on the consolidated financial statements, but currently does not believe ASU 2020-06 will have a significant impact on the Company s
accounting. 

F- 11 

Recent
accounting pronouncements issued by the FASB, including its Emerging Issues Task Force, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants,
and the Securities and Exchange Commission did not or are not believed by management to have a material impact on the Company s
present or future consolidated financial statement presentation or disclosures.

Commitments and Contingencies 

COVID-19 

The
COVID-19 pandemic has led to severe disruptions in general economic activities, as businesses and federal, state, and local governments
take increasingly broad actions to mitigate this public health crisis. While we have experienced some delays related to final third-party
validation of certain of our products and product rollouts by customers using PURE Control, we have not experienced a material disruption
to our business. In addition, we previously benefited from increased demand from our customers for our PURE Hard Surface product
due to a focus on surface disinfecting in response to attempting to prevent COVID-19 transmission. We subsequently experienced an
abatement in such demand and cannot assure you that demand will stabilize. Additionally, we are beginning to experience supply chain
issues with our various plastic packaging configurations and citric acid. Further, on a go-forward basis, we cannot guarantee the
overall economic conditions will not affect our business, as these conditions may significantly negatively impact all aspects of our
business. Our business is dependent on the continued health and productivity of our employees, including our sales staff and corporate
management team. 

Additionally,
our liquidity could be negatively impacted if these conditions continue for a significant period of time and we may be required to pursue
additional sources of financing to obtain working capital, maintain appropriate inventory levels, and meet our financial obligations.
Currently, capital and credit markets have been disrupted by the crisis and our ability to obtain any required financing is not guaranteed
and largely dependent upon evolving market conditions and other factors. Depending on the continued impact of the crisis, further actions
may be required to improve our cash position and capital structure. 

The
extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic ultimately impacts our business, sales, results of operations and financial condition will depend
on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including, but not limited to, the duration and spread of
the outbreak, its severity, the actions to contain the virus or treat its impact, and how quickly and to what extent normal economic
and operating conditions resume and, more specifically, the effect it has on our customers and suppliers. Even after the COVID-19 pandemic
has subsided, we may experience significant impacts to our business as a result of its global economic impact, including any economic
downturn or recession that has occurred or may occur in the future. 

Legal 

From
time to time, we could become involved in disputes and various litigation matters that arise in the normal course of business. Lawsuits
against us or our officers or directors by employees, former employees, stockholders, partners, customers, or others, or actions taken
by regulatory authorities, could be very costly and substantially disrupt our business. Such lawsuits and actions are not uncommon, and
we may not be able to resolve such disputes or actions on terms favorable to us, and there may not be sufficient capital resources available
to defend such actions effectively, or at all. As of July 31, 2021, there were no material lawsuits against the Company. 

Manufacturing

ICC
 will invest in plant improvements to allow for expanded SDC production. 

ICC s
 R D team will collaborate on SDC product line development.

Debt 

Receipt
of CARES funding 

In
April 2021, we were funded 239,000 under the Payroll Protection Program PPP through California Bank and Trust. The PPP
was established as part of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (the CARES Act and is administered by
the U.S. Small Business Administration. The CARES Act was established in order to enable small businesses to pay employees during the
economic slowdown caused by COVID-19 by providing forgivable loans to qualifying businesses for up to 2.5 times their average monthly
payroll costs. The amount borrowed under the CARES Act is eligible to be forgiven provided that (a) the Company uses the PPP Funds during
the eight week period after receipt thereof, and (b) the PPP Funds are only used to cover payroll costs (including benefits), rent, mortgage
interest, and utility costs. The amount of loan forgiveness will be reduced if, among other reasons, the Company does not maintain staffing
or payroll levels. Principal and interest payments on any unforgiven portion of the PPP Funds (the PPP Loan will be deferred
for six months and will accrue interest at a fixed annual rate of 1.0 and carry a two year maturity date. There is no prepayment penalty
on the CARES Act Loan. 

We
intend to use the entire loan amount for qualifying expenses. Under the terms of the PPP, certain amounts of the loan may be forgiven
if they are used for qualifying expenses. We intend to apply for forgiveness of the PPP loan with respect to these qualifying expenses,
however, it cannot assure that such forgiveness of any portion of the PPP loan will occur. As for the potential loan forgiveness, once
the PPP loan is, in part or wholly, forgiven and a legal release is received, the liability would be reduced by the amount forgiven and
a gain on extinguishment would be recorded. The terms of the PPP loan provide for customary events of default including, among other
things, payment defaults, breach of representations and warranties, and insolvency events. We were in compliance with the terms of the
PPP loan as of July 31, 2021.

Share-Based Compensation 

Restricted
Stock Units 

The
Company issues restricted stock unit awards RSUs to key management and as compensation for services to consultants and
others. The RSUs typically vest over a one to three-year period and carry a ten-year term. Each RSU represents the right to receive one
share of common stock, issuable at the time the RSU subsequently settles, as set forth in the Restricted Stock Unit Agreement. The Company
determines that fair value of those awards at the date of grant, and amortizes those awards as an expense over the vesting period of
the award. The shares earned under the grant are usually issued when the award settles at the end of the term. 

On
October 4, 2018, the Board of Directors appointed Tom Myers as the Company s Chief Operating Officer. In connection with Mr. Myers
appointment, the Board agreed to grant him 500,000 RSUs upon the achievement by the Company of profitability for a fiscal quarter, after
which such RSUs shall vest annually over the following three years. In May 2020, the 500,000 RSUs were formally granted to Mr. Myers
due to the Company s profitable April 30, 2020 fiscal quarter. During the fiscal year ended July 31, 2021 there were no Restricted
Stock Units granted. 

During
the fiscal year ended July 31, 2020, the Company recognized 70,000 of compensation cost relating to the 400,000 shares vesting during
the period. In addition, the Company accelerated the vesting of 400,000 shares of stock issued to Henry R. Lambert with a remaining value
of 162,000 upon his retirement during the period. In total, the Company recognized 232,000 from the vesting of these restricted stock
units during the year ended July 31, 2020. During the fiscal year ended July 31, 2021, the Company recognized 83,000 of compensation
cost relating to the 166,667 shares vesting during the period 

Of
the 2,012,500 RSUs outstanding as of July 31, 2021, 1,679,167 RSUs are vested and issuable. These RSUs are issued upon settlement date
which is defined as for each Vested Unit, the earliest of (i) the ten-year anniversary of the Grant Date; (ii) sixty days after
the date the Grantee s Service ceases for any reason and such cessation constitutes a separation from service within
the meaning of Section 409A of the Code; (iii) the date of Grantee s death or (iv) the date of a Change in Control that constitutes
a change in control event within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code . 

As
of July 31, 2021, there was 144,000 of unrecognized non-cash compensation cost related to the remaining 333,333 RSUs we expect to vest,
which will be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.75 years.

The
weighted average expected term of options outstanding at July 31, 2020 was 6.13 years. 

For
the fiscal year ended July 31, 2021 share-based compensation expense for stock options vesting during the period was 758,000. For the
fiscal year ended July 31, 2020 share-based compensation expense for stock options vesting during the period was 555,000. 

At
July 31, 2021, options to purchase 6,740,375 shares of common stock were exercisable. These options had a weighted-average exercise price
of 0.83 and a weighted average remaining contractual term of 5.16 years. The weighted average grant date fair value for options granted
during the fiscal year ended July 31, 2021 was 0.33. The total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested stock option grants
as of July 31, 2021 was approximately 505,000 and the weighted average period over which these grants are expected to vest is 1.10 years. 

We
use the Black-Scholes valuation model to calculate the fair value of stock options. Share-based compensation expense is recognized over
the vesting period using the straight-line method. The fair value of stock options was estimated at the grant date using the following
weighted average assumptions:

Volatility
is the measure by which our stock price is expected to fluctuate during the expected term of an option. Volatility is derived from the
historical daily change in the market price of our common stock, as we believe that historical volatility is the best indicator of future
volatility. 

The
risk-free interest rates used in the Black-Scholes calculations are based on the prevailing U.S. Treasury yield as determined by the
U.S. Federal Reserve. 

F- 16 

We
have never paid dividends on our common stock and do not anticipate paying dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. Accordingly,
we have assumed no dividend yield for purposes of estimating the fair value of our share-based compensation. 

The
weighted average expected life of options was estimated using the average of the contractual term and the weighted average vesting term
of the options. Certain options granted to consultants are subject to variable accounting treatment and are required to be revalued until
vested.

Related Party Transactions 

On
July 29, 2019, we entered into a Sublease Agreement (the Sublease with SwabPlus L.P. SwabPlus ), effective
July 25, 2019, pursuant to which we subleased certain office and industrial space for our corporate headquarters. The premises are located
in Rancho Cucamonga, California. In December 2020, the Sublease expired. The Company is currently negotiating a new lease agreement with
SwabPlus. Rent expense, including common area maintenance and real property taxes, was 87,000 and 37,000 for the years ended July 31,
2021 and 2020, respectively. Tom Y. Lee, the Company s Chief Executive Officer, Chairman of the Board and President, also serves
as chairman of the board of directors and chief executive officer of SwabPlus. Mr. Lee also serves as president of Hermosa Property,
Inc., the landlord of the premises subject to the Sublease. The Sublease was considered by the Company in accordance with the Company s
Related Party Transaction and Procedures Policy, and approved by the disinterested members of the Board. 

During
the fiscal year ended July 31, 2020, we sold 124,000 of product to Harmony Bioscience, Inc. PURE Chairman and CEO Tom Y. Lee is an affiliate
of Harmony Bioscience. 

As
of July 31, 2021 and July 31, 2020, accounts payable include 134,000 and 60,000 in board fees due to officers and directors, respectively.

Income Taxes 

We
file federal and state consolidated tax returns with our subsidiaries. Our income tax provision for the years ended July 31, 2021 and
2020 was 1,650; the minimum state franchise taxes we pay regardless of income or loss. 

At
July 31, 2021, we had federal and state tax net operating loss carry-forwards of approximately 107.5 million and 62.3 million, respectively.
At July 31, 2020, we had federal and state tax net operating loss carry-forwards of approximately 106.2 million and 61.8 million, respectively.
Utilization of the net operating loss carry-forwards may be subject to a substantial annual limitation due to ownership change limitations
that may have occurred or that could occur in the future, as required by Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code as well as similar
state provisions. These ownership changes may limit the amount of net operating loss carry-forwards that can be utilized annually to
offset future taxable income and tax, respectively. In general, an ownership change, as defined by Section 382 of the Internal Revenue
Code results from a transaction or series of transactions over a three-year period resulting in an ownership change of more than 50 percentage
points of the outstanding stock of a company by certain stockholders or public groups. Since our formation, we have raised capital through
the issuance of capital stock on several occasions (both before and after our initial public offering in 1996) which, combined with the
purchasing stockholders subsequent disposition of those shares, may have resulted in such an ownership change, or could result
in an ownership change in the future upon subsequent disposition. While we do not believe that we have experienced an ownership change,
the pertinent tax rules related thereto are complex and subject to varying interpretations, and thus complete assurance cannot be provided
that the taxing authorities would not take an alternative position. 

Our
current federal tax loss carry-forwards began expiring in the year ended July 31, 2020 and, unless previously utilized, all but 3.7
million will completely expire in the year ending July 31, 2038. The 3.7 million can be carried forward indefinitely. Our state tax
loss carry-forwards began to expire in the year ending July 31, 2029, and will completely expire in the year ending July 31, 2040.

Following
authoritative guidance, we recognize the tax benefit from a tax position if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be
sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. 

Our
practice is to recognize interest and/or penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense; however we have had no accrued
interest or penalties at either July 31, 2021 or July 31, 2020. We are subject to income taxes in the United States and in various states,
and our historical tax years remain subject to future examination by the U.S. and state tax authorities. During the years ended July
31, 2021 and 2020, we did not record any activity related to our unrecognized tax benefits. 

The
Company and its subsidiaries are subject to federal income tax as well as income tax of multiple state jurisdictions. With few exceptions,
the Company is no longer subject to income tax examination by tax authorities in major jurisdictions for tax years prior to 2012. However,
to the extent allowed by law, the taxing authorities may have the right to examine prior periods where net operating losses were generated
and carried forward, and make adjustments up to the amount of the carryforwards. The Company is not currently under examination by the
IRS or state taxing authorities.

General 

Pure
Bioscience, Inc. we, us, and our has one class of securities registered under Section 12
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended - our common stock, 0.01 par value per share. 

The
following information describes our capital stock, as well as certain provisions of our Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws. The
summary does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to our Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws,
copies of which have been filed as exhibits to our public filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 

Our
authorized capital stock consists of 150,000,000 shares of common stock and 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock with a 0.01 par value
per share, all of which shares of preferred stock are undesignated. Our board of directors may establish the rights and preferences of
the preferred stock from time to time. As of October 28, 2021, there were 87,223,141 shares of common stock issued and outstanding, held
of record by 224 stockholders, although we believe that there may be a significantly larger number of beneficial owners of our common
stock. We derived the number of stockholders by reviewing the listing of outstanding common stock recorded by our transfer agent as of
October 27, 2021. 

Common
Stock 

The
holders of common stock are entitled to one vote per share on all matters to be voted upon by the stockholders. The holders of common
stock are entitled to receive ratably such dividends, if any, as may be declared from time to time by the board of directors out of funds
legally available, subject to preferences that may be applicable to preferred stock, if any, then outstanding. In the event of a liquidation,
dissolution or winding up of our company, the holders of common stock are entitled to share ratably in all assets remaining after payment
of liabilities, subject to prior distribution rights of preferred stock, if any, then outstanding. The common stock has no preemptive
or conversion rights or other subscription rights. There are no redemption or sinking fund provisions applicable to the common stock.
All outstanding shares of common stock are fully paid and non-assessable. 

The
rights, preferences and privileges of the holders of our common stock are subject to, and may be adversely affected by, the rights of
the holders of shares of any series of preferred stock that we may designate and issue in the future. 

Our
common stock is approved for quotation on the OTC Markets OTCQB marketplace under the symbol PURE. The transfer
agent and registrar for the common stock is Transfer Online, Inc. Its address is 512 SE Salmon St. Portland, OR 97214, and its telephone

Preferred
Stock 

Pursuant
to our Certificate of Incorporation, our Board of Directors has the authority, without further action by our stockholders (unless such
stockholder action is required by applicable law), to designate and issue up to 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock in one or more series,
to establish from time to time the number of shares to be included in each such series, to fix the designations, powers, preferences
and rights of the shares of each wholly unissued series, and any qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereon, and to increase
or decrease the number of shares of any such series, but not below the number of shares of such series then outstanding. 

Our
Board of Directors may authorize the issuance of preferred stock with voting or conversion rights that could adversely affect the voting
power or other rights of the holders of our common stock. Preferred stock could be issued quickly with terms designed to delay or prevent
a change in control of the Company or make removal of management more difficult. Additionally, the issuance of preferred stock may have
the effect of decreasing the market price of our common stock. 

Anti-takeover
effects of provisions of our Certificate of Incorporation, our Bylaws and Delaware law 

Certificate
of Incorporation and Bylaws 

Because
our stockholders do not have cumulative voting rights in the election of directors, stockholders holding a majority of the shares of
common stock represented in person or by proxy at a duly called stockholder meeting will be able to elect all of our directors. Our Board
of Directors will be able to elect a director to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of the Board or due to the resignation, death
or departure of an existing member of the Board. Our Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws also provide that all stockholder actions
must be effected at a duly called meeting of stockholders and not by a consent in writing, and that only the Board of Directors, Chairman
of the Board or Chief Executive Officer may call a special meeting of stockholders. In addition, our Bylaws include a requirement for
the advance notice of nominations for election to our Board of Directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon at a stockholders 
meeting. As described above, our Certificate of Incorporation also provides for the ability of the Board of Directors to issue, without
stockholder approval, up to 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock with terms set by the Board of Directors, which rights could be senior
to those of our common stock and which terms could be designed to delay or prevent a change in control of the Company or make removal
of management more difficult. 

The
foregoing provisions may make it difficult for our existing stockholders to replace our Board of Directors, as well as for another party
to obtain control of the Company by replacing our Board of Directors. In addition, the authorization of undesignated preferred stock
makes it possible for the Board of Directors to issue preferred stock with voting or other rights or preferences that could impede the
success of any attempt to change the Company s control. Further, our Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws provide that we will
indemnify our directors and officers against liabilities, losses and expenses incurred or suffered in investigations and legal proceedings
resulting from their services for us, which may include service in connection with takeover defense measures. 

Delaware
Anti-Takeover Statute 

We
are subject to the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the DGCL regulating corporate takeovers.
Under Section 203 of the DGCL, a Delaware corporation is prohibited from engaging in a business combination with an interested
stockholder for three years following the date that such person or entity becomes an interested stockholder. With certain exceptions,
an interested stockholder is a person or entity that owns, individually or with or through other persons or entities, fifteen percent
(15 or more of the corporation s outstanding voting stock (including rights to acquire stock pursuant to an option, warrant,
agreement, arrangement or understanding, or upon the exercise of conversion or exchange rights, and also stock as to which the person
has voting rights only). The three-year moratorium imposed by Section 203 on business combinations does not apply if: 

Prior
 to the date on which the interested stockholder becomes an interested stockholder, the board of directors of the corporation approves
 either the business combination or the transaction that resulted in the person or entity becoming an interested stockholder; 

Upon
 consummation of the transaction that makes the person or entity an interested stockholder, the interested stockholder owns at least
 eighty-five percent (85 of the corporation s voting stock outstanding at the time the transaction commenced (excluding, for
 purposes of determining voting stock outstanding, shares owned by directors who are also officers of the corporation and shares held
 by employee stock plans that do not give employee participants the right to decide confidentially whether to accept a tender or exchange
 offer); or 

On
 or after the date the person or entity becomes an interested stockholder, the business combination is approved both by the board
 of directors and by the stockholders at a meeting by sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66 2/3 of the outstanding voting stock
 not owned by the interested stockholder. 

In
general, Section 203 defines business combination to include the following: 

any
 merger or consolidation involving the corporation and the interested stockholder; 

any
 sale, lease, exchange, mortgage, transfer, pledge or other disposition of 10 or more of either the assets or outstanding stock of
 the corporation involving the interested stockholder; 

subject
 to certain exceptions, any transaction that results in the issuance or transfer by the corporation of any stock of the corporation
 to the interested stockholder; 

any
 transaction involving the corporation that has the effect of increasing the proportionate share of the stock of any class or series
 of the corporation beneficially owned by the interested stockholder; or 

the
 receipt by the interested stockholder of the benefit of any loans, advances, guarantees, pledges or other financial benefits by or
 through the corporation. 

In
general, Section 203 defines interested stockholder as an entity or person who, together with affiliates and associates, beneficially
owns, or within three years prior to the determination of interested stockholder status did own, 15 or more of the outstanding voting
stock of the corporation. 

A
Delaware corporation may opt out of these provisions with an express provision in its original certificate of incorporation
or an express provision in its certificate of incorporation or bylaws resulting from a stockholders amendment approved by at least
a majority of the outstanding voting shares. We have not opted out and do not plan to opt out of these provisions.
The statute could prohibit or delay mergers or other takeover or change in control attempts and, accordingly, may discourage attempts
to acquire us. 

The
provisions of Delaware law and our Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws could have the effect of discouraging others from attempting
hostile takeovers and, as a consequence, they may also inhibit temporary fluctuations in the market price of our common stock that often
result from actual or rumored hostile takeover attempts. These provisions may also have the effect of preventing changes in our management.
It is possible that these provisions may make it more difficult to accomplish transactions that stockholders may otherwise deem to be
in their best interests.
