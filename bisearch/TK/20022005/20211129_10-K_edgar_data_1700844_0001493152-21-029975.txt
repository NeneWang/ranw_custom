Revenues 

We
recognized no revenues for the years ended August 31, 2021 and 2020. 

Gross
Margin 

Gross
margin is calculated by subtracting cost of sales from revenue. Gross margin percentage is calculated by dividing gross margins by revenue. 

We
did not record any cost of goods sold for either of the years ended August 31, 2021, and 2020. As such, we did not realize any gross
margin for either of the years ended August 31, 2021 and 2020.

expenses totaled 61,545 for the year ended August 31, 2021, compared to 14,364 in operating expenses for the year ended August 31,
2020, or an increase of 47,181. 

Our
operating expenses are primarily comprised of professional fees or administrative
contracted services, such as legal and accounting, and other general and administrative costs.
The increase in operating expenses was due to an increase in professional services rendered in relation to our financial reporting and
other matters. 

Net
loss 

We
incurred a net loss from of 61,545, or 0.02 per share, for the year ended August 31, 2021, compared to a net loss of 14,364, or 0.00
per share, for the year ended August 31, 2020. The increase in net loss was due to the increase in above operating expenses.

Going
Concern 

The Company s financial statements as
of August 31, 2021, are prepared using generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America applicable as a going
concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the ordinary course of business. The Company
has yet to establish an ongoing source of revenue to finance its operating expenses and to continue operating as a going concern. The
Company has accumulated loss from inception (February 17, 2017) to August 31, 2021 of 92,626. These factors raised substantial doubt
about the ability of the Company to continue operating as a going concern for a reasonable period of time. 

In order to continue operating as a going concern,
the Company is committed to work on procuring financial resources and develop business plans. The Management plans to procure financial
resources from the Management and major shareholders to fund operating expenses as well as seeking third party equity and/or debt financing
to implement its business plans. However, the Management is not able to provide any assurances that the Company will successfully executing
the plans in the near term. These financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability and classification
of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going
concern. 

Plan
of Operation and Funding 

We expect that working capital
requirements will continue to be funded through further issuances of securities/ debt securities. Our working capital requirements are
expected to increase in line with the growth of our business. 

Existing working capital,
further advances and equity/ debt financing, the anticipated cash flow are expected to be adequate to finance our operations over the
next twelve months. We have no lines of credit or other bank financing arrangements. Generally, we have financed operations to date through
the proceeds of the private placement of equity and debt instruments. In connection with our business plans, the Management anticipates
additional increases in operating expenses and capital expenditures relating to: (i) developmental expenses associated with a start-up
business and (ii) marketing expenses. We intend to finance these expenses with further issuances of securities, and debt issuances. Thereafter,
we expect we will need to raise additional capital and generate revenues to meet long-term operating requirements. Additional issuances
of equity or convertible debt securities will result in dilution to our current shareholders. Further, such securities might have rights,
preferences or privileges senior to our common stock. Additional financing may not be available upon acceptable terms, or at all. If
adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms, we may not be able to take advantage of prospective new business
endeavors or opportunities, which could significantly and materially restrict our business operations. 

Material
Commitments 

As
of the date of this Annual Report, we do not have any material commitments. 

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements 

As
of the date of this Annual Report, we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current
or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity,
capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors. 

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements 

Management
has considered all recent accounting pronouncements issued. Our Company s management believes that these recent pronouncements
will not have a material effect on our financial statements.

REPORT
OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

To
the Board of Directors and Stockholders of UNEX HOLDINGS INC.: 

Opinion
on the Financial Statements 

We
have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Unex Holdings Inc. the Company as of August 31, 2021 and August 31, 2020,
and the related statements of operations, stockholders equity, and cash flows for the years then ended, and
the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements ). In our opinion, the financial statements present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial positions of the Company as of August 31, 2021 and August 31, 2020, and the results of
its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States. 

Going
concern uncertainty 

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note
2 to the financial statements, the Company has not yet established an ongoing source of revenue sufficient to cover its operating expenses
and allow it to continue as a going concern. The Company has accumulated loss since inception which raise substantial doubt about its
ability to continue as a going concern. Management s plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 2. The financial
statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

Basis
for Opinion 

These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s
financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal
securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company
is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audit
we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion
on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our
audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or
fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audit provides
a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

Emphasis
of Matter 

The
Company has significant transactions with related parties, which are described in Note 6 to the financial statements. Transactions involving
related parties cannot be presumed to be carried out on an arm s length basis, as the requisite conditions of competitive, free
market dealings may not exist.

TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

Note
1 organization and business operations 

UNEX
HOLDINGS INC. (the Company is a corporation established under the corporation laws in the State of Nevada on February
17, 2017. The Company has adopted an August 31 fiscal year end. 

The
Company is a development stage company and intends to provide geodesy services. 

NOTE
2 GOING CONCERN 

The Company s financial statements as of
August 31, 2021, are prepared using generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America applicable as a going concern,
which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the ordinary course of business. The Company has yet to
establish an ongoing source of revenue to finance its operating expenses and to continue operating as a going concern. The Company has
accumulated loss from inception (February 17, 2017) to August 31, 2021 of 92,626. These factors raised substantial doubt about the ability
of the Company to continue operating as a going concern for a reasonable period of time. 

In order to continue operating as a going concern,
the Company is committed to work on procuring financial resources and develop business plans. The Management plans to procure financial
resources from the Management and major shareholders to fund operating expenses as well as seeking third party equity and/or debt financing
to implement its business plans. However, the Management is not able to provide any assurances that the Company will successfully executing
the plans in the near term. These financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability and classification
of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going
concern. 

NOTE
3 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 

Basis
of Presentation 

The
accompanying audited financial statements as of August 31, 2021 and August 31, 2020 have been prepared in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America GAAP ). In the opinion of management, such financial information
includes all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring adjustments) considered necessary for a fair presentation of the Company s
financial position at such date and the operating results and cash flows for such periods. Operating results for the twelve months ended
August 31, 2021 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for any subsequent interim period or for the next
entire year. 

The
Company has adopted an August 31 fiscal year-end. 

Use
of Estimates 

The
preparation of the audited financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, expenses and disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements.
The Company bases its estimates and assumptions on historical experience, known or expected trends and various other assumptions that
it believes to be reasonable. As future events and their effects cannot be determined with precision, actual results could differ from
the estimates that may cause the Company s future results to be affected. 

Cash
and Cash Equivalents 

The
Company considers all highly liquid short-term instruments that are purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be
cash equivalents. The Company did not have any cash equivalents as of August 31, 2021. 

F- 7 

Property
and Equipment 

Property
and equipment are stated at cost and depreciated on the straight-line method over the estimated life of the asset, which is 3 years. 

Stock
Subscriptions Receivable 

Stock
subscriptions are recorded as contra-equity on the day the subscription agreement is signed and accepted by the Company. All stock subscribed
as of the date of these financial statements has been fully paid. 

Net
Loss per Common Share 

Net
loss per common share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average common shares outstanding during the period as defined
by Financial Accounting Standards, ASC Topic 260, Earnings per Share. Basic earnings per common share EPS calculations are determined by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the year.
Diluted earnings per common share calculations are determined by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares
and dilutive common share equivalents outstanding. 

Income
Taxes 

The
Company accounts for income taxes pursuant to the provisions of ASC 740-10, Accounting for Income Taxes, which requires,
among other things, an asset and liability approach to calculating deferred income taxes. The asset and liability approach require the
recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying
amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 

A
valuation allowance is provided to offset any net deferred tax assets for which management believes it is more likely than not that the
net deferred asset will not be realized. 

The
Company follows the provisions of the ASC 740 -10 related to, Accounting for Uncertain Income Tax Positions. When tax returns are filed,
it is highly certain that some positions taken would be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities, while others are subject
to uncertainty about the merits of the position taken or the amount of the position that would be ultimately sustained. In accordance
with the guidance of ASC 740-10, the benefit of a tax position is recognized in the financial statements in the period during which,
based on all available evidence, management believes it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination,
including the resolution of appeals or litigation processes, if any. Tax positions taken are not offset or aggregated with other positions.
Tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold are measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is more
than 50 percent likely of being realized upon settlement with the applicable taxing authority. The portion of the benefits associated
with tax positions taken that exceeds the amount measured as described above should be reflected as a liability for uncertain tax benefits
in the accompanying balance sheet along with any associated interest and penalties that would be payable to the taxing authorities upon
examination. The Company believes its tax positions will be highly certain of being upheld upon examination. As such, the Company has
not recorded a liability for uncertain tax benefits. 

The
Company has adopted ASC 740-10-25 Definition of Settlement, which provides guidance on how an entity should determine whether a tax position
is effectively settled for the purpose of recognizing previously unrecognized tax benefits and provides that a tax position can be effectively
settled upon the completion of an examination by a taxing authority without being legally extinguished. For tax positions considered
effectively settled, an entity would recognize the full amount of tax benefit, even if the tax position is not considered more likely
than not to be sustained based solely on the basis of its technical merits and the statute of limitations remains open. 

Fair
Value Measurements 

The
Company adopted the provisions of ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures , which defines fair value as used
in numerous accounting pronouncements, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure of fair value measurements. 

The
estimated fair value of certain financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents are carried at historical cost basis, which
approximates their fair values because of the short-term nature of these instruments. 

F- 8 

ASC
820 defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the
principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement
date. ASC 820 also establishes a fair value hierarchy, which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize
the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. ASC 820 describes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value: 

Level
1 quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 

Level
2 quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or inputs that are observable 

Level
3 inputs that are unobservable (for example cash flow modeling inputs based on assumptions) 

The
Company has no assets or liabilities valued at fair value on a recurring basis. 

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements 

Except
for rules and interpretive releases of the SEC under the authority of federal securities laws and a limited number of grandfathered standards,
the FASB Accounting Standards Codification ASC is the sole source of authoritative GAAP literature recognized
by the FASB and applicable to the Company. Management has reviewed the aforementioned rules and releases and believes any effect will
not have a material impact on the Company s present or future financial statements. 

In
December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740), which enhances and simplifies various aspects of the income tax
accounting guidance, including requirements such as tax basis step-up in goodwill obtained in a transaction that is not a business combination,
ownership changes in investments, and interim-period accounting for enacted changes in tax law. The amendment will be effective for public
companies with fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020; early adoption is permitted. The Company is evaluating the impact of this
amendment on its financial statements. 

In
February 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-02, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326) and Leases (Topic 842) - Amendments to SEC
Paragraphs Pursuant to SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 119 and Update to SEC Section on Effective Date Related to Accounting Standards
Update No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), which amends the effective date of the original pronouncement for smaller reporting companies.
ASU 2016-13 and its amendments will be effective for the Company for interim and annual periods in fiscal years beginning after December
15, 2022. The Company believes the adoption will modify the way the Company analyzes financial instruments, but it does not anticipate
a material impact on results of operations. The Company is in the process of determining the effects adoption will have on its financial
statements.

written commitment for continued support by officers, directors, or shareholders. Amounts represent advances or amounts paid in satisfaction
of liabilities. The advances are considered temporary in nature and have not been formalized by a promissory note.

pay for incorporation costs and operating expenses. The loan is unsecured, non-interest bearing and repayable on demand.

to pay audit and professional fees on behalf of the Company. The obligations bear no interest, have no fixed term and are not evidenced
by any written agreement. As of August 31, 2021, the balance in due to related party is 44,134. 

NOTE
7 CHANGE OF CONTROL 

Pursuant
to the terms of the Securities Purchase Agreement dated February 26, 2021, by and among Veniamin Minkov, the former sole officer, director,
and majority stockholder of the Company and Low Wai Koon (the Agreement ), effective February 26, 2021 (the Effective
Time ), Veniamin Minkov, the then sole executive officer and director of the Company and the owner of 2,000,000 restricted shares
of the Company s common stock representing 67.34 of the Company s issued and outstanding common stock Unex Shares ),
sold the Unex Shares to Low Wai Koon for an aggregate consideration of 340,000, or approximately 0.17 per share. In addition, certain
stockholders purchased 966,000 shares of the Company s common stock in a series of private transactions for 0.05176 a share from
non-affiliates of the Company (the Non-Affiliate Shares ). Upon completion of the purchase of the Unex Shares, Low Wai Koon
owned 2,000,000 shares, or approximately 67.34 of the issued and outstanding common stock of the Company, which resulted in a change
of control of the Company. Upon completion of the Non-Affiliate Shares, certain stockholders owned 966,000 shares or approximately 32.53 
of the issued and outstanding common stock of the Company. 

In
connection with the Agreement, on February 26, 2021, Veniamin Minkov resigned as the President, Treasurer, and Secretary of the Company
and Chairman of the Board of the Company. Mr. Minkov s resignation as President, Treasurer, and Secretary of the Company
and Chairman of the Board was effective immediately. Mr. Minkov s resignation as a director became effective on March 4, 2021.

Officer, Chief Financial Officer, President, Secretary and Treasurer, of the Company. 

In
accordance with the terms of the Agreement, Veniamin Minkov warranted that on the Effective Date the Company will have no assets and
no debt of any kind including no outstanding tax liabilities and that all existing contracts entered into by the Company shall be cancelled
without liability. 

NOTE
8. INCOME TAXES 

The
Company has no tax provision for any period presented due to our history of operating losses. 

In
the event an ownership change, Section 382 imposes an annual limitation on the amount of taxable income we may offset with U.S. NOLs.
This annual limitation is generally equal to the product of the value of our shares on the date of the ownership change multiplied by
the long-term tax-exempt rate in effect on the date of the ownership change. The long-term tax-exempt rate is published monthly by the
Internal Revenue Service. Any unused Section 382 annual limitation may be carried over to later years until the applicable expiration
date for the respective U.S. NOLs. 

F- 10 

As
of August 31, 2021, the Company had estimated net operating loss carryforwards of approximately 0.1 million. The ownership change (refer
to Note 7), as defined under Section 382, our ability to utilize our U.S. NOLs would become substantially limited. Future tax benefits
which may arise as a result of these losses have not been recognized in these financial statements, as management has determined that
their realization is not likely to occur and accordingly, the Company has recorded a valuation allowance for the full value of the deferred
tax asset relating to these tax losses carry forwards. Additionally, the Company has not filed tax returns; accordingly the potential
realizability of this loss in future periods is indeterminable. 

NOTE
9. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS 

In
accordance with FASB ASC 855-10 Subsequent Events, the Company has analyzed its operations subsequent to August 31, 2021 to the date
these financial statements were issued, and has determined that it does not have any material subsequent events to disclose in these
consolidated financial statements.

ITEM
9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining a system of disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e)
and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) that is designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that
we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Commission s
rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information
required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated
to the issuer s management, including its principal executive officer or officers and principal financial officer or officers,
or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

An
evaluation was conducted under the supervision and with the participation of our management of the effectiveness of the design and operation
of our disclosure controls and procedures as of August 31, 2021. Based on our management s evaluation under the framework in Internal
Control-Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, our management concluded
that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of such date to ensure that information required to be disclosed in
the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified
in SEC rules and forms. 

A
material weakness is a control deficiency, or combination of control deficiencies, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a
material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. We have identified
a lack of segregation of duties, a lack of audit committee or independent governance/oversight, and timely communication with vendors
to obtain invoices and record expenses and liabilities as material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting as of
the end of the fiscal year ended August 31, 2021. 

Such
officer also confirmed that there was no change in our internal control over financial reporting during the year August 31, 2021 that
has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
