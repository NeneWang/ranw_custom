Our Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm s
report contains a statement that our net loss and limited working capital raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going
concern. Our independent registered public accountants have stated in their report (included in Item 8. Financial Statements) that our
significant operating losses and working capital deficit raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. We
incurred net income of 1,221 for the year ended June 30, 2021 and net loss of 2,477,557 during the year ended June 30, 2020. Although
the Company continues to rely on equity and debt investors to finance its losses, it is implementing plans to achieve cost savings and
other strategic objectives to address Company profitability. In addition to raising debt and equity financing, the Company continues to
focus on growing the subsidiaries anticipated to be most profitable while reducing investments in areas that are not expected to have
long-term benefits. The Company will continue to pursue synergistic opportunities to enhance its business portfolio.

3,406,684 
 1,178,154 

The acquisition of Prakat occurred in January
2020, and revenue was generated from the date of acquisition until June 30, 2020, whereas for fiscal 2021, revenue was recorded for an
entire fiscal year. Dalrada Health s sales activity picked up in 2020 when the Company acquired Shark Technologies and launched
its GlanHealth product line. The acquisition of Shark Technologies occurred in March of 2020, and revenue was generated from the date
of acquisition until June 30, 2020, whereas for fiscal 2021, revenue was recorded for an entire fiscal year. Likido s revenue increased
during 2021 as it was primarily an R D entity during fiscal 2020. 

Operating Expenses 

Operating expenses for the year ended June 30,
2021 was 9,504,869 compared to operating expenses of 3,241,335 during the year ended June 30, 2020, an increase of 6,263,534. The increase
in operating expenses was due to an increase in the operating activity as most of fiscal 2020 was spent on the continuing development
of the Company s proposed business operations. The increase was also partially attributable to non-cash stock compensation, the
continued development and commercialization of the Likido operation and new business units. 

7 

Other Income (Expense) 

During the years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020,
the Company recognized 670,272 and 768,361, respectively, of penalties and interest within interest expense on the consolidated statements
of operations. For years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, the Company recognized 9,504,041 and 1,229,199, respectively, within Gain
on expiration of accrued payroll taxes as a result of quarterly tax liabilities that expired during the fiscal years. 

Net Income (Loss) 

Net income for the year ended June 30, 2021 was
 1,221 compared to a net loss of 2,477,557 during the year ended June 30, 2020. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

As of June 30, 2021, the Company had current
assets of 1,640,511 and current liabilities of 17,264,374 compared with current assets of 1,251,537 and current liabilities of 17,029,243
at June 30, 2020. The decrease in the working capital deficit was due to the fact that the Company recovered tax liability during the
year which was used to offset outstanding obligations. Cash presently on hand is immaterial. The continuation of the Company as a going
concern is dependent upon the successful financing through equity and/or debt investors and growing the subsidiaries anticipated to be
profitable while reducing investments in areas that are not expected to have long-term benefits. The Company anticipates an increase
in sales through the commercialization of the Likido heating and cooling units, the expansion of Prakat s technology services,
IHG s increased educational footprint, additional GlanHealth sales channels and other new business opportunities (see Subsequent
Events ). These consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to the recoverability and classification of recorded

Critical Accounting Policies 

Our financial statements and accompanying notes
have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles applied on a consistent basis. The preparation
of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. 

We regularly evaluate the accounting policies
and estimates that we use to prepare our financial statements. A complete summary of these policies is included in note (1) of the notes
to our financial statements. In general, management's estimates are based on historical experience, on information from third party professionals,
and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the facts and circumstances. Actual results could differ from
those estimates made by management. 

Accrued Payroll Taxes 

The total balance for Federal Accrued Payroll
Taxes is accumulated on a quarterly basis beginning on their respective quarterly filing dates. Accrued Interest is compounded daily at
an Effective Annual Interest Rate of approximately seven percent. The individual quarterly sub-totals have a calculated expiration date
of Ten years according to the Internal Revenue Service statute of limitations. This timeline can be extended as a result of bankruptcy
or other legal action that is filed by the company (Code 520 per IRS Federal Account Transcripts). Code 520 effectively stops the clock
for the Statute of limitations until the Bankruptcy or other legal action has been removed (Code 521 per IRS Federal Account Transcripts).
In addition to the number of days between Code 520 and 521, every Code 520 automatically extends the IRS Statute of limitations by 30
days. As the quarterly sub-totals surpass their respective Calculated Expiration Date the company removes the liability
from the Consolidated Balance Sheets and an equivalent amount is recognized as Gain on expiration of accrued payroll taxes 
on the Statements of Operations. The amount owing may be subject to additional late filing fees and penalties that are not quantifiable
as at the date of these consolidated financial statements. 

Revenue Recognition 

The Company recognizes and accounts for revenue
in accordance with ASC 606 as a principal on the sale of goods. Pursuant to ASC 606, revenue is measured based on a consideration specified
in a contract with a customer, and excludes any sales incentives and amounts collected on behalf of third parties. The Company recognizes
revenue when it satisfies a performance obligation by transferring control over a product or service to a customer. 

Use of Estimates 

The preparation of financial statements in conformity
with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and
the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. These estimates and assumptions take into account historical
and forward-looking factors that the Company believes are reasonable, including but not limited to the potential impacts arising from
the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) and related public and private sector policies and initiatives. Actual results could differ from those
estimates and assumptions. A couple key categories that use estimates are Goodwill, Intangible Assets, and Impairment. 

Stock-Based Compensation 

The Company records stock-based compensation in
accordance with ASC 718, Compensation Stock Compensation , using the fair value method. All transactions in which goods
or services are the consideration received for the issuance of equity instruments are accounted for based on the fair value of the consideration
received or the fair value of the equity instrument issued, whichever is more reliably measurable. Equity instruments issued to employees
and the cost of the services received as consideration are measured and recognized based on the fair value using quoted market prices
of the equity instruments issued. 

10 

Business
Combination 

ASC 805,
Business Combinations ASC 805 ), applies the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations to all acquisitions
where the acquirer gains a controlling interest, regardless of whether consideration was exchanged. ASC 805 establishes principles and
requirements for how the acquirer: a) recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities
assumed, and any non-controlling interest in the acquiree; b) recognizes and measures the goodwill acquired in the business combination
or a gain from a bargain purchase; and c) determines what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate
the nature and financial effects of the business combination. Accounting for acquisitions requires the Company to recognize,
separately from goodwill, the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at their acquisition-date fair values. Goodwill as of the acquisition
date is measured as the excess of consideration transferred and the net of the acquisition-date fair values of the assets acquired and
the liabilities assumed. While the Company uses its best estimates and assumptions to accurately value assets acquired and liabilities
assumed at the acquisition date, the estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. As a result, during the measurement
period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, the Company may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities
assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the values
of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to the consolidated statements
of comprehensive loss. 

Goodwill and Intangible Assets 

The Company accounts for goodwill and intangible
assets in accordance with ASC 350, Intangibles Goodwill and Other ASC 350 ). ASC 350 requires that goodwill and
other intangibles with indefinite lives should be tested for impairment annually or on an interim basis if events or circumstances indicate
that the fair value of an asset has decreased below its carrying value. 

Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting
unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating segment) on an annual basis (June 30 for the Company) and between annual
tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying
value. The Company considers its market capitalization and the carrying value of its assets and liabilities, including goodwill, when
performing its goodwill impairment test. When conducting its annual goodwill impairment assessment, the Company initially performs a qualitative
evaluation of whether it is more likely than not that goodwill is impaired. If it is determined by a qualitative evaluation that it is
more likely than not that goodwill is impaired, the Company then applies a two-step impairment test. The two-step impairment test first
compares the fair value of the Company's reporting unit to its carrying or book value. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds
its carrying value, goodwill is not impaired and the Company is not required to perform further testing. If the carrying value of the
reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the Company determines the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill and if the carrying
value of the reporting unit's goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, then an impairment loss equal to the difference is recorded in
the consolidated statements of operations. There was no impairment of goodwill as of June 30, 2021. 

An intangible asset is an identifiable non-monetary
asset without physical substance. Such an asset is identifiable when it is separable, or when it arises from contractual or other legal
rights. Separable assets can be sold, transferred, licensed, etc. Examples of intangible assets include computer software, licenses, trademarks,
patents, films and copyrights. The Company s intangible assets are finite lived assets and are amortized on a straight-line basis
over the estimated useful lives of the assets. 

Purchase Price Allocation 

Upon the completion of a business combination,
the consideration transferred as well as the assets and liabilities acquired must be recorded at their acquisition date fair values. Upon
identification of the acquirer and determination of the acquisition date, business combinations are accounted for through the preparation
of a Purchase Price Allocation (PPA). We take into consideration the five steps when completing a PPA: 

 Step 1: Determine the fair value of consideration paid; 

 Step 2: Revalue all existing assets and liabilities (excluding intangible assets and goodwill which are addressed in step 3 to 5 below)
to their acquisition date fair values; 

 Step 3: Identify the intangible assets acquired; 

 Step 4: Determine the fair value of identifiable intangible assets acquired; and, 

 Step 5: Allocate the remaining consideration to goodwill and assess the reasonableness of the overall

Related Party Transactions 

Related party transactions are conducted with
parties with which DFCO has a close association, such as majority owned subsidiaries, its executive, managers, and their families. The
types of transactions that can be conducted between related parties are many, such as sales, asset transfers, leases, lending arrangements,
guarantees, allocations of common costs, and the filing of consolidated tax returns. DFCO discloses any transaction that would impact
the decision making of the users of a company s financial statements. This involves the following disclosures: 

General. DFCO discloses all material related party transactions, including the nature of the relationship, the nature of
 the transactions, the dollar amounts of the transactions, the amounts due to or from related parties. 

Receivables. DFCO separately discloses any receivables from officers, employees, or affiliated entities. 

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements 

In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-12, Income
Taxes (Topic 740), Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes . The amendments in this Update simplify the accounting for income taxes
by removing certain exceptions to the general principles in Topic 740. The amendments also improve consistent application of and simplify
GAAP for other areas of Topic 740 by clarifying and amending existing guidance. For public business entities, the amendments in this Update
are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2020. For all other entities,
the amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2022. The Company adopted this pronouncement on July 1, 2020, and there was not a material impact on the financial statements. 

In August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06, Accounting
for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity s Own Equity , as part of its overall simplification initiative to reduce
costs and complexity of applying accounting standards while maintaining or improving the usefulness of the information provided to users
of financial statements. Among other changes, the new guidance removes from GAAP separation models for convertible debt that require the
convertible debt to be separated into a debt and equity component, unless the conversion feature is required to be bifurcated and accounted
for as a derivative or the debt is issued at a substantial premium. As a result, after adopting the guidance, entities will no longer
separately present such embedded conversion features in equity, and will instead account for the convertible debt wholly as debt. The
new guidance also requires use of the if-converted method when calculating the dilutive impact of convertible debt on earnings
per share, which is consistent with the Company s current accounting treatment under the current guidance. The guidance is effective
for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, and interim periods within those fiscal years, with
early adoption permitted, but only at the beginning of the fiscal year. The Company is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of
ASU 2020-06 will have on its consolidated financial position, results of operations and disclosures. 

We have reviewed all the recently issued, but
not yet effective, accounting pronouncements and we do not believe any of these pronouncements will have a material impact on the Company.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING
FIRM 

To the Board of Directors and 
Stockholders of Dalrada Financial Corporation 

Opinion on the Financial Statements 

 We have audited the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets of Dalrada Financial Corporation and subsidiaries (collectively the Company as of June 30, 2021 and 2020,
the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders deficit and cash flows, for the years then ended, and the related
notes (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements ). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements
present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of the Company as of June 30, 2021 and 2020, and the results
of their operations and their cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America. 

Basis for Opinion 

 These consolidated financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s consolidated financial
statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United
States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities
laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We conducted our audits in accordance with the
standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated
financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we
engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding
of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s
internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our audits included performing procedures to assess
the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures
that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the
consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide
a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

Going Concern 

 The accompanying consolidated financial statements
have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements,
the Company has had recurring losses, used cash flows from operating activities and has a significant working capital deficit, which raises
substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management s plans in regard to these matters are also described
in Note 1. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

Critical Audit Matters 

 The critical audit matter communicated below is
a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the
audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially
challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on
the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing separate opinions
on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. 

14 

Related Party Transactions including Revenue
Recognition 

 Description of the Matter: 

 As discussed in Notes 2, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12 and
14 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has significant related party transactions involving revenue, accounts receivable,
accounts payable, loans payable, advances, and expenses paid by and to multiple related parties. Our auditing of management s identification
of related parties and the related transactions including recognition of revenue was complex and is based on a thorough understanding
the Company s related party relationships, contracts, and business activities. These were the principal considerations that led
us to determine this as a critical audit matter. 

How We Addressed the Matter in our Audit: 

 We evaluated the controls over the Company s
identification of, and recording of related party transactions, and of the revenue recognition process, including walkthroughs. We confirmed
certain balances and transactions with related parties. To evaluate the related party s satisfaction of performance obligations,
our audit procedures included, among others, reviewing contracts and evaluating management s assumptions used to determine the distinct
performance obligations, and reviewing the branding work performed by the Company for various products. In addition, to identify undisclosed
related party transactions we performed the following: 1) made inquiries of management and other individuals throughout the Company; 2)
obtained a selection of expenses and reviewed for related party indicators; 3) reviewed public filings and other online information available;
4) confirmed with the transfer agent regarding significant shareholders; and 5) related procedures performed in other parts of the audit
engagement. 

Revenue Recognition 

 Description of the Matter: 

 As disclosed in Note 2, 8 and 11, the Company
recognizes revenue when or as the Company satisfies a customer agreement performance obligation by transferring control of a product or
service to a customer, in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for those products or services.
In determining revenue recognition for certain customer agreements, significant judgment was exercised by the Company, and included the
following: 1) An assessment of the products and services promised in contracts or customer agreements, and the identification of a performance
obligation for each promise to transfer to the customer a product or service that is distinct. 2) Determination of relative standalone
selling price for distinct performance obligations. 3) The timing of product or service delivery for performance obligations. Given these
factors, the related audit effort in evaluating management s judgments in determining revenue recognition for these customer agreements
was extensive, which led us to determine this as a critical audit matter 

How We Addressed the Matter in our Audit: 

 Our principal audit procedures related to the
Company s revenue recognition for these customer agreements included an evaluation of the controls related to the identification
of distinct performance obligations and the determination of the timing of revenue recognition. We also evaluated management s significant
accounting policies related to certain customer agreements. In addition, we selected customer agreements and performed the following procedures:
1) Obtained and read the customer agreements or contracts for each selected agreement. 2) Evaluated and tested management s identification
of significant terms for completeness, including the identification of distinct performance obligations. 3) Evaluated the appropriateness
of management s application of their accounting principles, in their determination of revenue recognition conclusions. 4) Tested
he mathematical accuracy of management s calculations of revenue and the associated timing of revenue recognized in the consolidated
financial statements.

DALRADA FINANCIAL CORPORATION 

 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 

 Years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020 

1. 
 Organization and Nature of Operations 

Dalrada Financial Corporation, Dalrada ),
was incorporated in September 1982 under the laws of the State of California and reincorporated in May 1983 under the laws of the State
of Delaware and reincorporated on May 5, 2020 under the laws of the state of Wyoming. 

In June 2018, the Company created a

On January 9, 2020, Dalrada purchased
seventy two percent (72 of the issued and outstanding common equity shares of Prakat Solutions Inc. a Texas corporation, Prakat ).
The purchase was made by means of a Stock Purchase Agreement SPA ). The consideration for the share purchase was three million
six hundred thousand, (3,600,000) common equity shares of DFCO. Prakat has a wholly owned subsidiary based in India, Prakat Solutions
Private Limited, which provides global customers with software and technology solutions specializing in Test Engineering, Accessibility
Engineering, Product Engineering and Application Modernization. The Prakat India team provides end to end Product Engineering services
across various domains, including Banking Financial Services, Telecom, Retail, Healthcare, Manufacturing, Legal and IT Infrastructure.
Prakat India is an ISO 9001 Certified Company. The Company is still determining the impact of this transaction on the financial statements
including the purchase price and the allocation of such (see Note 3). 

On or about March 23, 2020 Dalrada Health
Products Corporation acquired One Hundred percent (100 of the ownership of Shark. Shark is a cleaning solutions provider using electrostatic
machines to spray and deodorize residential spaces, healthcare facilities, hospitality, transportation, manufacturing, automotive, schools/education
systems, and other facilities requiring cleaning services. Through the acquisition of Shark, Dalrada Health Products developed the GlanHealth

for the end consumer. GlanHealth leverages an extensive supply chain of producers, resellers, distributors, vendors, and formulators for
the development, sale, and marketing of its products and services. 

20 

On January 29, 2021, Dalrada Health
entered into a stock purchase agreement and acquired one hundred percent (100 of the issued and outstanding shares of International
Health Group, Inc., a California corporation IHG ). The purchase price consideration is 1,000,000 common shares of DFCO,
with no shares to be released upon closing and 1,000,000 shares released quarterly over the course of twenty-four months beginning on
April 1, 2021. IHG provides highly trained nursing and medical assistants for hospitals and home health facilities since 2006. IHG Medical
Assistant programs include CNA Certified Nursing Assistant and HHA Home Health Aide training and the fast-track
22-Day CNA Certification Program at its state-approved testing facility. 

On February 3, 2021, Dalrada Health
entered into a unit purchase agreement and acquired one hundred percent (100 of the issued and outstanding membership units of Pacific
Stem Cells, LLC, a California limited liability company Pacific Stem ). The purchase price consideration is approximately
 352,000 in cash and 1,000,000 common shares of DFCO, with 300,000 shares to be released upon closing and the remaining 700,000 shares
released quarterly over the course of twenty-four months. Pacific Stem provides regenerative therapy as a potential solution for the prevention,
detection, and treatment of cellular breakdown associated with aging and a variety of other conditions. 

On April 21, 2021, the Company closed
the transaction by moving into a Membership Interest Purchase Agreement to acquire Ignite IT LLC Ignite ). The Company acquired
all of the issued and outstanding membership interests, including business plans and access to contacts of Ignite. In consideration for
the acquisition, the Company issued a promissory note for 20,000.

Genomics Empower to enter the genetic testing industry. Empower facilitates the manufacturing, filing, labeling, testing
and reporting of genetics. 

The Company's principal executive offices
are located at 600 La Terraza Blvd., Escondido, California 92025. 

Going Concern 

These consolidated financial
statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which implies that the Company will continue to realize its assets and
discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business. As at June 30, 2021, the Company had a working capital deficit of
 15,623,863 and an accumulated deficit of 107,338,174. The continuation of the Company as a going concern is dependent upon the
successful financing through equity and/or debt investors and growing the subsidiaries anticipated to be profitable while reducing
investments in areas that are not expected to have long-term benefits. The Company anticipates an increase in sales through the
commercialization of the Likido heating and cooling units, the expansion of Prakat s technology services, IHG s
increased educational footprint, additional GlanHealth sales channels and other new business opportunities (see Subsequent
Events ). These consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to the recoverability and classification of
recorded asset amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going
concern. 

2. 
 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 

(a) 
 Basis of Presentation 

These consolidated financial statements
of the Company have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States US GAAP and are expressed in U.S. dollars. The Company s fiscal year end is June 30. 

(b) 
 Principles of Consolidation 

These consolidated financial statements
include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries: Dalrada Precision, a company incorporated in the State of California,
since June 25, 2018 (date of incorporation), Dalrada Health, a company incorporated in the State of California, since October 2, 2018
(date of incorporation), as well as its subsidiaries (Likido, Prakat, Shark, IHG, Pacific Stem, Ignite, Empower) since their respective
acquisition dates (see Note 3). All inter-company transactions and balances have been eliminated on consolidation. 

21 

(c) 
 Use of Estimates 

The preparation of these condensed
consolidated financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed consolidated financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The Company regularly evaluates estimates and
assumptions related to the valuation of inventory, valuation of accrued payroll tax liabilities, valuation of acquired assets and liabilities,
variables used in the computation of share-based compensation, and evaluation of goodwill and intangible assets for impairment. 

The Company bases its estimates and
assumptions on current facts, historical experience and various other factors that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances,
the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the accrual of costs
and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. The actual results experienced by the Company may differ materially and
adversely from the Company s estimates. To the extent there are material differences between the estimates and the actual results,
future results of operations will be affected. 

(d) 
 Cash and Cash Equivalents 

The Company considers all highly liquid
instruments with a maturity of three months or less at the time of issuance to be cash equivalents. 

(e) 
 
 Concentrations of Credit Risk 

Financial instruments that potentially
subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents. The Company generally maintains
balances in various operating accounts at financial institutions that management believes to be of high credit quality, in amounts that
may exceed federally insured limits. The Company has not experienced any losses related to its cash and cash equivalents and does not
believe that it is subject to unusual credit risk beyond the normal credit risk associated with commercial banking relationships. 

During the year ended June 30, 2021,
there were no customers whose revenues accounted for 10 or greater of total revenues. During the year ended June 30, 2020, two customers
accounted for approximately 16 and 11 of total revenues, respectively. 

(f) 
 Fair Value Measurements 

Pursuant to ASC 820, Fair Value
Measurements and Disclosures , an entity is required to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable
inputs when measuring fair value. ASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy based on the level of independent, objective evidence surrounding
the inputs used to measure fair value. A financial instrument s categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the
lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. ASC 820 prioritizes the inputs into three levels that may be
used to measure fair value: 

Level 1 - applies to assets or liabilities
for which there are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. 

Level 2 - applies to assets or liabilities
for which there are inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability such as quoted prices for similar assets
or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets with insufficient volume or infrequent
transactions (less active markets); or model-derived valuations in which significant inputs are observable or can be derived principally
from, or corroborated by, observable market data. 

Level 3 - applies to assets or liabilities
for which there are unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of the fair value of the
assets or liabilities. 

The Company s financial instruments
consist principally of cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, notes payable, and amounts due to related
parties. Pursuant to ASC 820, the fair value of cash is determined based on Level 1 inputs, which consist of quoted prices
in active markets for identical assets. The recorded values of all other financial instruments approximate their current fair values because
of their nature and respective maturity dates or durations. 

22 

(g) 
 Accounts Receivable 

Accounts receivable are derived from
products and services delivered to customers and are stated at their net realizable value. Each month, the Company reviews its receivables
on a customer-by-customer basis and evaluates whether an allowance for doubtful accounts is necessary based on any known or perceived
collection issues. Any balances that are eventually deemed uncollectible are written off against the allowance after all means of collection
have been exhausted and the potential for recovery is considered remote. As of June 30, 2021 and 2020, the Company had an allowance of
doubtful accounts of 37,465 and 0, respectively. 

(h) 
 Inventory 

Inventory is recorded at the lower
of cost or net realizable value on a first-in first-out basis. As of June 30, 2021 and 2020, inventory is comprised of raw materials purchased
from suppliers, work-in-progress, and finished goods produced or purchased for resale. The Company establishes inventory reserves for
estimated obsolete or unsaleable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated realizable value based
upon assumptions about future market conditions. 

(i) 
 Property and Equipment 

Property and equipment are stated at
cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense is recognized using the straight-line method
over the estimated useful life of each asset, as follows: 

Estimated Useful Life 
 
 Computer and office equipment 
 
 3 - 5 years 
 
 Machinery and equipment 
 
 5 years 
 
 Leasehold improvements 
 
 Shorter of lease term or useful life 

Estimated useful lives are periodically
assessed to determine if changes are appropriate. Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. When assets are retired
or otherwise disposed of, the cost of these assets and related accumulated depreciation or amortization are eliminated from the balance
sheet and any resulting gains or losses are included in the statement of operations loss in the period of disposal. 

(j) 
 Business Combinations and Acquisitions 

The Company accounts for acquisitions
in which it obtains control of one or more businesses as a business combination. The purchase price of the acquired businesses is allocated
to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the acquisition date. The
excess of the purchase price over those fair values is recognized as goodwill. During the measurement period, which may be up to one year
from the acquisition date, the Company may record adjustments, in the period in which they are determined, to the assets acquired and
liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. If the assets acquired are not a business, the Company accounts for the
transaction or other event as an asset acquisition. Under both methods, the Company recognizes the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities
assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquired entity. In addition, for transactions that are business combinations, the Company
evaluates the existence of goodwill or a gain from a bargain purchase. 

23 

(k) 
 Impairment of Long-Lived Assets 

The
Company reviews its long-lived assets (property and equipment and amortizable intangible assets) for impairment whenever events or circumstances
indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If the sum of the expected cash flows, undiscounted, is less than
the carrying amount of the asset, an impairment loss is recognized as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its
fair value. 

Goodwill is tested annually at June
30 for impairment and upon the occurrence of certain events or substantive changes in circumstances. 

The annual goodwill impairment test
allows for the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting
unit is less than its carrying amount. An entity may choose to perform the qualitative assessment on none, some or all of its reporting
units or an entity may bypass the qualitative assessment for any reporting unit and proceed directly to step one of the quantitative impairment
test. If it is determined, on the basis of qualitative factors, that the fair value of a reporting unit is, more likely than not, less
than its carrying value, the quantitative impairment test is required. The quantitative impairment test calculates any goodwill impairment
as the difference between the carrying amount of a reporting unit and its fair value, but not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill.
As of June 30, 2021, there were qualitative factors that indicated goodwill was impaired, but after completing the quantitative assessment
it was determined that goodwill did not need to be impaired. 

An intangible asset is an identifiable
non-monetary asset without physical substance. Such an asset is identifiable when it is separable, or when it arises from contractual
or other legal rights. Separable assets can be sold, transferred, licensed, etc. Examples of intangible assets include computer software,
licenses, trademarks, patents, films and copyrights. The Company s intangible assets are finite lived assets and are amortized on
a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. 

(l) 
 Revenue Recognition 

The Company adopted ASU 2014-09, Revenue
from Contracts with Customers , and its related amendments (collectively known as ASC 606 ), effective January 1, 2019.
The Company determines revenue recognition through the following steps: 

- 
 Identification of a contract with a customer; 

- 
 Identification of the performance obligations in the contract; 

- 
 Determination of the transaction price; 

- 
 Allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and 

- 
 Recognition of revenue when or as the performance obligations are satisfied. 

Revenue is recognized when control
of the promised goods or services is transferred to customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to be
entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. As a practical expedient, the Company does not adjust the transaction price for the
effects of a significant financing component if, at contract inception, the period between customer payment and the transfer of goods
or services is expected to be one year or less. 

The Company s revenue is derived
from the sales of its products, which represents net sales recorded in the Company s condensed consolidated statements of operations.
Product sales are recognized when performance obligations under the terms of the contract with the customer are satisfied. Typically,
this would occur upon transfer of control, including passage of title to the customer and transfer of risk of loss related to those goods.
The Company measures revenue as the amount of consideration to which it expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring goods (transaction
price). The Company records reductions to revenue for estimated customer returns, allowances, markdowns and discounts. The Company bases
its estimates on historical rates of customer returns and allowances as well as the specific identification of outstanding returns, markdowns
and allowances that have not yet been received by the Company. The actual amount of customer returns and allowances is inherently uncertain
and may differ from the Company s estimates. If the Company determines that actual or expected returns or allowances are significantly
higher or lower than the reserves it established, it would record a reduction or increase, as appropriate, to net sales in the period
in which it makes such a determination. Reserves for returns, and markdowns are included within accrued expenses and other liabilities.
Allowance and discounts are recorded in accounts receivable, net and the value of inventory associated with reserves for sales returns
are included within prepaid expenses and other current assets on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. 

24 

The Company estimates warranty claims
reserves based on historical results and research and determined that a warranty reserve was not necessary as of June 30, 2021 or 2020. 

The Company also earns service revenue
from its other subsidiaries, including information technology and consulting services via Prakat, educational programs and courses via
IHG, and stem cell therapy procedures from Pacific Stems. For Prakat and Pacific Stems, revenues are recognized when performance obligations
have been satisfied and the services are complete. This is generally at a point of time upon written completion and client acceptance
of the project, which represents transfer of control to the customer. For IHG, revenues are recognized over the course of a semester while
services are performed. 

During the fiscal year, the Company
sold Likido units to its third-party manufacturer for testing purposes and for further resale to their customers. As of June 30, 2021,
the Company changed its relationship exclusively to that of a third-party manufacturer and requested the title of inventory to be returned
and adjusted the revenue accordingly. 

Deferred Revenue : 

ASC 606 requires disclosure of the
aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to the performance obligations that are unsatisfied at the end of the reporting period
and an explanation of when the entity expects to recognize revenue by either a quantitative basis or a qualitative basis. 

Deferred revenue for the year ended
June 30, 2021 was 219,999 compared to 176,291 for the year ended June 30, 2020. The current year balance of 219,999 consists of deliverables
from the following entities: 140,199 for IHG, 59,800 for Precision, and 20,000 for Prakat USA. It is anticipated that these products
will be delivered during the first quarter of 2022. The prior year balance of 176,291 was for Likido products.

(o) 
 Stock-based Compensation 

The Company records stock-based compensation
in accordance with ASC 718, Compensation Stock Compensation using the fair value method. All transactions in which goods
or services are the consideration received for the issuance of equity instruments are accounted for based on the fair value of the consideration
received or the fair value of the equity instrument issued, whichever is more reliably measurable. Equity instruments issued to employees
and the cost of the services received as consideration are measured and recognized based on the quoted market price of the equity instruments
issued. During the years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, stock-based compensation expenses were approximately 801,672 and 0, respectively. 

(p) 
 Foreign Currency Translation 

The
functional currency of the Company is the United States dollar. The functional currency of the Likido subsidiary is the British pound.
The functional currency of Prakat is the Indian rupee. The financial statements of the Company s subsidiaries were translated to
United States dollars in accordance with ASC 830, Foreign Currency Translation Matters , using period-end rates of exchange for
assets and liabilities, and average rates of exchange for the year for revenues and expenses. Gains and losses arising on foreign currency
denominated transactions are included in condensed consolidated statements of operations.

26 

(q) 
 Comprehensive Income (Loss) 

ASC
220, Comprehensive Income, establishes standards for the reporting and display of comprehensive loss and its components in the
condensed consolidated financial statements. During the year ended June 30, 2021, the Company s only component of comprehensive
income was foreign currency translation adjustments. 

(r) 
 Basic and Diluted Net Income (Loss) per Share 

The Company computes net income (loss)
per share in accordance with ASC 260, Earnings per Share . ASC 260 requires presentation of both basic and diluted earnings per
share EPS on the face of the income statement. Basic EPS is computed by dividing net income (loss) available to common
shareholders (numerator) by the weighted average number of shares outstanding (denominator) during the period. Diluted EPS gives effect
to all dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the periods using the treasury stock method and convertible preferred stock
using the if-converted method. In computing diluted EPS, the average stock price for the periods is used in determining the number of
shares assumed to be purchased from the exercise of stock options or warrants. 

The weighted average number of common
stock equivalents related to convertible notes payable of 56,801,471 shares was not included in diluted loss per share, because the effects
are antidilutive, for the year ended June 30, 2020. In accordance with ASC 260, Earnings Per Share , the following table
reconciles basic shares outstanding to fully diluted shares outstanding for the year ended June 30, 2021: 

Year Ended 

June 30, 2021 
 
 Weighted average number of common shares outstanding - Basic 
 70,318,073 
 
 Potentially dilutive common stock equivalents (convertible note payable - related party and accrued interest) 
 58,628,294 
 
 Weighted average number of common shares outstanding - Diluted 
 128,946,367 

The adjustments to the numerator were
insignificant during the year ended June 30, 2021 and there were no adjustments to the numerator during the year ended June 30, 2020.

 Income Taxes 

The Company accounts for income taxes
using the asset and liability method in accordance with ASC 740, Accounting for Income Taxes . The asset and liability method provides
that deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the
financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets
and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to
reverse. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to
be realized.

 Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
 
 In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-12, Income
 Taxes (Topic 740), Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes . The amendments in this Update simplify the accounting for income taxes
 by removing certain exceptions to the general principles in Topic 740. The amendments also improve consistent application of and simplify
 GAAP for other areas of Topic 740 by clarifying and amending existing guidance. For public business entities, the amendments in this Update
 are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2020. For all other entities,
 the amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after
 December 15, 2022. The Company adopted this pronouncement on July 1, 2020, and there was not a material impact on the financial statements. 
 
 In August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06, Accounting
 for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity s Own Equity , as part of its overall simplification initiative to reduce
 costs and complexity of applying accounting standards while maintaining or improving the usefulness of the information provided to users
 of financial statements. Among other changes, the new guidance removes from GAAP separation models for convertible debt that require the
 convertible debt to be separated into a debt and equity component, unless the conversion feature is required to be bifurcated and accounted
 for as a derivative or the debt is issued at a substantial premium. As a result, after adopting the guidance, entities will no longer
 separately present such embedded conversion features in equity, and will instead account for the convertible debt wholly as debt. The
 new guidance also requires use of the if-converted method when calculating the dilutive impact of convertible debt on earnings
 per share, which is consistent with the Company s current accounting treatment under the current guidance. The guidance is effective
 for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, and interim periods within those fiscal years, with
 early adoption permitted, but only at the beginning of the fiscal year. The Company is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of
 ASU 2020-06 will have on its consolidated financial position, results of operations and disclosures. 
 
 The Company has implemented all new accounting
 pronouncements that are in effect and that may impact its financial statements and does not believe that there are any other new accounting
 pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations.

The intangible assets for IHG are in the form

Accounting Standards Codification ASC Topic 805, Business Combinations ASC 805 ). 
 
 2) IHG s founder initially started the program approximately ten years ago offering a Certified Nurse s
Assistant Program (CNA), thus giving the intangible asset a minimum of a 10-year useful. 
 
 3) Under US GAAP, the cost of intangible assets is either amortized over their respective useful/legal lives,
or are tested for impairment on an annual basis. Pursuant to the costs incurred over a ten-year period to develop the CNA and other curriculums,
the Company has determined a minimum of a 10-year useful life is appropriate.

 Commitments and Contingencies 

Lease Commitments 

The Company determines if an arrangement
is a lease at inception. This determination generally depends on whether the arrangement conveys to the Company the right to control the
use of an explicitly or implicitly identified fixed asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. Control of an underlying
asset is conveyed to the Company if the Company obtains the rights to direct the use of and to obtain substantially all of the economic
benefits from using the underlying asset. The Company has lease agreements which include lease and non-lease components, which the Company
has elected to account for as a single lease component for all classes of underlying assets. Lease expense for variable lease components
is recognized when the obligation is probable. 

39 

Operating lease right of use ROU assets and lease liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. Operating
lease payments are recognized as lease expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The Company primarily leases buildings (real
estate) which are classified as operating leases. ASC 842 requires a lessee to discount its unpaid lease payments using the interest rate
implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot be readily determined, its incremental borrowing rate. As an implicit interest rate is not
readily determinable in the Company's leases, the incremental borrowing rate is used based on the information available at commencement
date in determining the present value of lease payments. 

The lease term for all of the Company's
leases includes the non-cancellable period of the lease plus any additional periods covered by either a Company option to extend (or not
to terminate) the lease that the Company is reasonably certain to exercise, or an option to extend (or not to terminate) the lease controlled
by the lessor. Options for lease renewals have been excluded from the lease term (and lease liability) for the majority of the Company's
leases as the reasonably certain threshold is not met. 

Lease payments included in the measurement
of the lease liability are comprised of fixed payments, variable payments that depend on index or rate, and amounts probable to be payable
under the exercise of the Company option to purchase the underlying asset if reasonably certain. 

Variable lease payments not dependent
on a rate or index associated with the Company's leases are recognized when the event, activity, or circumstance in the lease agreement
on which those payments are assessed as probable. Variable lease payments are presented as operating expenses in the Company's income
statement in the same line item as expense arising from fixed lease payments. As of and during the year ended June 30, 2021, management
determined that there were no variable lease costs. 

Right of Use Asset 

 In May 2020, the Company entered into
a five-year lease agreement to lease a commercial building in Escondido, California. The building is owned by a related party. The Company
recognized a right of use asset and liability of 822,389 and used an effective borrowing rate of 3.0 within the calculation. Imputed
interest is 53,399. The lease agreements mature in April 2025. Total amounts expensed under the lease during the years ended June 30,
2021 were 343,205 and 16,245, respectively, for which 99,155 is included accounts payable and accrued liabilities related parties. 

In May 2020, the Company entered into
three-year lease agreement to lease a warehouse in Brownsville, Texas. The Company recognized a right of use asset and liability of 177,124
and used an effective borrowing rate of 3.0 within the calculation. Imputed interest is 8,399. The lease agreements mature in April
2025. Total amounts expensed under the lease during the year ended June 20, 2021 and 2020 were 45,329 and 13,748, respectively. 

The Company s Prakat subsidiary
entered into a lease agreement to lease office space through September 2026. The Company recognized a right of use asset and liability
of 140,874 and used an effective borrowing rate of 9.2 within the calculation. 

In August 2020, the Company s
Likido subsidiary entered in a new operating agreement for warehouse space. The lease matures in July 2021. 

In June 2017, the Company s IHG
subsidiary entered into a lease for 3 separate office suites in San Diego, California. The lease expires in January 2022. 

In May 2021, the Company s PSC
subsidiary entered into a three year and 6-month lease agreement to lease a medical office space in Poway, California. The Company recognized
a right of use asset and liability of 277,856 and used an effective borrowing rate of 3.0 within the calculation.

 Income Taxes 

We file income tax returns in the United
States federal jurisdiction and in various state and local jurisdictions. In the normal course of business, we are subject to examination
by taxing authorities. The tax years ending 2018 through 2020 remain subject to examination for federal tax purposes and remain subject
to examination in significant state tax jurisdictions. The Company has yet to file their income tax return for the year ended June 30,
2021 

As of June 30, 2021, the Company had
federal and state net operating loss carry forwards of 20,036,664 that may be offset against future taxable income which will begin to
expire in 2038 through 2041. 

The reconciliation of income tax expense
computed at the U.S. federal statutory rate to the income tax provision for the years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020 is as follows:

The
provision for income tax for the year ended June 30, 2021 is included in selling, general and administrative expenses. 

Deferred
income taxes reflect the net tax effects of: (a) temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial
reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes; and (b) operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards. We record net deferred
tax assets to the extent we believe these assets will more likely than not be realized. In making such determination, we consider all
available positive and negative evidence, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable
income, tax planning strategies and recent financial operations. Significant components of deferred tax assets as of June 30, 2021 and
2020 were as follows:

Item 9A. Controls and Procedures 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls
and Procedures 

Our management, with the participation of our principal executive and
principal financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered
by this Annual Report. Based on that evaluation, our CEO and our CFO, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures as of the
end of the period covered by the Annual Report were not effective and that the information required to be disclosed by us in reports filed
under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules
and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our CEO and our CFO, as appropriate to allow timely decisions
regarding disclosure. A controls system cannot provide absolute assurance, however, that the objectives of the controls system are
met, and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within a company
have been detected. 

Management s Annual
Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate
internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Our internal control over financial
reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. 

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial
reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable
assurance of achieving their control objectives. 

Our management, with the participation of our CEO and our CFO, evaluated
the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting as of June 30, 2021. In making this assessment, management used
the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO in Internal Control
 Integrated Framework. Based on this evaluation, our management, with the participation of the CEO and CFO, concluded that,
as of June 30, 2021, our internal controls over financial reporting were not effective. 

During the year ended June 30, 2021, the CFO determined that Management's
assessment of the effectiveness of the registrant's internal control over financial reporting is as of the year ended June 30, 2021. The
Company believes that internal control over financial reporting is not effective. We and our independent registered public accounting
firm have identified the following current material weakness, which some were first identified at June 30, 2020 and others identified
as June 30, 2021, considering the nature and extent of our current operations and any risks or errors in financial reporting under current
operations: 

Lack
of Management oversight and review of the financial reporting process, including presentation of the financial statements and related
disclosures; 
 Lack
of procedures related to recognition of revenues; 
 Lack
of procedures related to the allocation of the purchase price, including acquired intangibles, in connection with business acquisitions. 

In May 2021, the Company the hired a CFO who is expected to develop
policies and procedures to mitigate the indicated weaknesses. The Company expect to be begin implementing procedures in early fiscal 2022. 

44 

This Annual Report does not include an attestation report of our registered
public accounting firm regarding our internal controls over financial reporting. Management s report was not subject to attestation
by our registered public accounting firm pursuant to rules of the SEC that permit us to provide only management s report in this
Annual Report. 

No Attestation Report by Independent
Registered Accountant 

The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting
as of June 30, 2021 has not been audited by our independent registered public accounting firm by virtue of our exemption from such requirement
as a smaller reporting company. 

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

There have been no changes in internal control over financial reporting
except as noted above.

Director Independence 

The OTC Bulletin Board does not have a requirement
that a majority of our Board of Directors be independent. However, with respect to the definition of independence utilized by NASDAQ,
our officers and directors would be deemed to be independent. 

Our Audit Committee is comprised of our officers
and directors. NASDAQ requires at least three members on the Audit Committee, each of whom must be independent. NASDAQ also requires that,
if its Chief Executive Officer s compensation is determined by its Compensation Committee, the Compensation Committee must be comprised
solely of independent directors. The Company currently does not meet either of these requirements. 

54 

The NASDAQ rules have both objective tests and
a subjective test for determining who is an independent director. The objective tests state, for example, that a director
is not considered independent if he or she is an employee of the Company or is a partner, executive officer or controlling stockholder
of an entity to which the company made, or from which the Company received, payments in the current or any of the past three fiscal years
that exceed the greater of 200,000 or 5 of the recipient s consolidated gross revenue for that year or a family member serves
in the current fiscal year or has served at any time during the last three fiscal years as an executive officer of the Company. The subjective
test states that an independent director must be a person who lacks a relationship that, in the opinion of the Board, would interfere
with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director.
