PART I 

ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

Corporate Background and General
Business Overview 

Summit Networks Inc. (together with
its subsidiary, the "Company") was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on July 8, 2014. Originally, the Company was formed
to engage in the development and operation of a business engaged in the distribution of glass craft products produced in China. On May
8, 2018, we acquired Real Capital Limited, a Hong Kong company ("Real Capital"), to seek opportunities in the food and beverage industry.
On March 31, 2019, the Company entered into a Share Purchase Agreement (the "Real Capital SPA") pursuant to which it sold its interests
in Real Capital. The closing of the Real Capital SPA occurred on April 10, 2019. 

On April 9, 2019, the Company entered
into a Share Exchange Agreement (the "MoralArrival Share Exchange Agreement") with MoralArrival Environmental and Blockchain Technology
Services Limited, a British Virgin Islands company ("MoralArrival"), and the beneficial owner of MoralArrival, which was Shuhua Liu. The
acquisition of MoralArrival was with a related party as Ms. Liu, who controls the shares of MoralArrival, also controls The Hass Group,
Inc., the Company's largest stockholder, and it was accounted for as acquisition of entity under common control. Under the terms of the
MoralArrival Share Exchange Agreement, the Company agreed to exchange 3,000,000 shares of its common stock for all the outstanding shares
of common stock of MoralArrival. MoralArrival had no business activity as of the date of acquisition. MoralArrival changed its name to
Goodwill Motion Enterprises, Inc. ("Goodwill") on May 4, 2020. 

On November 11, 2020, the Company entered
into a Mutual Rescission Agreement (the "Goodwill Rescission Agreement") with Goodwill and Shuhua Liu, the shareholder of Goodwill. Under
the terms of the Goodwill Rescission Agreement, the obligations of all parties to the MoralArrival Share Exchange Agreement shall be terminated
and the transactions contemplated thereby unwound and voided as if the MoralArrival Share Exchange Agreement was never entered into and
the transactions contemplated thereby never occurred. Pursuant to the Goodwill Rescission Agreement, Shuhua Liu delivered to the Company
3,000,000 shares of its common stock that were issued to Shuhua Liu under the MoralArrival Share Exchange Agreement, which the Company
canceled upon such delivery by Shuhua Liu. 

On July 17, 2019, the Company received
FINRA approval to effect a 10-for-1 stock dividend to holders of its common stock as of June 1, 2019, the record date for the dividend.
As a result, common stock figures, share capital, additional paid in capital, and earnings per share information have been retroactively
adjusted to reflect the stock dividend. 

On May 8, 2020, Sumnet (Canada) Inc.
("Sumnet (Canada)") was incorporated in Canada. Sumnet (Canada) issued all its ordinary shares to the Company on May 8, 2020 so that Sumnet
(Canada) became the wholly owned subsidiary of Company. On July 29, 2020, Smith Barney Enterprises Limited ("Smith Barney") was incorporated
in the British Virgin Islands. Smith Barney issued all its ordinary shares to the Company on July 29, 2020 so that Smith Barney became
the wholly owned subsidiary of Company. On August 28, 2020, Green Energy (HK) Limited ("Green Energy") was incorporated in Hong Kong.
Green Energy issued all its ordinary shares to Smith Barney on August 28, 2020 so that Green Energy became the wholly owned subsidiary
of Smith Barney. On September 27, 2020, Beijing Asian League Wins Technology Co., Ltd. ("Beijing ALW") was incorporated in People's Republic
of China. Green Energy subscribed all capital stock of Beijing ALW on September 27, 2020 so that Beijing ALW became the wholly owned subsidiary
of Green Energy. 

On January 20, 2021, Beijing ALW and
Green Energy entered into a series of contractual agreements (the "VIE Agreement") with Hengshui Jingzhen Environmental Company Limited
("Hengshui Jingzhen", or the "VIE"), whereby Beijing ALW gained control over Hengshui Jingzhen, a P.R. China company, which provides integrated
hazardous waste management services, including collecting, transferring, disposing, and recycling of hazardous waste, primarily in Hebei,
China. On March 29, 2021, the board of directors and a majority shareholder of the Company approved the termination of the VIE Agreements
with Hengshui Jingzhen. On the same date, Beijing ALW, Hengshui Jingzhen, and Hengshui Jingzhen's shareholders entered into a Termination
Agreement (the "Termination Agreement") to terminate all existing VIE Agreements signed on January 20, 2021. Pursuant to the Termination
Agreement, all of the rights and obligations under the existing VIE Agreements were terminated and the Company no longer had control of
Hengshui Jingzhen. 

Currently, we are in the early stage
of development of our new business plan which involves acting as an international agent through our wholly-owned subsidiaries, Smith Barney,
Green Energy and Beijing ALW, for a Chinese environmental company, Hengshui Jingzhen Environmental Technology Company Limited of Hebei,
China ("Hengshui"), to market its environmental technologies, equipment and products and to develop projects utilizing its environmental
technologies, equipment and products in worldwide markets. Hengshui provides solutions for the disposal of hazardous waste, pollution
treatment equipment and supplies fossil fuels made from industrial waste. It is a company that focuses on providing solutions for environmental
protection, especially on recycling and exploitation of hazardous waste. It possesses technology in connection with hazardous waste collection,
disposal and utilization, in order to handle hazardous waste more efficiently and regenerate energy from waste. However, to date, our
activities have been limited to capital formation, organization and development of a business plan. 

-3- 

We are presently evaluating the optimal
corporate and legal structures in China necessary to establish our business or to acquire and/or invest in existing environmental technology
businesses. We aim to start marketing the environmental equipment and solutions in 2022 across the China, Japan, the Southeast Asia and
the United States. The services and products that we plan to market include disposal of hazardous waste, pollution treatment equipment
and fossil fuels made from industrial waste. We desire to market Hengshui's products by acquiring businesses in possession of the waste
conversion technology, organizing conferences nationwide with potential enterprise client in need of waste disposal services, and partnering
with local environmental protection ventures to expand Hengshui's outreach to hundreds of factories across China. However, our plan to
operate in the hazardous waste disposal industry may be adversely impacted by the outbreak of coronavirus, which was first reported to
have surfaced in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, and is now continuing to spread throughout other parts of the world. Although China has
made great efforts to contain the spread of the virus and had brought the outbreak under control, the economy, financial market and businesses
in China have been suffering from the pandemic. 

On January 20, 2021, the Company changed
its fiscal year-end from July 31 to September 30.

from those discussed in the forward- looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not

Results of Operations 

During the year ended September 30,
2021, July 31, 2020 and the two-months ended September 30,2020, we generated no revenues. Our operating expenses for the same periods
were comprised of general and administrative expenses of 572,682, 131,525 and 12,193, respectively, resulting in net loss of 454,074
for the year ended September 30, 2021 compared to a net loss of 131,525 for the year ended July 31, 2020 and net loss of 12,193 for
the two-months ended September 30, 2020. Our general and administrative expenses consisted of mainly professional fees for the year ended
September 30, 2021, and consisted of mainly management fees, chief executive fees and director fees for the year ended September 30, 2020.
The decrease of general and administrative expenses was mainly due to the decrease of management fees, chief executive fees and director
fees. 

Our total assets as of September 30,
2021 were 84,200. 

On April 9, 2019, the Company entered
into the MoralArrival Share Exchange Agreement. Under the terms of the MoralArrival Share Exchange Agreement, the Company issued 3,000,000
shares of common stock to Ms. Liu on January 7, 2020. This transaction was rescinded in November 2020. 

As of September 30, 2021, the Company
had 62,049,990 shares of common stock issued and outstanding. 

As of September 30, 2021, September
30, 2020 and July 31, 2020, there are a total of 579,000, 518,607 and 518,607 in amounts respectively, due to related parties and shareholders
were interest free, unsecured and payable on demand. 

Even if we are able to obtain sufficient
number of service agreements at the end of the twelve months' period, there is no guarantee that we will be able to attract and more importantly,
retain enough customers to cover our expenditures. If we are unable to generate a significant amount of revenue, then it would materially
affect our financial condition. 

Based on our current operating plan,
we may need to obtain additional financing to operate our business for the next twelve months. Additional financing, whether through public
or private equity or debt financing, or if available, may be on terms unacceptable to us. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

As for the year ended September 30,
2021, September 30, 2020 and July 31, 2020, the Company had a negative cash flow of 211,725, 12,193 and a positive cash flow of 304,243,
respectively. The Company's principal sources and uses of funds were as follows: 

For the year ended September 30, 2021,
the Company used 385,189 in cash for operations as compared to 12,193 and 161,722 for the year ended September 30, 2020 and July 31
2020 respectively. Such increase was primarily due to lower net loss in year ended September 30, 2020 and July 31, 2020. The net
cash provided by the financing activities for the year ended September 30, 2021 was 179,000 as compared to 465,965 from related parties
for the year ended July 31, 2020. Such decrease was a result of less advances from the related parties. 

-6- 

The Company's financial statements
have been prepared on a going-concern basis which contemplates the realization of assets and the settlement of liabilities and commitments
in the normal course of business. The Company's liquidity and capital needs relate primarily to working capital and other general corporate
requirements. The Company's operations do not currently provide cash flow. To date, the Company has funded its operations by advances
from related parties. The business will require significant amounts of capital in the near term to sustain operations and make the investments
it needs to continue operations and execute its longer-term business plan. As of September 30, 2021 we had cash of 80,878 and there were
outstanding liabilities of 738,333. As of September 30, 2020, we had 292,603 in cash and the outstanding liabilities were 528,132.
The working capital deficits were 654,133 and 230,059, for September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. These factors raise substantial
doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern as discussed in the footnotes to our financial statements. The Company will be
unable to conduct its planned operations unless we obtain financing in the near term to meet the needs of our on-going operations, generate
future revenue from operations and/or obtain the necessary financing to meet our obligations and repay our liabilities arising from normal
business operations when they come due. In order to implement its business plan, management's plan includes raising capital by equity
and/or debt financing. However, management cannot provide any assurances that the Company will be successful in accomplishing any of its
plans. If we issue equity or equity equivalents to raise additional funds, our existing stockholders will experience substantial dilution
and the new holders of securities may have rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of our existing stockholders. Management
also cannot provide any assurance that unforeseen circumstances will not increase the need for the Company to raise additional capital
on an immediate basis. There can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to raise funds if at all, or on terms acceptable to
the Company in which case the Company may be unable to continue its operations or to meet its obligations. If adequate capital is not
available when needed, we will be required to significantly modify our business model or cease operations. 

On March 11, 2020 the World Health
Organization declared the novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) a global pandemic and recommended containments and mitigation measures
worldwide. The Company is monitoring this closely, and although operations have not been materially affected by the coronavirus outbreak
to date, the ultimate severity of the outbreak is uncertain. Operations of the Company are ongoing. Further the uncertain nature
of the spread of COVID-19 globally may impact our business operations due to the quarantine of employees, customers, and third-party service
providers. 

Off-Balance
Sheet Arran g ements 

We do not have any off-balance sheet
arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition,
revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
 To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Summit Network Inc. 
 Opinion on the Financial Statements 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Summit Network Inc (the Company as of September 30, 2021 and September 30, 2020, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders equity, and cash flows for the years then ended September 30, 2021 and the two-months ended September, 2020, and the related notes to the consolidated financial statements and schedule (collectively, the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of September 30, 2021, and September 30, 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years ended September 30, 2021, and the two-months ended September 2020 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
 Substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern 

 As discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. The Company had limited operations during the period from July 8, 2014 (date of inception) to September 30, 2021 resulting in accumulated deficit of 1,110,050 and has not generated any revenue. There is no guarantee that Company will generate revenue and net income in the future. At September 30, 2021, the Company had a working capital deficiency of 654,133. These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt regarding the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. Management s plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 2 to the accompanying financial statements. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
 To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Summit Networks, Inc. 
 Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Summit Networks, Inc. (the Company) as of July 31, 2020, and the related consolidated statement of operations, stockholders deficit, and cash flows for year ending July 31, 2020, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of July 31, 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year ended July 31, 2020, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
 Going Concern 
 As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. The Company had limited operations during the period from July 8, 2014 (date of inception) to July 31, 2020, resulting in accumulated deficit of 643,783 and has not generated any revenue. There is no guarantee that Company will generate revenue and net income in the future. At July 31, 2020, the Company had a working capital deficiency of 217,866. These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt regarding the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. Management s plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 2 to the accompanying financial statements. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

 In assessing the realization of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. Based on the assessment, management has established a full valuation allowance against all of the deferred tax assets relating to the NOL period because it is more likely than not that all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.

ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS
WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE 

On August 26, 2021 (the "Effective
Date"), the board of directors of Summit Networks, Inc. (the "Company") terminated the engagement of Prager Metis CPA's. LLC ("PMC"),
the Company's prior independent registered public accounting firm, effective immediately. In addition, on the Effective Date, the board
of directors of the Company approved the termination of PMC and the appointment by the Company of Assentsure PAC ("Assentsure") to serve
as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm, effective July 8, 2021. 

PMC's audit reports on the Company's
financial statements for the two most recent fiscal years did not contain an adverse opinion or a disclaimer of opinion, and were not
qualified or modified as to audit scope or accounting principles. 

During the two most recent fiscal years
and through the Effective Date, there were (i) no disagreements between the Company and PMC on any matter of accounting principles or
practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure, which disagreements, if not resolved to the satisfaction of
PMC, would have caused PMC to make reference to the subject matter of such disagreements in connection with its audit reports on the Company's
financial statements for such years, and no reportable events as that term is defined in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K. 

ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Disclosure controls and procedures
are controls and other procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under
the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms. Disclosure
controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed
in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our Certifying Officer or persons performing
similar functions, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

We conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness
of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) as of
September 30, 2021. This evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and
our Chief Financial Officer. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of
September 30, 2021, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective due to the presence of material weaknesses in internal control
over financial reporting. 

Material Weakness in Internal
Control Over Financial Reporting 

A material weakness is a deficiency,
or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material
misstatement of the company's annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Management has
identified the following material weaknesses which have caused management to conclude that, as of September 30, 2021, our disclosure controls
and procedures were not effective: (i) lack of a functioning audit committee due to a lack of a majority of independent members and a
lack of a majority of outside directors on our board of directors, resulting in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring
of required internal controls and procedures; (ii) inadequate segregation of duties consistent with control objectives; and (iii) ineffective
controls over period end financial disclosure and reporting processes. Because a material weakness in the Company's internal controls
over financial reporting existed as of September 30, 2021 and has not been remediated, the Company's disclosure controls and procedures
were not effective as of September 30, 2021. 

In an effort to remediate the identified
material weaknesses and other deficiencies and enhance our internal controls, we plan to initiate, the following series of measures in
connection with identifying an operating business to acquire and when funds are available to us: 

1.
We plan to appoint one or more outside directors to our board of directors who would be appointed to an audit committee resulting in a
fully functioning audit committee who will undertake oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures. 

2.
We plan to create a position to segregate duties consistent with control objectives and will increase our personnel resources and technical
accounting expertise within the accounting function. 

3.
We plan to prepare written policies and procedures for accounting and financial reporting to establish a formal process to close our books
monthly on an accrual basis and account for all transactions, including equity and debt transactions. 

We anticipate that we will, at least
partially, begin to implement these initiatives in the current fiscal year. 

This Report does not include an attestation
report of our independent registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting and none is required.

Changes in Internal Controls over
Financial Reporting 

As of the end of the period covered
by this report, there have been no changes in the internal controls over financial reporting that materially affected, or are reasonably
likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

ITEM 9B. OTHER INFORMATION 

On November 11, 2020, the Company entered
into a Mutual Rescission Agreement (the "Goodwill Rescission Agreement") with Goodwill and Shuhua Liu, the shareholder of Goodwill. Under
the Goodwill Rescission Agreement, Shuhua Liu agreed to deliver to the Company 3,000,000 shares of its common stock that were issued to
Liu under the MoralArrival Share Exchange Agreement, which the Company agreed to cancel upon such delivery by Shuhua Liu. Under the terms

The Board and Committees 

Our Board of Directors at this time
does not maintain a separate audit, nominating or compensation committee. Functions customarily performed by such committees are performed
by the Board as a whole. We are an early stage company with very limited operations, therefore our Board of Directors does not deem it
necessary to have more than one director or a nominating or compensation committee. We have not paid any compensation to any officer or
director. Decisions relating to director nominations or compensation can be made on a case by case basis by the Board of Directors. Our
Board of Directors would consider any shareholder nominee at such time as it is made. Our Board of Directors does not believe that a defined
policy with regard to the consideration of candidates recommended by stockholders is necessary at this time because it believes that,
given the limited scope of our operations, a specific nominating policy would be premature and of little assistance until our business
operations are at a more advanced level. There are no specific, minimum qualifications that the Board believes must be met by a candidate
recommended by the Board of Directors. We do not pay any fee to any third party or parties to identify or evaluate or assist in identifying
or evaluating potential nominees. 

We have not adopted practices or polices
regarding employee, officer and director hedging in accordance with Item 407(i) of Regulation S-K. 

Legal Proceedings 

To the knowledge of our management,
there are no material proceedings to which any of our directors, officers or affiliates are a party adverse to our Company. 

Code of Ethics

ITEM 13. CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS,
RELATED TRANSACTIONS AND DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE 

On April 9, 2019, the Company entered
into MoralArrival Share Exchange Agreement with MoralArrival, a British Virgin Islands company, and the sole shareholder of MoralArrival
was Shuhua Liu. The acquisition of MoralArrival was with a related party, as Ms. Liu controls The Hass Group, Inc., the Company's largest
stockholder and it was accounted for as acquisition of entity under common control. Under the terms of that MoralArival Share Exchange
Agreement, the Company agreed to exchange 3,000,000 shares of its common stock for all the outstanding shares of common stock of MoralArrival.
As a result of this transaction, MoralArrival has become a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. The Company issued 3,000,000 shares
of common stock to Ms. Liu in January 2020. 

On June 15, 2020, the Company entered
into loan agreements with Shuhua Liu and Chiu Kin Wong for an aggregate loan of 400,000 with no interest. Shuhua Liu agreed to lend 280,000
to the Company and Chiu Kin Wong agreed to lend 120,000, both for the Company's working capital in connection with going public, merger
and acquisition. The Company agrees to repay the loan balance after its first financing activity. Shuhua Liu is the Chief Executive Officer
and Director of the Company. Chiu Kin Wong is a shareholder of the Company. The amount of principal outstanding as of November 13, 2020
is 400,000. No principal or interest has been paid by the Company during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021. During the period
ended September 30, 2021, the company has borrowed 179,000 from its shareholders to pay certain expenses. 

On November 11, 2020, the Company entered
into a Mutual Rescission Agreement (the "Goodwill Rescission Agreement") with Goodwill and Shuhua Liu, the shareholder of Goodwill. Under
the Goodwill Rescission Agreement, Shuhua Liu agreed to deliver to the Company 3,000,000 shares of its common stock that were issued to
Liu under the MoralArrival Share Exchange Agreement, which the Company agreed to cancel upon such delivery by Shuhua Liu. Under the terms
of the Goodwill Rescission Agreement, the obligations of all parties to the MoralArrival Share Exchange Agreement shall be terminated
and the transactions contemplated thereby unwound and voided as if the MoralArrival Share Exchange Agreement was never entered into and
the transactions contemplated thereby never occurred. 

Our Board of Directors is responsible
to approve all related party transactions. We have not adopted written policies and procedures specifically for related person transactions.
